## Attention Grantees:

Please read the following carefully and in its entirety before you seek to extend your project using this means. Note that NSF SBIR/STTR awardees cannot grant themselves no-cost extensions!

## Phase I Grantees: 
Applying for a No-Cost Extension might constrain the choices of deadline date to submit your Phase II proposal. Contact your Program Director to discuss!

## Phase II Grantees:
You will not be able to submit a Phase IIB request when in the no-cost extension window. In general, no-cost extensions do not change the deadline dates for Phase II supplemental requests.

### Instructions
1. From the Research.gov Homepage http://www.research.gov, select the "Notifications & Requests" option, located under the "Awards & Reporting" column.
2. Enter your login information and press "Log In" (Last Name, NSF ID, and Password).
3. The Notifications & Requests screen appears; Select the "Prepare New" Option near the top of the page.
4. On the next screen, select the "No Cost Extensions" radio button in Step 1 and "No-Cost Extension" in the Step 2 drop-down menu.
5. On the next page, fill out the required information in the "Revised End Date" drop-down menu, the "Remaining Funds" text field, the "Justification for NSF-Approved No-Cost Extension" text field, and the "Plan for use of unobligated funds" text field. If applicable, also fill out the "Explanation for late request" text field.
6. Click on the "Save & Submit to NSF" button at the bottom of the page.  

Note the following requirements for no-cost extensions from the NSF's Grant Proposal Guide:

- The request must be submitted to NSF at least 45 days prior to the expiration date of the grant. The request must explain the need for the extension and include an estimate of the unobligated funds remaining and a plan for their use. As indicated above, that unobligated funds may remain at the expiration of the grant is not in itself sufficient justification for an extension.
- The plan must adhere to the previously approved objectives of the project. Any NSF-approved no-cost extension will be issued by an NSF Grants Officer in the form of an amendment to the grant specifying a new expiration date. Grantees are cautioned not to make new commitments or incur new expenditures after the expiration date in anticipation of a no-cost extension.
