    implement a proprietary rare earth extraction process on recycled NdFeB magnets
    at pilot scale to prove commercial production feasibility. By recovering rare
    earth elements (REEs) readily available in waste streams, this effort will help
    create a secondary source of these critical elements, thereby reducing U.S. dependence
    on an unstable, limited supply from China. This will, in turn, lay the groundwork
    necessary for the production of cutting-edge technologies reliant upon these materials
    to return to the U.S.  The Nd and Dy elements which are recovered from this process
    are the critical components that increase the efficiency of electric motors by
    up to 30%. The availability of these resources will also significantly improve
    the vertical integration of manufacturing for national security technologies that
    depend heavily upon REEs, such as guided missile actuators and jet-fighter control
    panels. This project will also impact the electronics recycling sector by creating
    a new, reliable revenue stream for electronics recycling companies.\n \nThe process
    to reclaim REEs from NdFeB magnets is simple and energy-efficient, with a minimal
    environmental footprint. The Phase I SBIR project demonstrated the feasibility
    of developing the process beyond laboratory scale to pilot scale, improved the
    purity of the end product and reduced the amount of waste from processing.  The
    Phase II project will focus on the following objectives: 1) designing a scale
    up strategy and building a pilot scale production plant; 2) optimizing the pilot
    scale production process; 3) maximizing product recovery at pilot scale; 4) designing
    a wastewater treatment and reuse strategy; and 5) minimizing residual contamination
    in the final products.  To achieve these Phase II objectives, we will develop
    process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times
    at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields
    of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage,
    we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with
    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all
    stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products,
    including wastewater and residual metal impurities."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to a wide range of electronics in the areas of communications, Internet, portable electronics, and power electronics. Although magnetic based transformers have been the industry standard for over a century they have many negatives including miniaturization difficulties, electromagnetic interference issues, and issues with larger voltage step-up applications. The main goal of the research is to develop a ceramic replacement for magnetic transformers that is both conducive to miniaturization, provides higher power densities, provides a large increase in safe operating temperatures, and that is cost competitive with standard magnetic devices. This technology will provide important advantages for many applications; the ability to produce at low cost also opens up large new markets that are not easily reached using conventional magnetics.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to develop new low temperature sintering processes and transformer structures that enable the use of base metal electrodes to replace very expensive platinum. This drastically reduces costs of ceramic transformers and substantially improves performance due to the fact that a poor electrical/thermal conductor, Platinum, is now replaced with base metal (Copper) that is a high performance electrical/thermal conductor. This translates into both higher power throughput in devices that are lighter weight and lower profile and also a new ability to now match the high temperature range of wide bandgap power devices. The success of this program immediately leads to a revolutionary next step of being able to insert power management/conversion electronics directly within integrated circuits such as in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to produce a better natural gas treatment membrane that will allow end users to capture the ease of processing and environmental advantages of membrane technology at a substantially reduced price.  Natural gas processing to remove CO2 and other contaminants is the largest industrial gas separation application with an estimated global separation equipment market of approximately $2-3 billion per year. At present, membrane processes have a 10% market share, while amine absorption processes account for the bulk of the market.  Conventional membrane materials are limited by their relatively modest CO2/CH4 selectivity, which offsets their environmental and efficiency advantages. The novel perfluoro polymer membranes developed in this program show enhanced performance when treating gas mixtures at industrial relevant conditions.  Study of these perfluoro polymer membranes will improve scientific understanding of structure/property relationships for a new family of materials.  Most importantly, applied at a commercial scale, these new perfluoro membranes offer the potential to overcome the limitations of prior membranes, and thereby, transform natural gas processing.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to complete the development of novel perfluoropolymer membranes for use in natural gas CO2 removal. During Phase I, membranes with superior CO2/CH4 separation performance compared to commercial membranes were identified in comparative high-pressure mixture tests. In Phase II, the research and development plan is to scale up production of the most promising perfluoro polymer.  An optimized membrane based on this polymer will be made on a roll-to-roll production line and fabricated into membrane modules. These modules will be evaluated in laboratory parametric experiments and validation tested at an operating natural gas field site.  Results from these tests will be used to update an economic evaluation of the perfluoro membranes compared to conventional technology applied to natural gas CO2 removal.  Completion of these technical objectives will bring this advanced membrane technology to the cusp of commercialization.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a portable, low cost blood typing and anemia screening device for use in blood donation centers, hospitals, humanitarian efforts and the military.   This helps society because every two seconds in United States someone needs blood, yet less than 4% of Americans donate blood.  Unfortunately, 15-20% of blood collected is wasted due to over collection of unneeded blood types and related blood type logistics.  12 million units of blood are collected annually in US with 108 million units worldwide.   U.S. blood centers are under significant economic pressures to reduce per unit blood costs and thus waste reduction tools and strategies are in demand.  Blood unit costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so this device provides the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) to reduce blood product waste and better match supply with hospital demand.   This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. The potential economic savings has the potential to be $400M and will contribute to reducing the overall cost of U.S. health care.

    The proposed project will advance knowledge across multiple fields.  It adapts knowledge in microfluidics and the use of electric fields to characterize cells to identify the molecular expression on blood cells responsible for ABO-Rh blood type.  This project advances the use of electric fields to rapidly measure cell concentration.  This project develops software for real time tracking of cell population motion, which is highly valuable in many cell microscopy applications.  This project also adapts advanced pattern recognition tools like machine learning to extract even more information from the cell behaviors. This work also extends statistical analysis from static population means to analysis of functional data - a field in its infancy - via a critical application.   Finally, the device and electronics engineering will advance under the principle that "simple is best", leading to fewer potential failure points and less costly manufacture. This work advances scientific knowledge and will be published and widely disseminated after securing additional IP. It is also a powerful alternative to expensive antigen/antibody molecular recognition reactions (i.e. traditional blood typing) for medical screening and diagnosis for future point of care diagnostic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

    The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to help protect the environment by replacing existing toxic and environmentally-hazardous corrosion inhibitors used as lubricant additives with more eco-friendly alternatives. Release of lubricants (for example from loss during use, improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental spillage, or off-shore drilling) has the potential to cause damage to the environment. Awareness of the toxic nature of current lubricant additives is a driver to develop new technologies for more environmentally friendly products. This project addresses the development of novel, environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor lubricant additives. Besides the environmental benefits of the new technology, the lubricant industry  may also benefit by expansion into environmentally sensitive market sectors (for example, marine lubricants used on ships) through the use of safer and less toxic additives. The new products also utilize non-petroleum based raw materials from renewable and sustainable resources, thus reducing dependence on petroleum. Apart from being non-toxic and environmentally friendly, the proposed products are also expected to be more effective inhibitors as compared to the products currently used in the market.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to design and develop environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors providing high performance while meeting the eco-toxicological requirements of environmentally acceptable lubricants (EAL), including bio-lubricants. The use of corrosion inhibitors in lubricants is essential to protect metal surfaces. Unfortunately, many commercial corrosion inhibitors present issues with aquatic toxicity, persistence in the environment, and/or bioaccumulation that render them unacceptable for use in EAL or bio-lubricants. Awareness of the eco- toxicological problems of current inhibitors and the implementation of new regulations mandating the use of EAL in certain applications (e.g. marine lubricants) has created an urgent need in the market to replace existing products and the opportunity to develop new technologies for corrosion inhibition. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of corrosion inhibitors for biolubricants; namely (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead products in the laboratory set-up; as identified in Phase I, (c) assessment of eco-toxicological properties using industry standard OECD/ASTM test methods and structure activity relationship (SAR) calculations, and (d) product storage stability testing.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology is giving rise to new methods and innovation in multiple fields across the biomedical and biotechnological industries.  On-going progress is generating growth in the bioprinting market creating demands for new job skills in the near future.  To address industry needs, schools must ready themselves with the right tools and equipment to train next generation students.  Moreover, increased accessibility of technology in education can help to empower students and expand their scientific creativity.  However, current 3D bioprinting instrumentation are primarily designed for industry use and expensive.  Technical barriers further prohibit many schools from gaining access.  To truly democratize technology innovation for next generation scientists and engineers, a sustainable solution catered to the education market is necessary.  This SBIR Phase II project is aimed at addressing this opportunity gap and will create an affordable 3D bioprinting equipment and educational toolkit catered to high schools and colleges.  The proposed bioprinting equipment will be multi-functional so that teachers can use it for a variety of classroom applications.  In addition, the educational toolkit will include student-friendly software tools facilitating experiments in 3D bioprinting, bioreagent kits, and curriculum to support teachers in using the bioprinters in the classroom.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to create a highly functional and versatile bioprinting equipment and educational toolkit for the high school and college education market.  The motivation behind this work is to increase accessibility of new and cutting-edge tools to next generation students who will not only benefit from gaining industry-relevant skills they need in the near future but provide them with the opportunity to innovate.  The proposed multi-functional bioprinting equipment will facilitate increased hands-on learning activities in the classroom, a key component in learning science and practice engineering, and project-based learning.  To this end, the development of curriculum to support use of the 3D bioprinter is critical in manifesting adoption in the classroom.  From the hardware engineering perspective, the project will focus on engineering design to achieve integration of multiple functionalities in the proposed bioprinting equipment.  Software tools that facilitate design and creation of bio-experimentation, and evaluation of experimental results through imaging tools will be developed to support activities spanning across the entire bioprinting process.  Finally, bioreagent kits will be created to support consumable needs for the 3D bioprinter.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

- abstractText: "This Phase II project will commercialize a big-data analytics-based
    adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning.
    The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time
    learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional
    aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social
    interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning
    outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized
    learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for
    online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose
    to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in
    real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners.
    The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated
    by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate
    data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of
    the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns
    that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  \n\nBig data,
    generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each
    learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed
    methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the
    Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback
    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical
    analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials
    of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection
    of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools
    will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each
    learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of
    an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected
    at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development
    of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery)
    that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven
    feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary
    feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education
    in schools and colleges."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in line with the trend in medicine towards a prevention paradigm, following the premise that preventing problems is generally less costly than treating the problem or managing a future deficit. Excessive noise in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has been clearly linked to cognitive deficits among the patients of these care areas. However, isolating the infants from any voice contact is also detrimental to language skill development. This project will investigate and develop a system that will provide for a more stable stay in the NICU, mitigate neurologic complications leading to developmental delays, and lessen the occurrence of hearing loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics? guidelines state that neonatal patients should not be exposed to noises greater than 45dBA yet hospitals struggle to achieve this. Deploying such a noise attenuation system with voice pass through capabilities will help hospitals provide the proper environment for their neonatal populations. Hospital administrators and clinical directors have expressed enthusiasm for this solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop an active noise reduction system for use in an NICU incubator, while allowing a parent's voice to pass through essentially unattenuated. To achieve the noise attenuation, the unwanted noise is monitored outside and inside the incubator and a corresponding signal exactly out of phase with the detected noise is used to largely cancel the unwanted noise. The system will employ a multi-channel hybrid system employing both feedback and feedforward elements. While a more complex approach, this has been shown to have performance advantages over simpler solutions. In this phase, the size of the zone of attenuation will be expanded, the algorithm will be adapted to multiple incubators having differing shapes, and a set of fail-safe provisions will be implemented.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of new tools to understand the dynamic behavior of cellular machinery that is disrupted in disease. Unraveling the dynamic aspects of cellular physiology that may be targeted therapeutically requires new technologies capable of profiling the response of entire signaling pathways to pharmacological intervention targeted at single pathway nodes. The availability of physiologically relevant live-cell models that are compatible with visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal regulation of disease-relevant signal transduction pathways and cellular machinery will be key to enabling this approach.  The ability to monitor multiple facets of key cancer signaling pathways in this way represents a valuable opportunity to identify potent and selective therapeutic inhibitors of "undruggable" targets, such as the Ras protein, which is a crucial driver of more than 30% of cancers. By enabling development of a robust and scalable high-throughput live-cell assay platform, this technology may reduce the time and cost to pinpoint the mechanism of action and off-target effects of pharmaceutical chemicals, thus delivering new capabilities to rapidly and cost-effectively identify safe and effective therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a robust and flexible platform for rapid generation of precision-engineered, multicolor fluorescent cell lines and associated high-throughput microscopy-based assays. This platform contrasts with industry standard methods for developing such cell lines and assays, which are lengthy and inflexible.  The project comprises optimization and execution of four components:  1) Generation of a panel of cell lines compatible with rapid, reliable stable reporter integration; 2) Delivery of a library of approximately 25 multicolor reporters of the Ras/MAPK pathway; 3) Rapid generation and validation of a library of  approximately 100 validated stable reporter cell lines expressing all therapeutically relevant mutations and isoforms of the Ras/MAPK pathway;  and 4) 384-well plate assay development and screening of these Ras/MAPK reporter cells using tool compounds. The project aims to demonstrate the capability of the platform to rapidly pinpoint compound mechanism of action and potential off-target effects by monitoring multiple facets of previously inaccessible biology associated with a critical, high-value oncology target in live cells. The standardized platform established in the course of this project will allow rapid expansion to additional clinically relevant signaling pathways.

    This SBIR Phase II project offers a unique approach to teaching the difficult content of operating with fractions through interactive, adaptive games. Existing products are not effective at teaching fractions, and half of US eighth graders cannot correctly order three fractions, a fourth grade standard. Current research and the Common Core State Standards emphasize using a number line to teach fractions, which is a more effective approach; however, leading curricula are not fully aligned to this method. This project aims to improve 3rd-5th grade students' understanding of fractions through engaging apps that encourage estimation and problem-solving. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF's mission of improving mathematics education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace for engaging, effective software that aligns with Common Core and provides data-driven intervention support. This software will be specially designed for children who struggle in mathematics and will meet the criteria for intervention software, further increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate income.

    This project aims to improve children's use of efficient strategies in estimating and solving fractions arithmetic by targeting children?s metastrategic awareness and metacognitive abilities. This project will include the development of a series of fractions apps and game-based data reporting for teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions. Extracting actionable insight from children?s gameplay rather than from standardized tests is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change teaching and learning. The development process will include wireframing novel gameplay and developing app components and features. The backend system will identify learning patterns within clickstream data collected during play and apply data-mining techniques to these patterns. Instead of assessing single actions as correct or incorrect, the backend will identify series of actions and associate them with a particular strategy. This data will be used to inform instructors, test hypotheses, and provide evidence for learning. A dynamic content generation engine will use the insights extracted from student data to provide learners with highly targeted, fine-tuned activities. The project?s research will include both informal design research and a randomized control study with 3rd-5th grade students to determine the effects of using the software on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions.

- abstractText: "This Phase II project aims to develop software to automatically assess
    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps
    students practice, track, and improve their public speaking habits."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.
