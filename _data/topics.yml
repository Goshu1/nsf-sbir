    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to create an ultra-high-speed variable focus optical element meeting the robust performance needs associated with laser manufacturing.  The ability to change the focal spot location in laser processing is necessary to accommodate the rapid throughput and complex materials shapes and structures generally encountered in industrial manufacturing.  However, the state-of-the-art remains slow, mechanically moving lenses, which can lead to increased production times, reduced accuracy, increased system complexity and overall increased cost.  Instead, this work proposes a paradigm-shifting approach to variable focus by developing a new type of liquid lens that uses sound to shape and refocus light.  In order to implement this rapidly growing, high impact technology in the manufacturing arena, the key challenge is to manage and reduce laser heating of the device which can lead to undesirable optical effects.  By using a combination of experimental tests and numerical models we expect to determine the optimum design conditions that minimize heating effects and maximize refractive power of the lens. With the inclusion of passive and active cooling approaches we expect to enable lens operation for production-level laser manufacturing across different power and pulse duration scales.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will have significant repercussions in the laser manufacturing industry, an increasingly important industry which is in many ways responsible for the efficiency and economical cost of every day materials and devices.  Specifically, this project addresses a technological market need which will reduce the manufacturing cycle, and streamline processes by providing additional control of the laser beam in the z axis without effecting the x and y axis resolution; thereby, improving the manufacturing yield by increasing the precision, and speed of laser manufacturing systems. Improvements in manufacturing yield are incredibly important to both societal and environmental conditions as they lead to a reduction in waste, an increase in the quality of the parts produced, and a reduction in manufacturing costs. Additionally this proposal will increase scientific and technical understanding on how to applying ultra-high speed z-scanning optical devices in high power lasers systems for manufacturing operation.  This will not only lead to the incorporation of such devices in already existing systems but more importantly, enable new innovations such as the creation of entirely new manufacturing approaches with increased performance and capabilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two roadblocks to reducing the cost of wind energy: the labor-intensive construction process, and size limitations imposed by road or rail transport for turbine components. The former issue drives up manufacturing costs and reduces US competitiveness with countries with inexpensive labor, while the latter forces sub-optimized tower designs and prevents turbines from growing larger and taking advantage of faster, steadier winds at higher hub heights. This project addresses both of these problems by adapting spiral welding - a well understood system for pipe and piling manufacturing - to wind tower production. Spiral welding is highly automated, requiring as little as 10% of the labor of the equivalent manual process. It also combines multiple operations into a single machine that can be operated on-site, eliminating transport costs and barriers. This project's innovation is to adapt existing spiral welders - which can manufacture only straight, constant wall-thickness pipe - to producing tapered, variable wall thickness towers. A novel material geometry and automated control of machine parameters are the keys to transforming the standard system to one optimized for turbine tower production. With on-site spiral welding of turbine towers, significant reductions in cost of wind energy are possible.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in many areas: technical, commercial and environmental. The system?s major contribution is an increase in the use of wind energy for US electricity, enabled by both reduction in energy cost and increase in the number of cost effective wind sites. Reducing the cost of tall towers enables increases in the height and size of wind turbines, allowing them to reach and be optimized for steadier, higher speed winds. With these increase in size and optimization, decreases in cost of wind energy of 12% (for 120m tall towers) or more are possible. In addition, the US land area for which wind energy is cost effective can be doubled at 120m hub heights. Spiral-welding of turbine towers also provides US jobs and increases American competitiveness with overseas producers. Because on-site production is inherently local, manufacturing jobs are created in the communities where wind turbines are installed. Also, this method gives local production a major cost advantage over imports by producing towers that are too large to transport from port to wind farm. This allows domestic manufacturing to not only compete, but dominate in a domestic tower market worth roughly $1B in 2011.

    a novel manufacturing route to obtain a new class of high-figure-of-merit (ZT)
    thermoelectric nanomaterials.  Thermoelectrics are attractive for use in heating
    or cooling systems without moving parts or the use of greenhouse gases, and for
    generating electricity from waste heat, e.g., from vehicle exhausts and factories.
    \ The low efficiency (measured by ZT) of presently used thermoelectric materials
    limits their use in emerging applications. A recently developed method provides
    a way for obtaining bulk thermoelectric nanomaterials of both p- and n-type with
    25% higher ZT, through a combination of chemical doping and nanostructuring. The
    objective of this project is to scale up this method to obtain kilogram quantities
    of pnictogen chalcogenides with ZT ~ 1.  Our materials synthesis and processing
    scale up efforts will be guided by thermoelectric property measurements and materials
    characterization. The structure-processing-property correlations unearthed during
    our studies will identify the synthesis and processing parameters needed to retain
    the high ZT during scale-up, and will provide clues to further increase ZT (e.g.,
    to 1.5). The scaled-up process will serve as a basis for expanding the range of
    application of thermoelectric materials for applications in high-efficiency refrigeration
    and heat harvesting. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project
    will be to unlock and access the multi-billion dollar potential of thermoelectrics
    for transforming solid-state cooling and heat harvesting.  The project findings
    will be applicable to multiple materials systems that can be used for either solid-state
    cooling or power generation.  Thermoelectric materials already represent a billion-dollar
    industry, but have the potential to access a market several times larger, if the
    conversion efficiency is increased by a factor of two.  The project will scale-up
    a nanomaterials manufacturing technology targeted to create new high efficiency
    solid-state cooling devices that can replace the current refrigeration and air-conditioning
    technologies based on environmentally unfriendly gases, and create high-efficiency
    electricity generators from waste heat, significantly expanding the thermoelectric
    markets and impacting global energy usage and addressing global environmental
    concerns.  This project will also lead to introduction of a new class of nanomaterials
    with superior properties to those available currently in the marketplace. The
    project is anticipated to create at least 10-20 jobs in the near-term, and will
    position New York state and the United States as global leaders in thermoelectrics

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the availability of an additive manufacturing (3D printing) process suitable for full-scale building construction. The construction industry represents a critical nexus in the American economy. Building construction impacts nearly every economic sector, particularly manufacturing, transportation, energy, consumer products and appliances, and real estate. Simply, a building is perhaps the most essential economic stimulus there is. Yet, the practice of building has seen little of the technological revolution that has transformed virtually every other industry. As a result, the construction industry produces significant material and financial waste, and its productivity has steadily declined over the past several decades. Additive manufacturing is the most efficient and cost-effective approach to creating custom products, of which buildings are by far the most valuable and most widely purchased. Customization is increasingly driving demand by today?s consumers. Additive manufacturing in construction could reduce costs and material waste while providing unparalleled design freedom and driving innovation through the consolidation of many isolated industrial activities into one highly flexible and efficient manufacturing process, which directly serves industry professionals and clients at an individual level.

    The intellectual merit of this project stems from the vast potential of Additive Manufacturing to transform design and making. In a broad sense, the proposed method of construction aims to make the complexity, efficiency, and freedom of digital architectural design accessible to the average consumer. Phase I research will serve to scale and develop a new large-scale additive manufacturing process, and to evaluate the performance of the physical products in their functions as building components. The proposed method may potentially impact other types of large-scale manufacturing as well, including aerospace and automotive. Our technology is rooted in observations of the processes in which forms are created in the natural world. Structures in nature have long fascinated scientists and engineers, due to their remarkable efficiency and complex forms. 3D printing now allows us to manufacture products of similar efficiency and complexity which reflect our observations of nature. We believe that if the genius of natural organisms can be applied to the way we create shelter, provide transportation, design infrastructure, or construct cities, the resulting innovations could profoundly, and very literally, shape the way our societies develop, and transform our relationship with the natural world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of a high-brightness ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UVLED) system for inducing an involuntary avoidance response of birds and bats.  The purpose of this system is to reduce the mortality rates of birds and bats by deterring them from entering the active rotor zone area of an operating wind turbine and thus minimizing the risk of mortality or injury from direct collision or barotrauma.  Many avian and bat species have spectral sensitivity to ultraviolet light and are known to react to signal colors and bright light sources, whereas humans do not have spectral sensitivity to ultraviolet light and would not have an overall awareness to the operation of a UVLED system.  Strict regulations for species protection by the Endangered Species Act as well as general bird and bat mortality are guiding the permitting approval process for siting new wind farms (both on land and off-shore) and the operations of existing wind farms.

    The broader/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses a major problem affecting the permitting of new and existing wind farms.  In addition, there are other numerous additional potential applications for the UVLED system.  These applications include protecting airports? landing and take-off airspaces from bird strikes; integrating UVLEDs into airplane landing lights to protect against bird strikes; mounting on radio/TV and other towers to minimize bird mortality; mounting on large buildings where bird mortality is known to be high; protecting tar pits and similar hazards from bird mortality; and protecting bridges, rooftops, and similar spaces from the nuisance of bird droppings.  Also, bats save farmers about $74 per acre by providing natural pest control.  Pest control services provided by insect-eating bats in the U.S. likely save the U.S. agricultural industry at least $3 billion a year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project of ?No Heat Spray Drying? fundamentally changes the process of spray drying liquids to powders by eliminating the use of heat.  Typically, a liquid emulsion consists of a high value liquid ingredient that is emulsified with a carrier system that when dried captures the liquid ingredient in a powdered form.  High temperature spray drying remains the preferred method of drying many thermally sensitive materials such as foods, chemicals, probiotics, pharmaceuticals, and in many other applications where the production of a free-flowing powder is required.  The current spray drying process employs air heated up to 400° Fahrenheit to dry the liquid into a powder.  Exposing sensitive, volatile liquid ingredients to high temperatures causes molecular degradation that negatively impacts performance.  By eliminating the use of heat the end result is a significantly improved powder in terms of product quality, solubility, stability and overall performance.  Our research will be focused on improving our proprietary technology through dryer optimization and atomization development.  This research should yield an innovative, commercially viable ?no heat? spray drying technology with the ability to manufacture significant amounts of powdered products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans markets including food & beverage, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, infant formula, coffee, vitamins and numerous other segments where the production of a free flowing powder ingredient is desired.  The challenge:  how to eliminate the use of heat in converting liquids to powders.  By eliminating the use of heat in the manufacturing process, we create significantly improved powder products.  Our process is more economical, delivers products with longer shelf life, better encapsulation and improves solubility. Our technology has several societal benefits including decreasing energy consumption and preventing the evaporation of volatile ingredients into the atmosphere.  Our technology may be able impact the bioavailability of drugs, decrease tablet sizes, deliver stable Omega 3 ingredients and improve dried milk powder.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly increasing the ways supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries are used today.  Supercapacitors offer very high power capabilities and high energy efficiency and have been used in many renewable energy applications such as hybrid buses and wind turbines.  Currently, their use is limited due to high cost and low energy density relative to Li-ion batteries.  Coulometrics has developed a proprietary process that can modify low cost activated carbon materials into supercapacitor grade carbons with 25% higher energy density and twice the current lifespan of existing materials.   These critical developments will lower the overall system cost and improve cell life allowing for more widespread use of supercapacitors in renewable energy applications.  Coulometrics has also shown that a very similar process can be used to convert natural graphite to lithium ion grade anode materials with higher energy density and significantly lower cost.  This process will also enable a Northern American company to become the first producer of graphite for lithium ion batteries on the continent which can significantly reduce lithium ion battery cost for applications such as electric vehicles.   Both projects will have additional environmental benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less burning of fossil fuels, and help protect the environment.



    The project seeks to break through a significant barrier that has kept ultracapacitor voltage and energy density stagnant for over a decade and significantly reduce costs of lithium ion battery carbon materials.  Supercapacitor companies all produce products with different carbons, electrolytes, cell construction, etc. and yet are all confined to the same performance specifications. We believe that this is related to oxidation/reduction reactions that occur on the carbon surface; a fairly intuitive hypothesis; however attempts at solutions have been futile. The surface treatment we developed in Phase I has resulted in a reduction of these oxidation/reduction currents by more than 50%. This technology will lead to the largest performance gains in the ultracapacitor industry in over 10 years.  Additionally, one of the most challenging factors limiting market growth for ultracapacitors is their high cost, of which activated carbon accounts for 27%. Coulometrics' treatment applied to inexpensive water filtration carbon, also developed in Phase I, has shown very similar performance enhancements, and will cost up to 95% less than commercial activated carbon materials.  The surface modification process for graphitic carbons will enable the low cost and high quality production of carbon anode materials for lithium ion batteries based on natural graphite.  This breakthrough can significantly reduce lithium ion battery cost which is a key element for more wide spread adoption of electric vehicles which will help reduce our nation's dependence on the need to import foreign oil.

    to solve the problems of limited voltage, energy density, and lifetime in Electric
    Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs). These issues have largely lead to the failure
    of EDLCs to become a significant part of the energy storage landscape. Over the
    years, many different efforts have focused on developing new carbon materials
    for EDLCs, including those focused on exotic and expensive materials such as carbon
    nanotubes, carbide derived carbons and Graphene.  None of these have so far succeeded
    at matching the energy density, lifetime, or voltage range of 15 year old commercial
    carbon materials. This project will attempt to prove that this is related to functional
    groups on the carbon surface that, when assembled in an EDLC and charged, are
    REDOX active to form water in the electrolyte. The objective of the research will
    be to eliminate these species and other surface functional groups, while maintaining
    the exceptionally high surface area necessary for high capacitance, through precisely
    controlled thermal treatment of activated carbon.  This will result in dramatic
    increases in the voltage, energy density, and life of current EDLC products. \n\nThe
    broader impact/commercial potential of this project will involve dramatically
    expanding the value of ultracapacitors to various applications and enhancing their
    societal impact. Supercapacitors have failed to meet expectations for market growth
    largely due to high cost, premature failure, low voltage (matching Li-ion battery
    voltages requires two devices in series) and low energy density, and have seen
    minimal technical progress over the last decade. Our technology would increase
    the energy density, lifetime and voltage to levels that would enable much more
    widespread adoption in applications currently restricted to batteries alone.  Additional
    societal impact, and directly related commercial advantage, would stem from the
    fact that this technology could eliminate the requirement for exotic and expensive
    precursors for carbon production, allowing, for the first time, the use of inexpensive
    water filtration carbons. The combined lower cost and improved performance would
    expand EDLCs use in applications like hybrid cars, buses, wind turbine pitch control
    and grid storage, all of which have tremendous societal impact and where cost
    is the primary barrier to entry for EDLC manufacturers."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel soft magnetic material and fabrication process for magnetic circuits of electric machines, such as winding cores of electric motors. The technology utilizes a unique single-step near net-shape fabrication process based on metal spray deposition to produce an isotropic metal microstructure characterized by small domains with high permeability, high saturation and low coercivity with a controlled formation of insulation boundaries that limit electric conductivity between neighboring domains. The resulting material provides an excellent three-dimensional magnetic path while minimizing energy losses associated with eddy currents. It can replace anisotropic laminated winding cores, which currently constrain the design of conventional electric motors to geometries with two-dimensional magnetic paths. As a further objective of the project, a new hybrid-field motor topology, with three-dimensional magnetic paths enabled by the proposed material and fabrication process, is being developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable production of electric motors with improved performance and efficiency while reducing cost and material scrap associated with manufacturing of motor winding cores. Electric motors are used extensively in a growing number of applications, including robotics, semiconductor and LED process equipment, industrial automation, electric vehicles, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, appliances, power tools, medical devices, and military and space exploration applications.  These markets drive an increasing demand for electric motors with improved performance, higher efficiency, and lower cost. Considering the extensive use of electric motors globally, the disruptive change resulting from the proposed hybrid-field motor technology with spray-formed winding cores is expected to provide significant commercial, societal and environmental benefits, including improved manufacturing efficiency, waste reduction, and energy conservation.

    Hybrid-Field Electric Machines'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel soft magnetic material for electric motor cores, a fabrication process to make components from the material, and an electric motor configuration leveraging the benefits of the material and fabrication process. The approach is to utilize a new single-step net-shape fabrication technique based on uniform-droplet spray deposition in a reactive atmosphere to produce an isotropic metal microstructure characterized by small domains of high permeability and low coercivity with a controlled formation of insulation boundaries that limit electrical conductivity between neighboring domains.  This design is expected to provide a superior magnetic path while minimizing losses due to eddy currents, and eliminating design constraints associated with anisotropic laminated cores of conventional motors.

    The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide spray-formed winding cores for hybrid-field motors to increase output, improve efficiency and reduce material scrap during fabrication, thus lowering the cost of electric motors. Considering the extensive use of electric motors in numerous applications, including industrial machinery and automation, robotics, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, appliances, power tools, medical devices, automotive applications, electric vehicles, military equipment etc., there is an increasing need for electric motors with improved performance, higher efficiency, and lower cost. This project is expected to have a significant commercial and environmental impact by providing low-cost and high-efficiency electric motor cores.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a hydraulic regenerative shock absorber and charge system for hybrid trucks. An appreciable amount of energy is lost in a typical suspension as heat, especially in heavy vehicles. Existing technologies have been unable to efficiently capture this energy in a cost-effective manner. This project will entail the modeling, design, fabrication, and testing of a hydraulic-electric energy harvesting unit, along with the power electronics and energy storage subsystem to charge hybrid truck batteries. The objective of the project is to study and prove the feasibility of a regenerative shock absorber as a disruptive hydraulic energy harvesting mechanism on heavy trucks. Emphasis will be on the specific challenges of converting high force small amplitude oscillations into electricity that can interface with hybrid charge systems. Work will focus on a proof-of-concept demonstration and a determination of the increased efficiency possible on a hybrid vehicle using the internal piston/integrated-generator regenerative shock absorber mechanism.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant as the foundational technology can be applied to a wide range of vehicles, systems and industrial applications in diverse industries. The technology has the potential to save millions of dollars per year in fuel for fleet operators, and simultaneously reduce carbon emissions across the United States. Hybrid vehicles traditionally have a single energy regeneration source (braking) to charge batteries. Effectively incorporating a secondary regenerative charge system may open doors to many new regenerative technologies that work in unison to charge hybrid vehicle batteries, thus allowing for significant reductions in waste energy. The market potential for the technology is considerable, and includes trucks, military vehicles, transit buses, passenger vehicles, and rail. When incorporated into conventional non-hybrid platforms, the technology can improve fuel economy by displacing alternator load. In addition to vehicular applications, the research may, on a broader scale, lead to enabling technologies for compact, sealed, and efficient hydraulic actuators and energy harvesters. This will have applications in other fields such as aviation, industrial machinery, and robotics.

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is expected to be realized in two principal areas. There have been extensive efforts to mask hydraulic noise, but the proposed effort is directed at eliminating the hydraulic ripple before it is created at the source. Traditional passive methods of masking noise are insufficient because they work effectively only in a limited operating range. This is inadequate because hydraulic systems typically must operate over a wide range of speed and loads. First this project is expected to make hydraulic active suspension systems quieter, more responsive and robust and, therefore, more readily and widely adopted by industry. The resulting likely increased use of active suspension systems will, therefore, have the added societal benefit of improved vehicle safety and comfort. This project is also expected to have a much wider impact on the hydraulic noise that has been a chronic pain point for the hydraulics industry for decades. It will allow for the manufacture of quieter and more durable hydraulic pumps for many applications beyond active suspension.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an investigation of the feasibility of using an active buffer to eliminate flow ripple from a hydraulic pump, such as a gerotor pump. In a representative hydraulic system, the gerotor pump is at the heart of an advanced electro-hydraulic, active suspension actuator. Due to their geometry, positive displacement pumps provide small fluctuations in their fluid flow rate at a constant pump RPM. These small changes in flow rate create pressure fluctuations that can create significant mechanical movement that results in objectionable or unhealthy noise. The proposed effort is directed specifically at mitigating acoustic and structural vibration noise caused by such a pump. The proposed effort will utilize a combination of advanced experimental and computer simulation techniques to demonstrate the viability of the approach in the representative hydraulic system (an active suspension actuator). Hydraulic system noise is a widespread pain point in numerous applications involving hydraulic pumps. A key difficulty with hydraulic pumps is that they are often required to perform over a wide range of speeds and pressures. Conventional noise control devices typically can only be optimized for a relatively narrow portion of this range.

    test the efficacy of high-volume scaled microorganisms with the ability to induce
    cementation for masonry applications using methods proven at laboratory scale.
    Sporosarcina Pasteurii, a common non-pathogenic soil bacterium, has the ability
    to induce the creation of a biocement material, fusing loose grains of aggregate.
    Mineral growth fills gaps between the aggregate grains, biocementing the particles
    together in a structural bond, a process that takes a few days or less. The resulting
    material has a composition and demonstrates physical properties similar to natural
    sandstone. Traditional masonry manufacturing is reliant upon expensive fuel sources
    for hardening the final product, and these represent a large percentage of total
    manufacturing costs.  Biocementation at ambient conditions as a method for binding
    material into masonry units allows a cost advantage by eliminating the need for
    firing the final product.  The objectives of this effort include an extension
    of the baseline fermentation process for microorganism scale-up, testing of the
    efficacy of cell recovery, and efficiacy testing of the full-scale masonry product.
    \ This research will also focus on testing the process efficacy with inexpensive
    industrial media in conjunction with high-volume fermentation and recovery practices.
    \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the demonstration
    of the commercial viability of an optimized production process for masonry units
    (bricks) based on biocementation.   Over 80% of global construction uses masonry.
    Masonry manufacturing is a $24 billion business in the US. According to the Carbon
    War Room, 1.23 trillion fired bricks are manufactured globally each year, emitting
    over 800 million tons of carbon emissions.  Due to increased regulations introduced
    by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), several masonry companies have had
    to either shut down or invest significant sums in cleaner production methods due
    to these associated emissions. Government incentives for green construction, compounded
    with increasing sustainability concerns - for example, end users such as architects,
    are specifying the use of more sustainable materials - have created an opportunity
    for the adoption of \"greener\" cementitious materials. The societal impacts of
    this research will include a significant reduction of carbon emissions and the
    addition of manufacturing jobs in the US. Biocementation has also been investigated
    for use in soil stabilization and mine recovery. This project will enhance the
    technological understanding of this process, will help to establish commercial
    viability, and will generate additional practical data including durability and

    This Small Innovation Research Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the Raman Force Microscope (RFM) to provide a new metrology tool for in situ topographic, strain, and chemical analysis with nanometer spatial resolution.  Feature size reduction in the semiconductor industry requires that metrology methods must routinely measure properties down to the atomic scale.  Novel materials and geometries add to the complexity of measurements. RFM technology is a combination of Raman microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), where an AFM tip provides a nanometer scale light source to generate stimulated Raman scattering, and at the same time measures the force gradient arising from the Raman scattering. The use of the AFM tip as the Raman scattering detector significantly simplifies Raman signal acquisition and system configuration.  By combining a high-speed AFM scheme, this technology allows for in-line characterization of physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials and structures in the manufacturing environment, i.e. stress in the channel layer and chemical characterization defects. The objectives of the proposed Phase I study are (1) to demonstrate reflection mode RFM for Raman signal measurement of Si wafers and (2) to demonstrate measurement of stress-induced Raman shifts in nanometer-sized features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt not only in the semiconductor industry but across many disciplines and industries, both in academia and industry.  RFM can be used to measure and characterize a wide variety of nanoscale materials and structures, e.g. high- and low-k dielectric films and other emerging materials (such as graphene) used in advanced semiconductor processes. It can be also widely used across disciplines, e.g. for the measurement of nanoparticle homogeneity or optimization of self-assembled monolayers in surface chemistry. The RFM technique also has the capability to image individual biomolecules in situ, such as for the real-time monitoring of membrane protein dynamics on cells, which will provide unprecedented utility in biomedical and clinical research.  A reliable label-free imaging tool with the capability to identify chemical bond information at the molecular level will potentially bring about revolutionary advances in many fields of basic and applied biological science, including drug discovery, proteomics, structural biology, and personalized medicine.  The RFM technique will be simpler to implement as compared to other hybrid instruments involving high resolution microscopy, resulting in an affordable instrument for academic and research institutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the development of end user-moldable advanced polyimine composite inputs for the athletic protective gear market (which is valued at $16.6 billion). Currently, plastic products must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines are easily and economically recyclable. The total U.S. composite materials market is a $30 billion market, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high industrial temperatures of between 400 and 600 deg. F. Polyimine polymers are moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase I research project will include developing end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of ¼ inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. Material testing and mechanical characterization will relate to testing requirements arising from composite prototype development including but not limited to: delamination, fiber-dependent moldability, fiber-dependent flex, fiber-dependent tensile, fiber/resin-dependent pass-through impact force, and failure analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a novel approach, based on holographic video microscopy, to analyze the physical properties of colloidal dispersions. This technology will have immediate applications in industries as diverse as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, personal care products, petrochemicals and food, all of which rely on the properties of colloidal dispersions and the microscopic particles from which they are composed. The worldwide market for particle characterization exceeded $5 billion per year in 2012. The present effort's holographic characterization technology extends the state-of-the-art in particle characterization by providing simultaneous information about both the size and the composition of individual particles in dispersion, and by building up a clear picture of the distribution of properties within a sample without relying on models or assumptions. Access to these new dimensions of information will be useful for product development, process control and quality assurance in all of the industrial sectors that rely on the properties of colloidal materials, thereby increasing opportunities for innovation, enhancing product performance, and decreasing manufacturing costs. In addition to capturing a share of the established market for particle characterization, this new product may also broaden the market by creating new application areas.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in transforming holographic video microscopy from an academic research tool to a powerful commercial instrument.  Several innovations are required to make this revolutionary technology commercially viable. In its present incarnation, holographic characterization has been demonstrated with nearly ideal spheres, for which it yields the size to within a nanometer, the complex refractive index to within a part per thousand, and the time-resolved trajectory to within a nanometer in three dimensions. No other particle characterization technique offers such a wealth of particle-resolved information. This Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of holographic particle characterization for a range of non-ideal industrial materials by applying state-of-the-art methods of machine learning to extend the technique's domain of applicability while simultaneously reducing the time per analysis from seconds to tens of milliseconds. This 100-fold acceleration, and the associated reduction in computational cost, will enable the technology to be deployed in large-volume and high-throughput applications. The resulting real-time insights into colloidal dispersions' compositions will improve manufacturing efficiency by identifying and helping to correct process deviations and failures.  In so doing it will reduce product costs in all of the industrial sectors that develop and sell colloidal materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel low-cost, high-performance fabric suitable for long service life helium inflatable structures, including aerostats and airships. Traditional fabrics for lighter-than-air (LTA) applications utilize woven polyester or vectran basecloths laminated with various materials that improve gas retention, environmental resistance and allow the material to be thermally bonded. This combination has excellent performance, providing a useful service life in excess of seven years, but comes at a high cost, which limits the commercial application of helium inflatable structures. The proposed low-cost, high performance fabric replaces the woven basecloth with a scrim of high-strength synthetic fibers, similar to those in high-end sailcloth. This type of material has not seen wide use in helium inflatable structures where seams are subject to long-term loading from internal pressure. The impact of scrim pattern and yarn alignment on seam stiffness and long-term holding strength is considered. This Phase I research will investigate the behavior of these materials, as well as one or more alternative woven fabrics, under long-term loading, UV exposure, and mechanical wear and tear, in order to evaluate their suitability for helium inflatables.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a step toward the widespread commercialization of LTA inflatable structures in traditional and new application areas. Helium inflatable structures are traditionally used for transporting or elevating high value payloads, such as military surveillance equipment or advertising, where the relatively high cost of the fabric envelope is not a barrier to commercial feasibility. The advent of a low-cost, high performance helium inflatable fabric will make LTA structures economically viable for a number of industries that are cost-sensitive, including remote and emergency wireless communication; low-cost freight transport; and airborne wind energy production. The research will also enhance the understanding of the behavior of scrim-based fabrics under loading conditions, which may benefit a wide range of industries that could use these fabrics, including sailing, architectural fabrics and air inflatable structures.

    focus on the development of a superior infrastructure material with wide-reaching
    applications.  Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar materials offer significant
    performance advantages as compared to uncoated steel rebar.  These advantages
    include a sevenfold weight reduction, the elimination of corrosion, a 30% reduction
    in concrete usage (which translates to a 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions),
    and equivalent tensile strength at smaller diameters versus traditional steel
    rebar.  FRP rebar is being produced in small quantities, but has limited market
    acceptance due to its high cost.  The material and process to be developed will
    allow price parity and enable dramatic improvements in production speeds as compared
    to the current FRP state-of-the-art.  When combined, these improvements will open
    the FRP market of $1.8 billion and create opportunities in the broader $60 billion
    global market for rebar.  Additionally, global basalt mine waste dumps will be
    explored and, if possible, utilized as a raw material for fiber production.  If
    successful, this would eliminate a significant waste stream and lead to better
    environmental stewardship. \n\nThis effort will focus on developing the process
    required to produce this new rebar.  A thermoset resin and basalt fiber will be
    used as the primary reinforcements within this composite.  Over the past 20 years,
    FRP rebar has been developed into a viable product, representing $1.2 billion
    in cumulative revenue.  However, no FRP rebar product is currently offered at
    price parity with uncoated steel rebar.  In order to reach price parity, this
    effort will focus on development of a novel high-speed manufacturing process for
    this material.  Basalt fiber is an emerging material that has potential to replace
    carbon fiber in a variety of applications.  Additionally, thermoset resins not
    commonly used in pultrusion can offer improved performance characteristics that
    cannot be achieved with typical FRP rebar resins.  Completion of this project
    will create further understanding of material interactions in this system, which
    will create the potential for additional composite technologies."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of the amino acid, L-Threonine. Currently, engineered microbes bear mutations that increase the production of Threonine of interest by inhibiting the cell?s ability to produce other amino acids. These mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell?s metabolic flux toward Threonine, thereby boosting production efficiency and easing downstream purification. Unfortunately, these mutations also decrease cellular fitness and, thus, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to direct metabolic flux toward Threonine production in the absence of costly media supplementation. The project has 3 key objectives: 1) generate E. coli strains containing off-pathway metabolic enzymes tagged for degradation by a growth-phase dependent proteolysis system, 2) test the ability of these strains to grow on supplement-free media, and 3) assay for production of Threonine by these engineered strains. We anticipate that our engineered strains will grow robustly on minimal, un-supplemented media. Upon induction of our proteolysis system, we expect our strains to specifically eliminate off-target metabolic pathways, leading to a substantial increase in production of our target product, Threonine.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the generation of more cost-efficient L-Threonine producing microbial strains. Purified amino acids are estimated to constitute a U.S. market of $1.30 billion by 2013. These chemicals are used as animal feedstock supplements, precursors in production of the artificial sweetener aspartame, and have potential as biofuel precursors. Currently, key amino acids are produced commercially using highly engineered microbes that convert low-cost sugar sources (e.g. glucose) to the final amino acid product. To improve the conversion efficiency and ease downstream purification, the microbe?s ability to synthesize other, off-pathway amino acids is often eliminated.  However, because these other amino acids are critical for bacterial growth, they must be added as a supplement to the growth medium, substantially increasing production costs.  The technology proposed here would allow for efficient, robust production of easily purified amino acids without the need for media supplementation, dramatically reducing production costs. Moreover, the regulated degradation technology developed herein will provide next-generation regulatory tools for other industrial metabolic engineering applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to produce microbes capable of cost-effective production of amino acids used as animal feed supplements.  Technical research herein will test the feasibility of applying cutting edge synthetic biology and metabolic engineering techniques to develop engineered strains capable of sustainable and cost-effective production of purified animal feed supplements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a reliable, sustainable and safe source of animal feed supplements using biotechnology. Many plant-based animals feeds, such as those based on maize, are deficient in key nutrients needed for growth. To improve feed efficiency and animal growth rates, these deficiencies have been historically overcome with supplementation with animal waste or protein-rich plant products including soy. Recent BSE (Mad Cow Disease) outbreaks combined with dioxine toxicity (from supplementation with fish products) however, have discouraged the use of animal products. Further, supplementation with soy supplies excess, unnecessary amino acids that the animals excrete as nitrogen-rich waste, a significant environmental pollutant. Feed supplementation using purified amino acids produced via biotechnology offers a superior approach from a safety and environmental sustainability perspective.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to produce low-cost and customizable aromas that are inspired by plant extracts.  The fragrance industry uses fragrant extracts from flowers and other plant materials as basic building blocks for haute-couture finished fragrances. These extracts are expensive due to the limited availability of suitable plant materials, and due to the fact that the extracts are too complicated to replicate by mixing pure chemicals. This project will generate novel fragrance blends via fermentation ("cultured aromas"). These cultured aromas will be customized for the exacting requirements of professional perfumers, offering a degree of creativity that does not exist with plant extracts. This technology will present a disruptive entry into the multi-billion dollar market for finished fragrances. Beyond fragrances, this technology will allow the development of new customizable extracts with the beneficial properties of plant extracts, including flavors, dyes, and antioxidant activity.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to apply advanced synthetic biology tools to produce sustainable alternatives to complex plant extracts. Conventional metabolic engineering projects focus on the optimized production of a single target compound; this project instead will engineer microbial strains that produce a range of components found in high-value plant extracts used in the fragrance industry. The goal is to rapidly screen and characterize novel plant enzymes for use in conjunction with existing strains that produce key fragrance molecules. These novel enzymes are expected to produce multiple fragrance molecules and the profile of the resulting blends will be compared to those derived from plants via high throughput metabolomics. The cultured aroma blends can then be customized to a perfumers' specification by tuning the biosynthetic pathways.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a set of novel, versatile measurement tools for use during fermentation and scale-up in metabolic engineering. The tools will be based on the production of odorants and enable real-time time monitoring of gene expression levels during fermentation. Metabolic engineering holds great promise for enabling a range of important applications including cellulosic biofuels, therapeutics production, and bio-based, environmentally-friendly chemical manufacturing. But any such project requires that an engineered organism expressing the relevant biosynthetic pathway be scaled up from lab-sized cultures to large-scale commercial fermentation. This is not a straightforward task, and is different for every project, because the fermentation conditions required for each engineered strain are different. The new measurement tools will enable more detailed quantification of cell state during fermentation so that strain and pathway optimization is more informed.

    The broader impacts of this research are to enable more informed strain optimization for large-scale fermentation thereby reducing R&D costs for the bio-based manufacturing industry. With the growing interest in clean technology and alternatives to petroleum-based manufacturing, many new companies and existing companies are moving into the bioengineering and biomanufacturing industries. However, all of these companies face a common hurdle of scaling up production of their fuel, specialty chemical or biomaterial to commercial scale. The companies spend significant R&D money and time optimizing pathway yield during fermentation. For example, Dupont took 7 years and $400M to scale-up microbial production of 1,3-propanediol.  Jay Keasling, a founder of Amyris Biotechnologies, a leading synthetic biology company, reported that Amyris spends 95% of their time trying to find and eliminate unintended interactions between components in their engineered metabolic pathways. Reducing the R&D costs in the biofuels and industrial biotechnology industries would open up new application areas to environmentally-friendly, bio-based production solutions.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an alternative to the use of
    antibiotics in agricultural and companion animals.  It has recently been demonstrated
    that the practice of feeding antibiotics to livestock is correlated with the emergence
    of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria that infect humans.  For this reason,
    the FDA has recently introduced a voluntary plan to phase out the use of antibiotics
    in animals.  However, antibiotic use to protect animal health and to promote weight
    gain is widespread in the livestock industry, and a viable and non-harmful alternative
    is needed. The proposed technology will allow livestock growers to protect their
    animals and promote weight gain by feeding edible green algae that have been engineered
    to produce colostrum proteins.  Colostrum proteins are thought to have the same
    protective effects as antibiotics without the negative side effect of producing
    antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Production of these colostrum proteins in green
    algae allows for efficient bio-manufacturing, which will meet the scale required
    to supply livestock producers with a cost effective source of colostrum.  Sales
    of antibiotics for animal health and weight gain are in the billions of dollars
    each year, and this new approach has the potential to garner a significant share
    of that market as the industry shifts away from the use of antibiotics. \n\n\nThis
    SBIR project proposes to develop genetically engineered strains of green algae,
    Chlamydomomas reinhardtii, that produce colostrum proteins.  Colostrum proteins
    are normally ingested into the digestive tract where they exhibit anti-microbial
    properties. C. reinhardtii has been shown to have the necessary cellular machinery
    to produce a wide range of complex proteins including monoclonal antibodies, hormones,
    and others.  The goal is to produce several key colostrum proteins in C. reinhardtii
    that will be fed to livestock as a replacement for antibiotics, and be included
    in companion animal diets.  The proposed research will demonstrate that colostrum
    proteins produced in algae are bioactive, and will function in the same manner
    as their natural counterparts.  Additionally, the research will produce a media
    in which to grow edible algae that is safe for animal consumption and promotes
    the expression of the colostrum protein of interest.  Finally, the research will
    demonstrate that algal expressed colostrum proteins have a beneficial effect on
    animal health and growth promotion. Together, this research will help demonstrate
    the feasibility of using algal-expressed colostrum proteins as a replacement for
    antibiotic use in livestock feeds and promotion of pet health in pet food."

    research and next-generation clinical treatments:  Delivering materials into cells.
    Cells are the basic functional unit of the body yet understanding their role in
    disease and harnessing their inherent potential to combat ailments has been limited
    by our inability to deliver material to their cytoplasm. By facilitating access
    to a cell's interior one could enable rapid progress in the ability to probe intracellular
    processes and engineer cell function for therapeutic purposes. This project aims
    to further develop a promising new concept of intracellular delivery capable of
    overcoming many conventional barriers associated with the current state-of-the-art.
    The platform will potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutics
    based on a deeper understanding of cell function and a more robust ability to
    engineer cell fate. Indeed, addressing such a fundamental challenge in the biomedical
    field would provide substantial benefits to society and could impact numerous
    commercial opportunities. Potential applications include basic research, high-throughput
    drug discovery screening, and cell-based therapies to treat cancer immunotherapies.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a vector-free microfluidic platform
    for intracellular delivery of biomolecules in order to increase efficacy, and
    improve ease-of-use. The platform uses a novel method based on rapid, transient
    deformation of cells (\"cell squeezing\") as they pass through a microfluidic
    constriction. The squeezing process causes temporary disruption of the cell membrane
    and facilitates passive transport of target delivery materials into the cytoplasm.
    The proposed work aims to introduce automated, closed-loop control of key parameters
    (pressure, temperature, and flow rate) that govern the delivery process. These
    additions will allow users to precisely tune the amount of material delivered
    to cells and the resultant viability. By developing this hardware, the technology
    will be well-positioned for increased adoption and commercialization by the end
    of Phase I. The proposed hardware controllers will be verified and validated through
    relevant studies using primary immune cells, a disease-relevant subset of cells
    that are recalcitrant to existing delivery methods. Finally, the proposed work
    would facilitate the launch of a robust prototype system for early-stage testing
    in high-impact applications."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes
    to develop a contact lens for the treatment of dry eye disease, which affects
    more than 6 million people in the United States. The contact lens is designed
    to be placed on the surface of the eye to relieve symptoms of pain and irritation
    associated with ocular dryness. There is no device currently on the market with
    this design and function, and the objectives of this research are to refine and
    characterize the lens as well as to test the safety and efficacy of the device
    in animal studies.  Ultimately, this research will enable efficacy studies in
    humans.   \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project
    is the potential to improve treatment of dry eye disease.  The cost of treating
    dry eye disease in the United States is $2 billion dollars annually, despite the
    relative ineffectiveness of current therapies. Not only will this device improve
    the quality of life of millions of people, but it will also validate the use of
    our unique material/design for medical devices in general, which may have a much
    broader application. This device represents one of very few non-pharmaceutical
    therapies for dry eye disease, and, therefore, has the potential to broaden the
    thinking of the scientific community with regard to methods of dry eye treatment."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a first-in-class Predictive Phenotypic Profiler (PPP) software tool that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-clinical drug discovery process. A recent study of drugs approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2008 shows that a majority of first-in-class drugs are now derived from phenotypic screens rather than traditional target-based screens. However, there is currently a severe lack of computational and data tools that can bridge the vast amounts of traditional molecular-based data with the equally vast amounts of phenotypic data now being generated. The PPP tool integrates and interprets this complex and multi-faceted data to greatly enhance the ability of pharmaceutical companies to find new and effective drugs. The estimated cost per new prescription drug approval is $2.56 billion - the economic impact of reducing the pre-clinical drug discovery process by just one week is estimated to result in a $108 million cost savings for the pharmaceutical industry, creating a large financial opportunity. This tool aims to enhance the number and quality of drugs that enter clinical trials, resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a proof-of-concept PPP software tool that brings together a variety of publicly available molecular and phenotypic data sources into a graphical user interface, allowing for the discovery of novel mechanisms of action, and the identification of target(s) from phenotypic assays. The major hurdles of this project will be the integration of these highly heterogeneous datasets and the identification of evidence based path patterns. Semantic technologies and domain expertise will be applied to this application to surmount these data integration and prediction challenges. The plan to reach the goal of a prototype PPP tool includes:  1) Creating a semantic graph for phenotypic data sources, 2) finding evidence-based path patterns in phenotypic data, 3) applying predictive algorithms for phenotypic data analysis, and 4) developing a graphical user interface for evaluation and verification. Phase I success will result in a tool that can be used by pharmaceutical companies for evaluation and product feedback.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project creates GeniStress Responder. GeniStress Responder is part of EkaTox, a family of toxicology diagnostics harnessing the power of comparative genomics in nematodes to make toxicology predictions in humans. GeniStress Responder identifies and characterizes mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds (genotoxins) using bioengineered nematodes. Multiple types of bioengineered nematodes are created and arranged into a GeniStress Responder panel. The panel's bioengineered nematodes become biosensors of genotoxic activity. Each biosensor works by using a specific genotoxin-sensitive gene to drive expression of a fluorescent-protein coding sequence. Exposure to a specific genotoxin elicits a specific pattern of activity in the GeniStress Responder panel. Feasibility is demonstrated when known genotoxins create specific toxicogenomic responses in the GeniStress Responder panel.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this research are introduction of improved genotoxicity diagnostics in the marketplace. Current technologies are inadequate. No single test is available to comprehensively profile different types of sample genotoxicity. The market needs an easy-to-use test for genotoxicity profiling. GeniStress Responder fills the market need for genotoxicity profiling in one simple diagnostic kit. With GeniStress Responder, a toxic compound's mechanism-of-action is determined in a shorter time and with fewer resources, than what can be achieved with current technology. GeniStress Responder's ease-of-use will accelerate drug discovery (cancer therapeutics) and environmental toxicology testing (cosmetics, plastics, super-fund site cleanup).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a platform for the discovery of new anthelmintic (anti-parasite) drugs.  Drug resistance is occurring with all anthelmintics currently on the market.  Current drug development only introduces new molecules to the existing drug targets.  As a result, drug resistance quickly jumps to these new drugs, which makes them ineffective shortly after market introduction.  Without an adequate source of effective anthelmintics, livestock yields, crop damage, and human capital are starting to suffer. The social burden is creating economic losses totaling hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide.  By focusing on a novel drug target that controls entry into infective life forms, this proposal aims to generate a new class of anthelmintics to combat this growing problem. The drug companies that commercialize this potential new class of anthelmintics will access a market potential of $1.5 B per year or more.

    The SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a platform for the discovery of new anthelmintic drugs using genetically engineered nematods (C. elegans).  The approach used will insert a segment of a parasite gene in replacement of a segment of a native gene.  The resulting chimera gene converts the C. elegans nematode into a form that better mimics the parasite state.  Drug hits found active on the chimera-expressing nematode are then refined into leads by testing for efficacy against parasite infection model.  The proposal's chimera platform is adapted to a diverse set of parasite genes.  The resulting diverse platform is expected to provide a rapid path to discovery and eventual introduction of a novel class of anti-parasite drugs with broad-spectrum activity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project creates a drug-screening platform for discovery of new antiparasitic drugs. Resistance to current drug treatments is on the rise. New antiparasitic drugs under development are mostly focused on neurotransmission targets, yet a new target has recently emerged, the daf-12 gene. Knudra uses a core expertise in nematode bioengineering to insert parasite genes into the C. elegans roundworm. Drug candidates are found against the parasite gene by the use of biosensor backgrounds, which use fluorescent gene-expression reporters that turn red upon detection of antiparasitic activity. Phase I feasibility is demonstrated when known agonist and antagonist of DAF-12 elicit expected activity on the parasite gene. The platform may then be used to screen compound libraries to find candidates for anthelmintic use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the creation of a screening platform for finding antiparasitics to help in the battle against important diseases such as elephantiasis, river blindness, trichinosis, Enterobiasis (pinworm), and parasitic infections in livestock and crops. Parasitic infection in livestock and humans currently are treated with more than 20 drugs on the market, but some are toxic and carry black box warnings.  Food and health security throughout the world would be enhanced with the development of new antiparasites that are safer and more effective.  In addition, the technology will help to bring clarity of understanding to the biology of infective-state formation in parasite lifecycle.

    This Small Business Innovations Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using Miromatrix' perfusion decellularization technology to create a fully revascularized cardiac patch for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and congenital heart repair. While medical advancements have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients, therapeutic options are lacking to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue, resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% at five years. For congenital repair, current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow and remodel with the patient.  The proposed cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch may promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to native cardiac tissue.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this research are the development of a revascularized cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair.  Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion. This product with have significant advantages over existing technologies, including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies. Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, revascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart.

    Broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  is to (1) improve the decision making towards protein therapeutics development (also known as developability), (2) reduce Research and Development costs for the Biotechnology industry in general, (3) improve timelines of new protein therapeutic candidates, thus proceeding to clinical phase trials sooner,  (4) resulting in fewer candidate withdrawals from clinical trials, (5) reduce risk associated with protein aggregation and immunogenicity, a potentially fatal outcome; leading to (6) overall quicker times for approval-to-market, and finally (7) a reduction of product recall risk. The market opportunity for protein characterization and identification market by instruments also known as life sciences tools is estimated to be $ 80-85 billion dollars. Our product is an innovative patented technology platform and related services which will support the developability evaluation of new protein therapeutic candidates in the biologics and biosimilars product portfolio. As an additional funding source, we have adopted the production of a high quality aggregate free potential diagnostic candidate biomarker for prostrate and pancreatic cancer to allow for further research and development in other research institutions.  Completion of Phase I in the evaluation of formulation conditions of protein therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will ensure progress towards the development of a high throughput platform for Phase II evaluation.


    The proposed project will address the current bottleneck of new protein therapeutics within the biologics and biosimilars industry due to protein aggregation. This is the single most prevalent reason that has hampered the release of biotherapeutics into the market. Protein aggregation leads to loss of efficacy and potentially to immunogenicity risks.  Formulation is critical to downstream processing, dosing, storage, and delivery of protein therapeutics. Our goal is to test different formulation conditions through the use of Design of Experiment strategies to identify the formulation conditions under which the monoclonal antibody candidate is stable and aggregation free, even under stress.   We have designed an innovative patented platform using two dimensional infrared (2D IR) correlation spectroscopy and perturbation correlation (PC) analysis which is accurate, reproducible and does not use probes to determine the mechanism and extent of aggregation, and stability of a mAb. A potential outcome will be the developability assessment of novel candidates ensuring a pipeline of protein therapeutics early in the research and development. If successful, Phase II will involve a high-throughput platform to address the evaluation of protein aggregation in plasma and final IV delivery conditions, for the design of a predictive model for immunogenicity risk assessment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the challenge of integrating two powerful single-cell analysis tools with the aim of developing and validating new biomarkers for malignancy. The deformability of invasive cells has long been hypothesized to confer their ability to migrate through tight tissue barriers and form metastases. Recently, this idea has been supported by mechanical measurements of cells either isolated from or directly in biological fluid specimens. This convergence of ideas from both biological and physical sciences represents a mechanical biomarker, and tools to be employed clinically to assay these properties are rapidly being developed. Cytovale?s technology measures cell deformability at a throughput of several thousand cells per second, comparable to the ubiquitous flow cytometer, which allows immediate measurement of cells directly in biological fluids. This technology has a demonstrated utility: highly sensitive detection of malignancy in cellularly heterogeneous clinical pleural effusions. Its integration with fluorescence in this project will provide a transformational research and clinical tool, well-aligned with the critical aims of improving patient care and reducing costs through automation, early detection of disease, and use of quantitative, novel biomarkers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is realized by appreciating the applicability of the technology across research and clinical settings. Even without integration with fluorescence (flow) cytometry the technology has demonstrated its utility as a sensitive detector of malignancy in clinical specimens, specifically, pleural effusions. However, cell mechanics is an attractive biomarker for invasiveness, and is likely conserved throughout cells found in many biological fluids, including urine and fine needle aspirates. The proposed activity will further enhance the technology?s diagnostic accuracy. The instruments developed by Cytovale will be placed in clinical cytology labs to complement gold standard cytological methods, performing high sensitivity screens of biological fluids and eliminating unnecessary, invasive, and costly follow-up procedures. The hybrid instrument will also be an especially powerful tool for exploring connections between cell mechanics and traditional markers, which greatly extends the number of research laboratories which would benefit from this enabling technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in detecting sepsis early in its course, before end organ damage when it is most treatable. Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined and is associated with ~$17B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. We anticipate that providing emergency department physicians with an earlier diagnostic will profoundly influence clinical outcomes (currently ~40% mortality), costs (>$22,000/case), and the quality of life for survivors and their families. Accumulating evidence connects systemic immune activation ? a key process in sepsis ? with single-cell architectural changes that are mechanically measured by high-speed mechanical phenotyping technology. This technology is well-suited for adult sepsis screening in the emergency department (market size of $1.5B) due to: (1) the functional analysis of cell state the mechanical measurement provides, (2) its high achievable throughput and therefore statistical accuracy, (3) exceedingly short turnaround time, (4) low cost of goods, and (5) the clinically-actionable information it provides. Beyond the adult sepsis screening market, several additional indications include neonatal sepsis, bladder cancer detection, academic research tools, and drug development.


    The proposed project brings an innovative new class of biomarkers to bear on a problem that has been intractable with current biomarkers.  Briefly, the physical properties of cells have been known to be important for decades, but only with the advent of breakthrough microfluidic technology have we been able to measure these parameters in a high-throughput manner capable of diagnosing disease.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award will be used to develop and validate innovative sample preparation and image analysis modules for a sepsis screening technology as well as performance of proof-of-concept clinical studies that would be a flagship offering in using biomechanical biomarkers to diagnose disease. The technical objectives are designed to improve sensitivity to white blood cells, activated during sepsis, by microfluidic automation of sample preparation and optimization of the microscopic imaging optics. In addition to preparing the test for practical implementation in the emergency department, the test will be validated with a proof-of-concept clinical study, and a clinical scoring system will be devised.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support development and testing of a novel cost-effective mechanical ventilator. The H1N1 pandemic ignited concern in the healthcare community over the state of preparedness of our nation?s healthcare system in the event of a critical care emergency. If a 1918-like flu pandemic were to occur today, tens of millions of people could die from respiratory distress. Unfortunately, the United States does not have enough ventilators to support patients with respiratory distress. When considered on a global scale, the disparity in critical care and emergency resources between wealthy and impoverished nations is alarming. The goal of this proposal is to progress from a high-level prototype to pre-production status. Iterative performance testing and redesign will be followed by human factors validation and interface design with simulated use modeling. Completion of Phase I will place the company in a position to begin verification testing and validation of mechanical components and software in Phase II. The next step is regulatory approval following a 510k pathway and sales expected to begin within 2 years of the Phase I start date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to conquer one of the most difficult problems in critical care: delivering high precision, high reliability and low cost in a mechanical ventilator. If a flu pandemic were to occur today, millions of people could die from respiratory distress. Unfortunately, the United States does not have enough ventilators to support patients with respiratory distress in even a mild pandemic. Respiratory illness is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in emerging nations. Each year thousands of patients die in rural community hospitals because of lack of access to mechanical ventilation. Despite improvements in infrastructure and economies, ventilators remain out of reach for many hospitals. At present, the mechanical ventilation market is more than $2 billion globally and growing at 7%. Commercialization of this novel ventilator design would provide a viable option for stockpiling ventilators in the event of a mass casualty event and hospitals in emerging markets will finally be able to afford high performance ventilation for their intesive care units.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide the basis for producing a unique cytocompatible, liquid adhesive bandage that will facilitate wound healing. This project is based upon a correlation of surface free energy of hydrated, amphiphilic polymers and their ability to support cell functions, such as growth and proliferation, deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, and patterns of substrate surface coverage and morphology.  Current commercially available liquid adhesive bandages for professional applications on humans are used in a variety of wound coverage applications. However, there is no liquid adhesive bandage commercially available for human use that serves as a cell substrate as well as protecting a wound from foreign contaminants. The research will determine the surface free energies of a variety of amphiphilic polymers, ranging from highly hydrophilic to highly hydrophobic, and then correlate the surface free energy data to the cytocompatibility of the respective polymer films.  It is anticipated that this approach will result in a selection of polymers in a narrow range of surface free energies that can accelerate tissue regrowth for wound healing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the creation of a new form of medical treatment for acute wounds (e.g., surgery sites, injuries),  for chronic wounds (e.g., ulcers) and for burn wounds utilizing a simple, low cost, intimately conformal, protective polymer coating material that is capable of facilitating tissue regeneration. Such a coating will function as a synthetic skin substitute that will allow wounds to heal rapidly, without external contamination, such as from bacteria and other microorganisms, because of its ability to facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation. Importantly, this polymer coating will self-remove over time as the wound heals, in contrast to typical bandages that can cause new tissue abrasion and rupture when manually removed. This project will demonstrate how enhanced cytocompatibility of liquid adhesive bandages, and synthetic skin substitutes in general, can be obtained in topical wound care, thus leading to a reduction of patient suffering and a reduction in this nation's health care costs. The commercial impact of this product will be game-changing for topical wound treatment in that future materials should facilitate healthy tissue regrowth.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the expedited development of a novel non?]surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far?]reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy?]to?]use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent development of a commercially viable, FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.


    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non?]surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability of a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning, and further to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear. Building on a successful proof?]of?]concept prototype, multiple candidate designs will be developed, fabricated and validated using benchtop models. Testing will explore challenges with maintaining electrode?]skin contact during patient mobility and effective management of bodily fluids (i.e. leakage). Throughout the project, increasingly complex models will be utilized, concluding with assessment in human cadaveric tissue. The project is expected to identify a preferred candidate electrode design suitable for future evaluation in a human clinical study, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases.  As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually.  A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase I project will advance understanding of silk-vaccine interactions,
    which is needed to guide formulation development.  Furthermore, insight into the
    immunogenicity of silk fibroin itself, as well as the impact of silk on the immunogenicity
    of a vaccine antigen, will be gained in these studies. This technology has significant
    commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied to numerous emerging and
    existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market.  \n\nThe proposed project
    seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global need for robust,
    thermostable vaccines.  Thermal instability is a long-standing problem in vaccine
    development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current formulation approaches
    do not allow product storage under ambient conditions. Temperature excursions
    during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage or administration
    of suboptimal vaccines.  The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost biomaterial, represents
    a novel approach to vaccine stabilization.  The goal of the proposed research
    is to demonstrate feasibility of the silk-stabilization platform to create a rotavirus
    formulation that does not require cold storage.  In addition to traditional liquid
    and lyophilized vaccine formats, development of a dissolvable thin film strip
    for oral delivery will be investigated.  The proposed research will identify lead
    candidate silk-rotavirus formulations with improved thermostability and immunogenicity
    that is at least equivalent to the existing commercial formulation, while offering
    critical insight into broader issues of vaccine stabilization with silk."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution, protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. Additionally besides the emotional and physical burden of vision loss, the cost of vision problems in the US alone is estimated at $139 billion. The work outlined in this SBIR proposal has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of retinal degenerative diseases, as well as the field of retinal prosthetics. The subretinal implant under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration, and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality of life.   ------------------

    The proposed project seeks to quantify the spatial resolution of a flexible, protein-based, ion-mediated retinal implant, as well as to perform an initial evaluation of the implant in vivo. The retinal implant under development is the first implantable technology to use the light-activated protein, bacteriorhodopsin, to convert light energy into an ion gradient that is capable of activating the remaining neural circuitry of the degenerate retina. The retinal implant will replace the function of the damaged photoreceptor cells. Spatial resolution will be evaluated ex vivo using excised retinas obtained from a transgenic rat model of retinitis pigmentosa. Extracellular microelectrode array experiments will be carried out to demonstrate the resolution of the implant, which is critical for meaningful vision. Safety and efficacy of the implant will be evaluated in vivo via a 6-week feasibility study on domestic swine. These in vivo studies are critical to establish the surgical procedures and biocompatibility and biostability of the implant in preparation for long-term, rigorous, preclinical efficacy testing of the implant as part of Phase II investigations. These experiments are critical value creation milestones that will demonstrate the commercial viability of the retinal implant under development.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on
    the development of a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that
    is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign.  Current technologies,
    e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high
    cost of energy, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation
    of micron-sized particles.  The proposed large volume flow rate acoustophoretic
    separation technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates
    at a low cost of energy, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles.
    \ Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid
    stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger
    than the combined effect of fluid drag force and buoyancy.  The action of the
    acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in concentration, agglomeration
    and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are
    separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through
    enhanced buoyancy.  This project combines experiment and computer modeling to
    probe the interaction between piezo-electric transducers and the acoustic field
    to maximize the acoustic trapping potential and to provide results to create scalable
    systems and economic models of capital and operational expense of the technology.
    \ \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel
    acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of
    energy separation of multi-component phase mixtures.  It can function as a drop-in
    replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and
    other methods.   The societal impact is the development of separation technologies
    that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any
    waste or use consumables.  Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from
    water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and
    reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment.  This project
    increases the science and technology of acoustic radiation force in ultrasonic
    standing waves.  A full three-dimensional accounting of the acoustic radiation
    force in realistic geometries will be done.  Dissemination of this work will be
    done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences.  This
    project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an
    opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship
    at a small start-up company.  FD Sonics has a strong history and commitment to
    integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through
    offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects."

    This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is aimed at demonstrating that acyl glycinate surfactant can be produced by a novel bacterial fermentation route. The objective of this project is to construct a bacterial strain that produces acyl glycinate, and to provide a sample of that surfactant for commercial evaluation. A successful outcome will demonstrate that acyl glycine can be produced by fermentation. Surfactants are the bubbly components of cleaning products that give them their cleansing power. Surfactants are currently manufactured from petroleum or from seed oils, such as palm oil. The use of those raw materials increases greenhouse gas pollution and also leads to deforestation of rainforests. Retailers are demanding greener products, and regulatory agencies are demanding new minimally toxic chemicals. The demand for greener chemicals creates an opportunity to replace current surfactants with greener alternatives.

    The broader/commercial impact of the proposed innovation would be commercialization of the acyl glycinate surfactant. Additional benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete with food sources. Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature. The chemicals are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased greenhouse gas accumulation. Successful completion of the project will generate significant new scientific and technical information on new routes to making such surfactants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves a significant enhancement in the properties of wood polymer composites (WPCs) by the commercialization of a highly effective bio-based coupling agent made from renewable sources such as plant oils instead of petroleum. By significantly enhancing the properties of WPCs, substantial benefit to society will result by providing new application opportunities for these relatively low cost, light weight biocomposites.  Globally millions of metric tons of WPCs are produced each year.  Currently, WPCs are used for applications that do not require high load bearing characteristics due to limitations in modulus, strength, and creep.  The technical concepts proposed for the Phase I effort are expected to enable higher modulus and strength, by facilitating the use of higher wood flour (WF) loadings, as well as lower deformation by introducing crosslinks into the matrix phase.  Although this proposal is focused on the utility of these novel bio-based copolymers as high performance coupling agents, these copolymers have also been demonstrated to be excellent binders for coatings.  Thus, commercialization of these copolymers is expected to have a broader impact on society beyond use as coupling agents.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will determine the feasibility of novel bio-based polymers to serve as highly effective coupling agents for WPCs.  The most common WPCs are based on WF as the dispersed-phase and high density polyethylene (HDPE) as the matrix.  WF is a very desirable reinforcement for composites because it is inexpensive, abundant, biodegradable, high modulus, high strength, light weight, and non-abrasive toward processing equipment. The major technical challenge for HDPE/WF composites is obtaining adequate compatibility between the WF fibers and the HDPE matrix.  Although the modulus and tensile strength of WF fibers is approximately 40 and 20 times higher than that of the HDPE matrix, respectively, the mechanical property enhancements provided by the WF cannot be fully realized without effective compatibilization.  It is the team?s belief that the bio-based polymers proposed for the project possess the ideal chemical composition for effectively coupling the HDPE matrix to the WF fibers to maximize mechanical properties.  In addition, the polymers are capable of introducing crosslinks into the matrix phase, which are expected to reduce polymer creep.  For the Phase I project, the effect of the chemical composition of the bio-based coupling agent will be a primary factor investigated.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support a new synthetic chemical approach for the creation of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Creating these imaging products relies on the rapid and efficient labeling of tracer molecules with a radioisotope ([18F]fluoride). The difficulties inherent in radiofluorination chemistry have severely limited the scope of radiotracers available for clinical use. This NSF SBIR Phase 1 project addresses this critical problem using the company?s proprietary single-step fluorination technology. This technology advances the current state-of-the-art with simple, fast, and highly efficient radiofluorination, permitting an entire new class of drugs to be labeled with no-carrier-added [18F]fluoride for the first time. The project will focus on the synthesis of clinically relevant radiotracers for pediatric cancer and Parkinson?s disease. Technical studies to be performed using this support include optimization of this new radiofluorination manufacturing methodology across multiple radiosynthesis platforms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide technology to expand the scope of PET as a platform for determining the identification and staging of diseases, and assessing the efficacy of treatment regimens. PET is an underutilized diagnostic imaging technique that is stymied by the lack of highly efficient, broadly applicable radiofluorination methods. The radiotracer manufacturing technology developed here is extremely general and applicable to the preparation of new imaging agents for PET. The availability of this general labeling technique can also speed development of new drugs by providing in vivo biomarkers of new therapeutic agents which can be used to determine optimal dosing of new drugs and variability of biodistribution in target populations. The commercial potential of PET imaging is significant; the worldwide market for PET is expected to grow to $15 billion by 2015. There is also room for significant expansion of this market as new imaging agents become available.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to increase the effectiveness of oxidative enzymes of high potential in chemical synthesis and chemical remediation applications.  Enzyme-based systems, the greenest and most energy efficient processes known to-date, are replacing chemical-based systems due to their superior potential for energy savings and environmental benefits. While at the forefront of the green chemistry revolution, however, enzyme-based systems are difficult to come by. Their adoption has not been as fast, as widespread, or as beneficial as it otherwise could be because oxidative enzymes are not cost effective enough to replace chemicals. This project is developing an integrated technology for oxidative enzymes for industrial use. The project objectives consist of (1) manufacturing continuous flow reactors dedicated to processing ZYMtronix?s catalysts, (2) developing a synthesis process for key pharmaceutical precursors used in cancer treatment, and (3) demonstrating the remediation application for industrial contaminants. The anticipated technical results will benchmark reactor characteristics and the catalytic metrics of the aforementioned processes.

    The broader commercial potential of this project is to facilitate the adoption of oxidative enzymes in synthesis and remediation applications because they can replace precious metal catalysts, toxic solvents, and energy intensive processes.  Additional benefits translate to safer processes and products for manufacturers, consumers and the environment. ZYMtronix patent-pending technology is estimated to be substantially more efficient and cost effective to operate when compared with chemical systems, increasing enzyme activity, decreasing enzyme inhibition, and expanding the enzyme´s range of operable conditions. Combined with proprietary reactors being developed, the catalysts can be recycled for continuous use. ZYMtronix´s technology serves the fine chemicals, pharmaceutical, as well as the water remediation, markets applicable to oxidative enzyme processes.

    explores a transformational visibly transparent photovoltaic (PV) device. Building-integrated
    photovoltaics (BIPV) are a promising energy pathway to capturing large areas of
    solar energy and increasing U.S. building efficiency at the point of utilization.
    However, the widespread adoption of such technologies is severely hampered by
    the cost and aesthetics associated with mounting traditional PV modules on siding
    and windows. Here, these challenges are overcome by exploiting the excitonic character
    of molecular and organic semiconductors that lead to \"oscillator bunching\" to
    produce PV architectures with selective absorption, i.e. exhibiting visible minima
    and ultra-violet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) maxima, uniquely distinct from the
    band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors. By using excitonic molecular
    semiconductors with structured absorption in the NIR/UV these devices are simultaneously
    optimized for high power conversion efficiency, visible light transmission, and
    color rendering index. Accordingly, the aim of this program is to reach relevant
    size, lifetime, aesthetic, and form-factor objectives that will demonstrate the
    feasibility of developing the proof-of-concept prototypes into a commercially

    and energy independence by producing electricity at the point of utilization,
    (2) reducing building cooling demands by rejecting infrared solar heat, supplementing
    or replacing existing low-E and solar-control window coatings, and (3) achieving
    low levelized energy costs by piggybacking on the installation, framing, and maintenance
    of the existing building envelope. Installed window surface area in the U.S. equipped
    with such films represents hundreds of terawatt-hours of potential energy, comprising
    energy generation and energy savings. Moreover, this project will result in a
    core knowledge from which future generations of transparent photovoltaic devices
    and materials will be designed. Visibly transparent PVs are also amenable to seamless
    energy harvesting within non-window surfaces such as electronic displays and mobile
    electronic accessories, enhancing the functionality of those products without
    impacting aesthetics or functionality. The deployment of transparent PVs, both
    domestically and abroad, supports American efforts to maintain technological and
    economic leadership in developing and implementing advanced technologies, by revolutionizing
    the way electricity is generated and consumed."

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project explores an autonomous electrochromic (EC) window enabled by a visibly transparent photovoltaic coating technology. EC windows, which transition from a transparent state to a dark state (and vice-versa) based on an electrical input, represent a promising pathway to increasing building energy efficiency by effectively regulating the solar flux into the building. Though well-developed technologically, broad adoption of EC windows is limited by installation challenges rooted in a lack of autonomy (i.e. wiring to an external energy source, sensors, and control systems). The team has identified a key solution in which visibly-transparent photovoltaic coatings are integrated over the EC to serve as (1) an onboard energy source that harvests ambient light to power EC transitions, and (2) a photodetector that enables dynamic transparency control in response to changes in external lighting conditions. This project will demonstrate relevant performance and durability specifications of the photovoltaic coating to initiate large-area window integration and commercial deployment of autonomous EC windows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is embodied by unprecedented freedom for architectural EC window adoption, which can reduce electricity consumption for cooling, lighting, and peak power demands in buildings by up to 15%-50%. By integrating power and sensing functionalities onboard with the EC window without impacting visual aesthetics, a fully autonomous insulated glazing unit (IGU) can be constructed that requires no specialized installation or external balance of systems. Ultimately this will significantly broaden adoption of EC windows, by eliminating concerns related to the cost and complexity of EC installation, thus improving payback period and simplifying the decision-making process within the supply chain of the built environment. Moreover, this project will result in the development of knowledge that will guide future generations of visibly-transparent photovoltaics for other products in which a local energy source and light detection functionality can provide significant value (e.g. electronic displays and mobile electronic accessories), enhancing the functionality of those products without impacting aesthetics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research Phase 1 project is to develop a new, cheaper process to mine gold and silver without using and polluting the environment with sodium cyanide. This will allow the development of new "green" mines, that are environmentally friendly and economically viable. The current state of the art is to use the 120yrs old sodium cyanide process carried out at vast scale worldwide. The new process, discovered at Northwestern University is being further developed by Cycladex. Gold and silver mining is still an important industry for the US with substantial yet untapped reserves and this new process if successful will generate jobs and increase the US development of its own resources. The proposed technology development with in this project will help directly address the environmental, economic, health and social impacts and benefits of current gold mining technology, improving workers' health and safety, enhancing the participation of local and indigenous communities and women and fostering sustainable mining practices in the developing and developed world. About 18% of all gold is still mined by the poor in the third world who use liquid mercury to extract gold.

    The objectives of this Phase 1 research are to develop a commercial process using the new Cycladex technology, prove the economics and to develop a manufacturing process, which can be scaled up at a gold mine. There are two parts to be developed, the initial extraction of gold using environmentally benign agents and then the isolation of the gold by crystallization using a commercially available natural product. The project will focus on establishing a novel and superior sustainable gold production process with high selectivity, productivity, capital cost and process economics compared to today's technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a novel bioelectrochemical system for combined treatment of carbon and nitrogen in the wastewater of re-circulating and semi-re-circulating aquaculture facilities. The aquaculture industry is currently held-back by high levels of wastewater and expensive treatment technologies. Elevated levels of nitrogen versus carbon in aquaculture wastewater require several expensive and energy-intensive steps for complete treatment. Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) represent a new technology capable of treating wastewater in an energy-positive manner while producing fewer byproducts than existing technologies. The project will construct and evaluate a novel three-cell BES that can treat several of the most important water pollutants in a combined, energy-positive step. Phase I will prove feasibility of the technology and quantify system performance. Phase II studies will develop detailed designs and begin pilot studies at IntAct or in the field, pending Phase I results.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this research are to demonstrate a novel approach to aquaculture wastewater treatment with the potential to significantly enhance the economic of re-circulating and semi-recirculating aquaculture systems. Fish farming is emerging as a critical 21st century industry, with global annual production already more than 60 million tons. Yet industry growth is constrained by competition for water and the high cost of wastewater treatment technologies. By reducing energy-intensiveness and combining treatment processes, bio-electrochemical systems have the potential to greatly enhance the economics of re-circulating and semi-recirculation aquaculture facilities and the environmental sustainability of the industry.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an anaerobic digestion system which utilizes bio-electrodes to more efficiently convert wastewater into biogas and ultimately energy.  Bio-electrochemical systems have received significant attention in recent years with the discovery of electricigen microbes capable of transferring electrons to and from electrodes at high rates. To date, most research has focused on using these processes in fuel-cell-like devices to produce electricity or hydrogen. In this project, IntAct will build and demonstrate a simplified process for enhanced anaerobic digestion based on adding electrodes and applying voltage directly into an AD chamber. The resulting proprietary system makes use of an applied voltage to modulate the growth of electricigen microbes on electrodes thus overcoming thermodynamic limitations to methane production and enabling pH control.

    The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the ability to recover increased amounts of energy from the wastewater treatment process.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a prototype system that teaches children how to solve seemingly hopeless mathematical problems. Problems differ from exercises in that it is not immediately clear how to approach them. They require hard thinking, not complicated calculations. For example, the system's intelligent avatar will help students discover a method to calculate the Earth-Moon distance with nothing more than basic geometry and a lot of thinking and experimentation. Problems are presented by the avatar in 2D or in captivating 3D virtual worlds. The joy of (guided) discovery is envisioned to increase students' interest in math and other STEM disciplines and to significantly reduce math anxiety. The new rigorous math education standards require strong problem solving skills from each student including at-risk populations. The steady increase of student population also puts enormous pressure on schools to assist the work of their teachers. It is envisioned that the system's unique advantages over competitive solutions could ultimately make it a "must have" for the nation's 132,000 schools educating 58 million K-12 students. The project is expected to contribute to a markedly better math education.

    The most important technical innovations of this project are the emulation of natural-style teacher-student interactions in the domain of mathematics education, the teaching of proven problem solving strategies by an expert avatar, and the use of immersive 3D virtual worlds to help develop deep insight and advanced problem solving skills. The goal of the Phase I research is to develop a prototype system and scientifically evaluate its promise to improve students' problem solving skills in grades 6-8 within the context of the content domains and standards of mathematical practice specified by the Common Core State Standards.  The system's Socratic avatar asks students purposeful questions in relation to a given problem. Students respond in a variety of constrained ways: construct written answers by dragging and dropping words into the right place, or by manipulating objects in the virtual environment. Student reasoning skills are tested continuously and non-intrusively during teach the avatar sessions in which roles are reversed and students demonstrate to a novice avatar how to solve a given problem. This will reveal a wide range of knowledge gaps in conceptual understanding and the use of particular mathematical methods. The researchers will analyze students' improvement in a pretest-posttest control group experiment.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project aims to provide a cloud based software platform to deliver entrepreneurship education at scale. Innovation is the first step along the journey towards commercialization, job creation and profitability. On a good day this path is dark, winding, uphill and unpaved. At LaunchPad Central, they are rapidly creating the ability to help pave this road to increase the odds of successfully navigating this journey. The data from early stage startups will add to the "intellectual exhaust" allowing for pattern recognition of early warning signs of failure. The LaunchPad Central team has the domain expertise required to architect this platform. Collectively they possess an in-depth understanding of the requirements. A world-class board of advisors including Steve Blank, author of The Four Steps to Epiphany and the Startup Owners Manual (standard entrepreneurship texts across top universities worldwide) gives the company an unparalleled intellectual advantage on best practices to deliver this content at scale. The company has the experience of teaching this process in classroom and synchronous online formats to graduate engineering, MBA students and scientists/researchers from research universities. This has given the team considerable collective intellectual and operational experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can be significant. The NSF Innovation Corps program has adopted Steve Blank's Lean LaunchPad process in 2011. One hundred NSF I-Corps funded teams have graduated and are on their way to successfully commercializing their lab research. The program is set to scale over the next 18-24 months. LaunchPad Central enables the successful scale of this program for early stage technologies from the top universities to learn how to navigate the financial valley of death as they seek to commercialize their science in scalable and sustainable ways.  LaunchPad Central will have a much broader impact for entrepreneurs on Main Street. The Small Business Administration could offer the tools that have been tried and tested by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Decreasing the odds of failure for small businesses (the backbone of the US economy) can have a profound impact on job creation. Scalable startups have historically grown from innovation and entrepreneurship hubs like Silicon Valley, Boston etc. Their software provides the metrics to identify promising entrepreneur across the country and potentially connecting them to mentors and investors in Silicon Valley.

    of an accessible end-user programming environment so that middle and high school
    students can create their own custom ensembles or blocks of robots and observe
    how the blocks' behavior affect an entire robot. Building powerful and correct
    intuitions about the behavior of complex systems is important for scientists and

    for embedded microprocessors, children can build and observe complex systems acting
    in the real world. Although end-user programming environments exist for software
    systems, and even for a few robotics toys, no competing approach to end user programming
    tackles distributed processing for modular robotics. The project aims to build
    three experimental systems: a text-based environment, a visual programming language,

    version of kit will be released in three phases: to science centers and children's
    museums initially, to a core community of technically savvy enthusiasts, and finally
    to the public through retail channels. Several science centers have expressed
    serious and persistent interest in acquiring initial versions of the kits and
    incorporating them into robotics education programs and exhibits. In addition
    to the project's primary objective, the design and testing of end-user programming
    for distributed embedded computing can inform other applications of this technology

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a construction kit toy and accompanying activities for teaching and learning engineering design synthesis. Routine engineering analysis can be automated, but design synthesis still remains largely the province of creative and knowledgeable human beings.  The problem is that design synthesis is taught poorly, if at all. Construction kit toys offer a way to solve this problem: they invite young people into engineering design synthesis in playful yet intellectually challenging ways.   Beyond teaching specific domain knowledge, construction kits engage young learners in goal-directed experimental exploration, acquiring and practicing skills central to creativity and invention in engineering design. Current mechatronics construction kit toys are either too simple or limited to allow serious designing, or they are powerful but so technically demanding as to exclude many who otherwise might like to play. The specific innovation of our EYVO construction kit for mechatronics through elegant encapsulation of function and simplicity of physical design?will dramatically lower barriers for young people to engage significantly with engineering design synthesis.  This project will develop the EYVO prototype and accompanying educational materials, test it with children, and investigate its commercial potential.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is as follows. Throughout the twentieth century the US led the world in science and technology innovation, but this competitive advantage is steadily eroding.   US children lag behind peer nations in STEM knowledge and skills, crucial for the nation?s technological leadership and economic future. Many young people are discouraged from pursuing STEM interests because, despite interest, early encounters lead them to believe that they have poor aptitude.   They turn away (or feel excluded) from STEM fields because the barriers to entry seem too high or because they think it?s boring or difficult. Unlike competing products such as LEGO Mindstorms, VEX Robotics, and Meccano the EYVO construction kit developed in this project invites young people to engage immediately?without prologue and without need for prior technical proficiency?in serious yet playful engineering design.  Through play with EYVO they can learn that engineering design is fun, and more importantly, a domain in which they can excel.   By making the kit affordable to individuals, schools, and informal science institutions, the project will make engineering design synthesis skills attractive and accessible to populations that historically have largely been excluded from, or disinterested in, STEM learning.

- abstractText: "This SBIR project's innovation is a unique web-based authoring framework
    for creating animated interactive web content that replaces university-level STEM
    (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) textbooks in traditional or online
    courses. The confluence of HTML5, cloud services, and ubiquitous portable devices
    enables widespread use of web-native content having engaging effective activities
    for students including animations, interactive simulators including mini-games,
    and self-assessments. Such content is difficult to develop/maintain in traditional
    publishing paradigms involving a small author/editor core team. A wiki-style crowdsourced
    approach, with oversight by an author/editor core team, is more scalable but web-based
    authoring tools support only limited content types like text or drawings. The
    project's intellectual merit lies in developing a novel web-based authoring tool
    for creating HTML5 code for animations, including a novel automated synthesis
    of the code from abstract restricted-form English-sentence specifications inspired
    by experiences in developing state-of-the-art automated circuit synthesis techniques.
    The merit also lies in a new repository of parameterized interactive simulations
    with potentially wide applicability in STEM fields. Results will include the initial
    tool and repository, plus use by instructors and graduate students from several
    universities to demonstrate crowdsourcing feasibility.  \n\nThe broader/commercial
    impact of this project includes catalyzing a new partnering approach between a
    publisher and universities, striking a new balance between core-team authored
    content and crowdsourcing. A core author/editor team creates initial content and
    outlines needs, requiring less upfront investment, and the community adopts the
    content and contributes items under the core team's curation. Curated crowdsourced
    content can dramatically improve content and reduce creation/maintenance costs.
    The approach can expand to curated crowdsourced homeworks, automated grading,
    online help tools, quizzing services, student performance analysis, and more,
    unleashing synergy among universities to build common tools that benefit the community,
    a necessity made manifest due to drastic reductions in university budgets. The
    project's initial focus on computer science lower-division topics may yield company
    revenues of $5M in textbooks within a few years and $10M considering expanded
    services shifted from university to company, for CS alone, and $40M-$50M for multiple
    STEM disciplines. The addressable market for lower division STEM is $1B textbooks
    and $2B expanded services. The project's approach provides a practical strategy,
    with individual instructors initially adopting the content as a textbook replacement
    for campus-based or online classes, followed by possible expanded service arrangements
    made with departments/universities."

    of an advanced personalized learning system for pre-collegiate and remedial Algebra,
    with future extension to other scientific and mathematical disciplines.  The project
    aims to model learning as a complex dynamics system, and to develop a user-model
    that incorporates student profile data with a detailed and large set of markers
    on usage and performance collected from an analytics engine.  These markers can
    be derived from a student's learning and social activities, such as her interaction
    with various types of learning resources, participation on question and answer
    forums and so on. This model then guides a recommender system to select appropriate
    resources from a learning catalog based on the student's unique learning path.
    \  Whereas, the project uses open source recommender algorithms, the intellectual
    merit lies in developing a user model, identifying the specific markers that impact
    learning, automatically reconfiguring the learning material, and in demonstrating
    its viability for algebra learners.  This model will be built leveraging some
    of the latest infrastructures in education technology including an authoring and

    and the latest advances in data-analytics and information filtering systems. \n\nThe
    broader/commercial impact lies in using the proposed technology to replace textbooks

    will significantly impact students who today struggle with mathematics and STEM
    subjects, by providing alternate and more relevant ways for them to visualize
    and learn.  Additionally, Zyante's technology and expanded services will enable
    colleges/universities to offer high-quality online courses and successfully handle
    larger enrollments.  All this will ultimately improve national outcomes and provide

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a developmentally appropriate robotic construction kit specifically designed for early childhood education (PreK-2) for teaching the components of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), especially the "T" of technology and the "E" of engineering, which have been the most neglected for this age segment. Recent research on educational robotics has not focused on the foundational years. However, both from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational interventions that begin in early childhood are associated with lower costs and more durable effects. The proposed work is consistent with the increasing Federal efforts to focus on early childhood education. It is organized around several technical and business questions: 1. What design principles inform creation of a developmentally appropriate robotic kit to be manufactured at low-cost?  2. What are the most feasible technical mechanisms for the robotic kit to be programmed by young children through the use of tangible blocks without a computer screen?  3. What manufacturing processes are needed for scaling from single prototypes to large-scale volume? 4. What are the outcomes of user testing with children, teachers and parents in school and home settings?  5. What is a sustainable commercialization plan?

    The broader/commercial impact of this proposal is that it will contribute to the emerging field of robotics in education by addressing the needs of an educational segment, early childhood, that today lacks the necessary tools for teaching technology and engineering in a developmentally appropriate way. This work comes at a time of re-envisioning early childhood education at the Federal level, and an accepted need to develop innovative new technologies and approaches for STEM. This interdisciplinary proposal makes contributions to the fields of learning technologies, computer science education, early childhood education and human-computer interaction. At the same time it provides an opportunity to address the needs of a target audience that, according to the latest US Census, consists of approximately 13.3 million children. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an engaging online learning game using venomous marine snails as a conduit to explore scientific issues in nature through creative problem solving. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies have indicated it is not what we teach, but how we teach that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. A strong case is being made for using learning games to convey educational content. This project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project will be a propriety digital learning game including a unique parent/player assessment tool used to measure novel STEM content during game playing and extending opportunities for learners to engage in ongoing scientific research ("citizen science"). Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific discoveries in predatory marine snail research for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF's mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online games that continuously engage users in the scientific process of discovery and application of science learning using a novel player/parent data aggregator dashboard. Our inventive two-sided player/parent dashboard will allow players to measure their progress and attain unique, educational rewards such as unlocking new game components, and identifying local citizen science projects to enhance their STEM learning. The goal of this project is to disrupt the status quo of STEM learning and address STEM learning market needs by combining gameplay, content learning, and assessment tools to develop high-quality, creative, science learning games. A three-component Play-Break-Fix strategy will be used to design and develop all games: 1. Iterative prototyping to generate novel ideas and integrate any existing content. 2. Repetitive evaluation to test the usability of demos and the initial feasibility of the learning games created and parent/player dashboard concept. 3. Commercialization testing of the products from this project that are the best of the build and analyze model. The parent/player assessment dashboard developed in this project will provide a template for furthering parental engagement with children's learning to significantly improve STEM knowledge and will engage players in citizen science experiences that will strengthen their connection to STEM learning.

- abstractText: "This SBIR phase I project offers a unique approach to teaching the
    difficult content of operating with fractions through estimation. Extensive cognitive
    science research shows the importance of estimating on children's sense-making,
    especially within the often counter-intuitive topic of fractions operations. Research
    also shows that estimating fractional numbers is highly predictive of future success
    in mathematics, and early intervention in this area improves long-term outcomes.
    This project aims to improve children's understanding of arithmetic by focusing
    on estimation. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this
    project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor
    students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well
    as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF?s mission of improving mathematics
    education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace
    for research-based, engaging software that correlates highly with long-term academic
    outcomes. This software will be designed especially for children with special
    needs and will meet the criteria for RTI screening and interventions, further
    increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate
    income. \n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a prototype of a game focused on the
    addition and subtraction of fractions through estimation, which will encourage
    sense-making and bolster conceptual understanding. The app will also provide data
    reporting to teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions.
    Extracting actionable insight from children's gameplay rather than from standardized
    assessments, is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change
    how kids learn. The development process will include wire-framing the gameplay
    and developing app components and features. The initial data architecture will
    involve a concept map of student learning behaviors mapped onto teacher actions
    for classroom intervention. The corresponding data structure will collect and
    store data during Phase I in preparation for further analysis and reporting during
    Phase II. The project will involve front-end component testing and follow an iterative
    design process, observing student interactions with the software, making revisions
    and debugging where appropriate. This project's research will include both informal
    design research and components testing as well as a small learning study, a close
    observation of 15-20 students with mathematics learning difficulties, exploring
    the effects of using the fractions software on 5th graders' procedural and conceptual
    knowledge of adding fractions."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to construct the first in a series of science collaborative multiplatform learning games called Martha Madison?s Marvelous Machines.  This game will be designed to engage a target audience of middle school girls in virtual collaborative physics projects to improve understanding of the nature of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and careers. The specific content of this game will enable students to develop understanding of introductory Physics and Engineering aligned with Common Core standards. There will be options for single player play and multi-player play, depending on the platform(s) on which the game is released. In the multi-player option, there will be puzzles which can only be solved through collaboration with other users (via network play). Second Avenue Software (SAS) anticipates the release of Common Core Standards for Science and Martha Madison will be developed according to the Common Core Standards in order to provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn. In the event that Common Core Standards for Science are not in draft form at the time of the award, SAS will draw on its extensive experience correlating with state standards to make a physics and engineering game that is engaging, educative and robust.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in SAS?s contribution to meeting the need of improving physics and engineering education by providing a game-based application which as the potential to increase interest in STEM careers and learning outcomes in STEM disciplines. Based on a review of the literature regarding womens? participation in STEM education, STEM careers and learning modalities for women and girls, this requires development of materials specifically designed to meet their educational needs and interests.  Current practice in commercial games reflects this need.  Games are frequently designed in two versions: one for boys and one for girls, reflecting each gender?s distinct patterns of play. Martha Madison will be designed to appeal to all genders without alienating boys or girls, while paying special attention to engaging girls in STEM learning. Martha Madison will be created using the Unity 3D platform which allows for publishing to a diverse array of applications including tablets, computers, consoles (all of which now include digital delivery), and mobile devices. With so many possible applications, Martha Madison has tremendous commercial potential.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to determine the feasibility of new software implementations of formative assessment (FA) techniques for mathematics instruction. Tablet devices such as the iPad have an enormous potential to facilitate revolutionary change in education, but such potential is heavily dependent on the availability of appropriate software and services. The proposed activities will research the extent to which classroom FA techniques can be applied or enhanced when the teacher's role is augmented by a platform for computer aided instruction. They will seek to create adaptive learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems and that apply the adaptivity to free-form content delivered as instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and to do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural. The proposed activities also have the potential to provide new tools for the analysis of effective techniques in mathematics education and interventions. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.

    The potential broader impacts of the proposed activities include improved student access to mathematics; the increased participation of underrepresented groups in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); and improved STEM education through informed teacher practice and educator development. The proposed activities directly address mathematics education at a critical point in the curriculum: pre-algebra readiness, as set against the widely differing levels of mathematical fluency that emerge out of the elementary grades. Without a solid facility with pre-algebra mathematics, many subjects that are essential to participation in the modern world become difficult or impossible to master and academic confidence and commitment erode. More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less and less comprehensible and through this feedback they face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment practices have been well-established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision making. It is by establishing toolkits with novel, software-based, formative assessment and helping to drive educator adoption of new formative assessment techniques that the proposed research may deliver these broader impacts. By addressing key customer needs, the project will create significant new commercial value within the educational market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Workplace Technologies Research Inc. (WTRI) will explore the basic principles of learning revealed by one of the firm's more highly successful technology implementations in which user knowledge and performance with the system were found to be critical.  The data involved were collected on 3500 shopfloor personnel who were given an activity-based training exercise on a complex computer technology.  WTRI's training was based on research showing that experienced adults learn complex concepts in the context of solving problems at work.  The trainees' acceptance and rapid development as 'expert' users suggest that a particular set of principles used to design the training may be a key element in learning complex technologies.  Further,  the later high performance of highly 'resistant' workers may indicate an important role of resistance in innovation.  The project seeks to identify the important mechanisms of learning and to find ways to broaden their application.  In particular, the project seeks to provide the foundation for designing methods of accelerating learning that can be part of the context of the actual work activity and that will not require the considerable expense and lost productivity incurred with off-line training.  At the same time, the model also has significant potential for enhancing our understanding of 'construction/deconstruction' and the role of resistance in accelerated learning.

    WRTI has conceived of a model, Iterative Technology Implementation Model (ITIM(TM)), to increase technology deployment success rates as measured by time to adoption by the workers and long term retention. The model has great potential for generalizing the facilitation of the process of technology adoption/ replacement, if the principles that have made the approach to training for change and technology adoption so successful can be distilled from the large, rich data set at hand.  This distillation can in turn facilitate appropriate training selection and design and faster implementation of change, thus making needed assistance more affordable to a broader spectrum of companies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need to improve the success rate at which new technologies can be introduced into the workplace.  A methodology and service,  ATTAIN(TM), has been conceived to accelerate the integration of technology by rapidly and aggressively identifying critical processes and practices in the organization and shifting them in value-added ways at the level of worker cognition and operational specifics.  This method has been shown to be highly successful, but is labor intensive, expensive, and requires highly skilled practitioners.  Furthermore, the method upon which ATTAIN is based is not sufficiently targeted.  That is, more often than not, businesses have only 3-4 workplace processes or practices that need to be changed in order to increase the company's competitiveness.  The original method does not single these out as more important than other elements of the workplace.  To date,  increasing the effective incorporation of new technology by changing workplace practice and worker cognition through specialized simulation training, but not at identifying the most appropriate target for the technology implementation or change has been very successful.  The work of Phase II will involve integrating the current methods with those of another company.  Their method has been shown to identify the "vital few" practices that mitigate a company's overall competitive survival and which are the most appropriate targets for change.  Phase II has two goals.  First, a hybrid method that is quicker and more targeted will be developed.  Second, a practitioner training approach and supporting materials that make it possible for professionals without extensive experience to deliver the method in a high quality manner will be developed.

    Training and licensing practitioners in a hybrid method of workplace learning will contribute significantly to the problem of efficient and successful technology integration and implementation of new technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of an assessment tool that will enable users to profile a decision-maker's cognitive agility and expertise in high-level business situations. It is appropriate for evaluating decision makers in organizations and students who aspire to leadership roles.  This version of the product can also be self-administered.  It is based on results from recent basic research conducted by Workplace Technologies Research Inc. (WTRI) that revealed the cognitive mechanisms involved in the thinking of highly accomplished experts in business.  It uses knowledge elicitation technology that WTRI has developed over several years to support research on the identification of intuitive expertise (in the sense of Dreyfus 1997). The proposal outlines a plan to develop an on-line Internet based version that is self-scoring and tested among well-known experts.  The product will be field-tested for its ability to predict general vs. industry specific expertise.  The expected outcome is an easy to use tool for professional evaluators, professors, students or individuals, which will assist in staff development and education.  The profiles generated by the product will identify hidden strengths, areas of weakness, and suggestions for further development.  The long-term goal is distribution by recruiters, coaches, universities and consultancies.

    In the current climate of rapid workplace change, decision-makers need to continually evaluate their ability to adapt to changes and re-invent their organization's value and competitive future.  Few assessment tools address the cognitive underpinnings of the skill set involved.  Rather, they evaluate personal traits or sub-skills that have some correlation with leadership, broadly defined.  Using an empirically verified model of expertise in business strategy development and performance prediction, the research team at WTRI has built an assessment tool that locates an individual with regard to this model; much like chess players are evaluated against a notion of a Chess Grand Master.  When applied to individual client situations, this tool has been shown to have powerful predictive capability and thus has successfully informed staff development efforts.  Its distinctive feature is assessment of the ability to analyze disparate sources information in order to make strategy level decisions and supporting tactical plans.  Making the tool more widely available and usable by non-scientists could importantly contribute to efforts to increase the performance of both organizations and decision makers.  Organizations, distributors and several institutions of higher learning have expressed interest in this technology, which they consider to be addressing an area of unmet need.

    to enable users to develop expertise in Project Management in the context of emulated

    through experience with tough problems.  Teams of participants interact with virtual
    replicas of actual processes and products in the context of an ongoing business,
    with complex goals to accomplish.  The environments are enriched with embedded

    \ The objective for this project is to refine the approach for use with novices
    with the intention of accelerating the development of expertise in the key skills
    of project management that are normally learned through years of experience, and
    specifically, from failure.  The project will also resolve a number of questions
    about the key features at play within emerging Virtual Worlds platforms. \"Smart\"
    Virtual Worlds have the potential to provide an optimal opportunity for experiential

    current training methods. \n\nThe broader/commercial impact of accelerating the
    rate of developing project management expertise through no-risk experiential learning
    that is engineered for the development of complex skills in less time is nearly
    incalculable. Studies of expert project managers indicate that their skill was
    acquired over many years and as a result of learning by failure.  Therefore, even
    though the value of expert project managers is widely acknowledged, the cost and
    risk of getting that value is quite high and may simply take too long.  Further,
    the known risks involved in learning through failure prevent other project managers
    from ever becoming experts.  On the other hand,  the lack of expertise has costs
    of its own.  Some studies have estimated the organizational losses to upwards
    of $82 billion annually.  These losses are thought to be entirely preventable
    with better approaches to project management education.  Thus far, WTRI is one
    of the only companies that understands how to build \"smart\" Virtual Worlds for

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a dynamic modeling technology that helps manufacturers visualize the top and bottom line financial impact of changes made at the strategic, tactical and operational levels of a business.  WTRI has a long history of research and applications that work with the way that people become intuitive experts, the ways that experts use technologies and the cognitive triggers underlying shifts in cognitive frameworks and capabilities.  One of the intellectual merits of the proposed research is that it will further add to knowledge on how technologies extend complex cognitive capabilities in manufacturing settings.  This tool promises to address two well-known problems limiting manufacturing competitiveness: decision making rigidity (e.g., recipe driven solutions) and the inability to think simultaneously on strategic and tactical levels.  Currently, complex and difficult to use versions of these models exist and have proven successful when used by WTRI principals and maintained by the firm's technicians. The research will explore the core features of the technology that have made it successful.  It will result in the development of cost effective versions that can be easily used by customers and which can be modified to their business issues without extensive re-programming.

    The broader impacts of the technology have already been indicated by increased use of these models in client engagements with measurable success.  However, in their current form, the models are not easily used independently; that is, without the participation of WTRI, although demand for them is high.   Historically, the difficulty of anticipating the links between changes in execution and a financial impact at the bottom or top line has accounted for many change initiative failures.  These models enable manufacturers to examine hypotheses about the impact on strategic goals of changes in their organizations.  University programs also see that the tool may have pedagogic value in showing professionals how to think through the multi-level issues in manufacturing companies.  The models themselves may also add to our understanding of how the different levels and functions in an organization interact.  Often, specific between-level or between-function impacts are known, but the model promises to bring all the interactions together into one dynamic whole, exposing both hidden negative ripple effects and growth opportunities that would not be discovered otherwise.  Finally, this tool can be viewed as providing a way to make our value vdded resellers more effective with their clients and their businesses more successful.

    This SBIR Phase I project will culminate in an application which teaches beginners to compose their own music. Music is traditionally taught using physical instruments and sheet music, both of which are complex and present imposing financial and practical barriers to creativity. As a result, even though parents value music education highly and research has shown that studying music is beneficial to cognitive and emotional development, the majority of beginning music students drop out during the first year of instruction, before having a chance to express their creativity through music. By using mobile devices as modular teaching tools, the proposed solution will make composition accessible as a first step in learning music. Increasing creativity in beginning music education will decrease the dropout rate for people already studying music, and also make music education accessible for the millions of families nationwide who value music but cannot afford private lessons. By expanding a market for lessons that is already roughly $3 billion per year in the United States, this project has significant revenue and growth potential, in addition to increasing the accessibility and quality of education in the U.S. and worldwide.

    This project uses an intuitive gestural composition interface to make it possible for beginners to compose music visually and hear it played back in real time. By using simplified representative block notation, the proposed software makes composition accessible even to those with no knowledge of music notation and no experience on an instrument. Using a musical system based on music theory and arranging concepts, the complexity of music composition is reduced at the beginning to make a user's first compositions sound good to them, encouraging them to explore further. More complexity is gradually introduced through a scaffolded, project-based curriculum as users learn musical concepts through creative exploration and engaging games. This curriculum includes a gradual step-by-step transition between simplified block notation and full traditional music notation. The curriculum will be developed in two phases: 1) piloting a modular teaching tool that allows music teachers to increase the creativity and individualization of their assignments by incorporating composition into their teaching, and 2) developing an autonomous teaching tool for the consumer market that combines free creation with educational games to teach musical concepts with or without the aid of a teacher.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enhance the science content knowledge of elementary school pre-service and in-service teachers and increase their effectiveness in teaching science. Studies show significant deficiencies in many elementary teachers? conceptual knowledge of science topics, and this lack of scientific understanding inhibits their ability to teach science effectively. Research also shows that students learn more from teachers with strong comprehension of the subject matter being taught than from teachers with weak content understanding. Using research from cognitive psychology, game-based learning, and multimedia learning theory, this project creates problem-based scenarios and built-in assessments that challenge teachers to solve problems and ensures that they grasp scientific principles. By improving teachers? understanding of science, this project will therefore improve student performance and give students the foundational knowledge needed to pursue careers not only in science, but also in engineering and technology. Increasing the number of young people entering scientific and technical fields has an impact not only on the individuals entering these professional careers, but also on the nation?s productivity, competitiveness, and tax base since science and technology are key drivers of innovation and growth in the U.S. economy.

    The product is a Web-based learning system consisting of a suite of inquiry-based activities designed to (a) strengthen the science knowledge of pre-service and in-service elementary teachers and (b) increase their confidence in and enthusiasm for teaching science. To motivate the learner, the product includes an overarching science fiction narrative with engaging 3D art as well as game-based science learning activities. All science content aligns with The Next Generation Science Standards as well as curriculum focal points and provides learners with immediate and easily accessible data on their science understanding, both procedural and conceptual. Because learners become engaged by the narrative and interactive science experiments, they are less focused on the intervention as a teaching instrument and on their deficiencies in scientific understanding. During engagement, learners are carefully scaffolded through 6 levels of difficulty, and move up and down the levels seamlessly based on performance. Also, learners collect rewards along the way to further motivate them to engage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I innovation addresses deficiencies in science content knowledge exhibited by many elementary school teachers. Project Near-Earth Object is a game-based professional development product that teachers can also use as a self-assessment tool to evaluate their content knowledge in science. It uses interactive science experiments in the form of fast-paced mini-games to increase pre-service and in-service elementary teachers' ability to teach science topics. Research indicates that teacher competence in the content area greatly affects elementary students? interest in and success in science. The innovation relies not only on gaming, but also on a narrative in which players are "recruited" by a league of scientists to help Earth prepare for a pending asteroid collision; they must stop a villain determined to destroy the Earth's anti-asteroid defense. In the interactive science experiments, teachers: use simulations to gather information related to the problem; test hypotheses to solve to science problems; and collaborate using social networking.  The innovation uses computer-adapted differentiated instruction, meaning that each mini-game has six levels of difficulty and the computer adapts difficulty levels according to the learner's performance. Other features include scaffolding of instruction, instant feedback, video tutorials, mobile access, and a backend administrative dashboard for viewing performance data.

    The broader/commercialization impact of Project Near-Earth Object lies in its unique design and large but targeted market niche. There is no direct competition for this product. Project Near-Earth Object is the only intervention on the market that is a science learning game for teachers, available on both Web and mobile platforms, aligned with recognized national standards, featuring a community-based social component, and an easy-to-use dashboard for viewing and tracking performance. There are approximately 3 million teachers and 1200 teacher education programs in the U.S., and demand for elementary teachers is growing. Research indicates that elementary teacher interest and subject matter knowledge in science is low. Teachers recognize that content knowledge is essential for good teaching.  99% of elementary teachers say that performance evaluations should include knowledge of subject matter. This game can be easily integrated into existing teacher training curricula or offered as a stand-alone professional development product. Its scalable online design is conducive to distribution through multiple channels and to competitive pricing structures. Project Near-Earth Object can significantly impact teacher understanding of science content and more importantly how to "do science," which will contribute to better attitudes about science and ultimately to better teachers in the classroom.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the *mobile platform that offers a radically new alternative to enterprises for application mobilization. The platform enables mobilization without requiring any software development, mobilizes applications instantaneously, offers a uni&#64257;ed mobilization platform for all of an enterprise?s applications, and enables feature parity controllable by the enterprise. Offered as a cloud-based service, enterprises can non-intrusively adopt &#8727;mobile to rapidly mobilize applications. At the heart of the &#8727;mobile platform is an innovative mobile remote computing protocol (MRCP). &#8727;mobile achieves instantaneous mobilization by allowing the desktop version of the application to be run on a cloud backend, and then using MRCP for intelligently and dynamically interfacing the desktop version with a custom viewer on the mobile device. MRCP performs dynamic transformations both in the downstream - where the transformation is applied to the view presented to the user, and in the upstream - where the transformation is applied to the user actions that need to be delivered back to the application. The transformations are performed in an application agnostic fashion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will benefit the 85% of enterprise knowledge workers who are expected to have smartphones within the next few years (source: J. Gold Assoc., 2011). A recent survey of CIOs revealed that there are multiple drivers for application mobilization - the key ones being increased productivity of employees, higher revenue, and reduced paper work. Not surprisingly, over 90% of IT managers in a recent survey indicated plans for application mobilization (source: Sybase Survey, 2011). Typical customers for &#8727;mobile include any fortune 1000 large enterprise, medium-sized businesses, and small-medium (SMB) businesses that use applications for business processes. While there is a strong and deep need for application mobilization, there exists no universal, cost-effective solution that can perform mobilization rapidly. The current market is highly fragmented with no universal, cost effective, and rapid mobilization solutions available. Thus, there is a need for a solution that can achieve rapid mobilization with minimal effort on the part of the enterprise and at the same time provide the rich set of functionality that the enterprise requires.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to understand the fundamental visual cues and characteristics of plants found in agricultural facilities for the purpose of rapid automated identification of plant species. The human eye, coupled with the brain?s processing power , can readily distinguish between different plant species. This capability was one of the basic needs for humans to become an agrarian society (farming requires weeding), which helped start enormous social advancement. Similarly, to bring automated systems to the next generation of capability, computer vision must interact with the natural world with greater fidelity. Today?s computer vision has ability to detect a ?splotch? of vegetation versus no vegetation. This project will advance computer vision by developing the equipment and software algorithms necessary to automatically distinguish plant types. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that can automatically and reliably identify a known crop versus a foreign plant (i.e. weed) for use in a larger system for automated weeding. By creating the ability for computers to distinguish between plant types, we will enable food to be grown with reduced amounts of chemical herbicides.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of vegetable farms, particularly organic ones, while improving human health and the environment. Today, organic farms represent 5% of the U.S. agricultural economy and are growing at a pace to double organic acreage every 4 years. A key feature of organic farming is the lack of herbicides. Consequently, organic farms are normally weeded by hand. Weed control represents approximately 50% of operating costs for organic farms, compared to less than 10% for conventional ones. With an estimated $700M spent annually on weeding organic farms, there is a substantial commercial opportunity to create a system that can weed farms automatically. This project will develop a system that uses a computer system towed behind a tractor to automatically detect and eliminate weeds at early plant stages. The system can be developed and deployed at less than 1/5 the life-cycle costs of hand weeding. The technology is also applicable to conventional crop thinning where it can significantly reduce the amount of herbicides used. Additionally this technology has a profound health and sustainability benefits by eliminating human exposure to chemical herbicides through food and avoids herbicides leaching into the soil.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a proof-of-concept
    prototype of a high-throughput agile tile mosaic manufacturing system. Mosaics have proven to be a
    great source of visual splendor for thousands of years. Despite its prominence in art and architecture,
    mosaic is arduous to design and assemble by hand. The goal of this Phase I work is to prove the
    feasibility of a programmable high-throughput multi-head robotic tile assembly system to enhance the
    production agility of mosaic tilings. Research innovation in Phase I will merge the benefits of parallel
    tile placement with robust high-capacity tile cartridges to radically decrease tile mosaic fabrication time
    and associated tile mosaic assembly costs. The measurable objective of Phase I is a 5x increase in
    production throughput over current state-of-the-art mosaic manufacturing technology, while enhancing
    tile placement accuracy. The system will be capable of producing both template and ?mass customized?
    mosaics. In Phase II, the prototype will be refined into a commercial grade system, integrated with an
    Enterprise Resource Planning system, and placed into service in Artaic?s production environment.
    Successful Phase I/II demonstration will significantly lower the time and cost for manufacturing mosaics
    and potentially revolutionize the $76B global tile industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project goes beyond art, design, and architecture.
    Robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaic and increase its societal impact in adorning public,
    commercial, and residential spaces. The proposed research, if successful, will have a significant impact
    on agile manufacturing. It will allow penetration into unforeseen markets by reducing the cost of highthroughput flexible assembly. The solution proposed by the research will be immediately applicable to
    customers and partners, and potentially useful in parallel industries such as medical, pharmaceutical, food, consumer products, and others that will benefit from robotic agile manufacturing enabled mass customization. Agile mosaic manufacturing capability could revitalize the U.S. tile manufacturing industry and create job opportunities. The investigators estimate that a 5x production rate increase will enable a breakthrough price of $19.99, 75% lower than the competition, and for the first time achieve broad market affordability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a comprehensive software toolkit for creating digital mosaic artwork. Mosaics have proven to be a great source of visual splendor for thousands of years. Despite their prominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble by hand. The goal of this Phase I project is to build and test software tools to automate production of digital mosaic artwork. After integration with robotic assembly in Phase II, the proposed automation will significantly lower the time and cost for designing and manufacturing mosaic artwork.  In Phase I, Artaic proposes to combine two leading methodologies for digital tile layout - procedural and optimization-based algorithms - to closely mimic the workflow of mosaic artists. Artists will sketch curves to denote perceptually important edges along which the tiles should be oriented, while algorithms will determine tile placement in response to user-defined parameters, rendering styles, and composition rules

    If successful, this work will have broad commercial potential in art, design, and architecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional societal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. This will also have spillover benefits, including growing use of this artform in advertising, entertainment, and visual effects.  The ultimate goal of Artaic is to leverage this software with custom robotics to create physical mosaics. This will enable Artaic to expand into a multi-billion dollar market and grow a domestic workforce. The fact that there is a software outlet for this work in addition to a proven commercial market for large-scale physical output adds to the case for the advancement of the proposed research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will pursue the development of a novel design architecture for recovering exhaust waste heat energy from an internal combustion engine by converting heat into electricity.  As vehicles become increasingly electrified, recovering a fraction of such heat by generating significant electrical power would off-load the vehicle alternator and substantially increase fuel economy.  The proposed innovation uniquely combines the latest advances in component technologies from fields in thermal management and energy conversion, resulting in a thermo-mechanical system that promises to be reliable, compact, and scalable while ?scavenging? significant power efficiently.  The research objectives include the preliminary design of a full-scale system and the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype.  Based upon results, the feasibility of the TEG system design will be ascertained, and its commercial viability evaluated more fully.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to recover a significant portion of the massive amounts of energy that is not utilized in our society but rejected in the form of waste heat from energy/power systems.  Exhaust heat rejected to the environment from internal combustion engines continues to be a significant untapped source of energy, representing over 40 percent of the available energy in these engines.  Most markets which utilize IC engines involve mobile or portable power such as automotive vehicles and military portable generators, requiring increasingly higher performance, efficiency, and reliability within a more compact and lightweight design ? key metrics addressed by the proposed innovation.  While reducing energy consumption in these applications, the innovation also reduces emissions since less fuel is consumed, helping companies meet stricter emission standards -- most notably the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ) standards which impose high financial penalties for non-compliance.   Other adjacent markets include stationary power generation, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially aircraft propulsion systems.  In addition to meeting market need, the proposed design approach contributes technically towards new or improved system design methodologies and catalyzing system-level innovation ? a particular need in the area of automotive exhaust waste heat recovery.

    Highly Efficient Solid State Transformer, Enabling Grid Modernization'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove the feasibility of a low-dose 4D cone beam tomosynthesis reconstruction algorithm for use in medical image-guided interventions. Despite the availability of highly accurate 3D guidance systems, most image-guided interventions are still performed under 2D fluoroscopy. 3D guidance is significantly more complex and expensive, as it requires the combination of 3D imaging (like CT) with surgical navigation, both expensive and complex technologies. A system capable of reconstructing a 4D scene would provide accurate and easy to use guidance for the medical professional, at lower costs. This research will develop a 3D reconstruction algorithm with quasi real-time performance (4D) that does not increase exposure to x-rays when compared to 2D fluoroscopy. The proposed technology will combine the most recent advancements in tomosynthesis, iterative reconstruction and compressed sensing and fundamentally change image-guided interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that advanced medical procedures, like minimally invasive surgery, will be significantly improved in workflow and accessibility, reducing healthcare costs, improving outcomes and improving quality of life for patients. In the U.S. alone, a 10% shift to minimally invasive spine surgeries can reduce healthcare costs by $180M while reducing patient trauma and providing faster recoveries to 45,000 patients. This technology could be applied in other clinical areas like oncology and interventional radiology, improving a broad array of procedures and bringing a new level of excellence in medical interventions. 4D systems would compete in the intra-operative x-ray medical imaging market, a $1B market that is growing 6% annually, and in the Surgical Navigation market, a $400M market that is growing 9% annually. The proposed concept has the potential to disrupt both these markets by replacing pairs of intra-operative 3D imaging and surgical navigation systems with one 4D system that is more cost effective and easier to use.

    focused on the development of novel methods for ideation and innovation through
    the discovery of lateral connections in otherwise unconnected knowledge networks.
    In many fields of human knowledge and activity, a common feature is that information
    content is expanding at such a rate that finding relevant results to searches
    for solutions is becoming increasingly difficult. A further problem is that even
    the high quality material is expanding at such a rate that most disciplines are
    rapidly forming sub-disciplines. As fields continue to both expand both at the
    top levels in terms of overall amount of knowledge, and to expand at the more
    granular levels by fragmentation into ever more numerous subfields, each of which
    may develop its own journals, conferences and even terminology, impenetrable to
    the outsider. It's becoming impossible to stay current. Yet much of creativity
    occurs, and indeed a great many of the world?s great inventions have occurred,
    precisely at the intersections between different fields. The central objective
    of this Phase I project will be to determine the utility of a parsable ontology
    for supporting ideation and innovation by connecting diverse knowledge domains.
    \   \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans multiple
    fields and markets, including but not limited to pharmaceuticals, medical devices,
    materials science, semiconductor devices, chemical processing, legal discovery,
    patent analyses, and financial analytics. In each of these fields, there is often
    an increase in 'silo-ing' of different knowledge domains, with the development
    of access and language barriers in between them, presenting clear challenges to
    academia and industry. As this situation worsens, there is need of ever better
    ways to organize, translate and present information to users, and to find solutions
    to users' problems (their 'unmet needs'). What is needed, and not yet offered
    by any competitor, is an exploration system giving searchers a strong serendipitous
    element with a maximum likelihood of results having come from a diverse, unexpected,
    and potentially provocative source. This will break down silos by providing a
    rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different disciplines to
    facilitate the ready spread of awareness of a potential solution from one field
    to another, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. The initial customer focus
    will be on particular corporate clients with a heavy investment in R&D activities
    and a high probability of internal silo-ing of knowledge, such as pharmaceutical
    companies."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is clear from the size of the market in warehousing and logistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the annual cost of moving inventory by hand in warehouses is 5 billion dollars. Industry is eager to adopt new robotic technology, and it has already made a significant impact in many aspects of this problem, speeding shipments and lowering costs. However, handling individual items has not yet proven viable when the range of objects is large. The grasping robot developed in this project will meet this need, and reduce the cost of logistics for manufacturers, distributors, and customers. Additionally, the creation of robot grasping systems that can automatically grasp a wide range of objects will open up the benefits of robotic technology to workers in other industries. This is critical to making robots accessible to small manufacturing shops, and will significantly improve the performance of telepresence systems used for military, rescue, and consumer applications such as home assistance for the elderly.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is based on a decade of university research on the design and construction of robots for grasping using passive mechanisms. Through the carefully tuned structural compliance of the fingers, robot hands can be designed to compensate for variation in the size, shape and location of grasped objects to obtain reliable grasps. During the course of this project, a commercial product will be developed capable of picking and placing a wide range of items at extremely low error rates, something that has hitherto been considered a hard problem in sensing and planning. The new compliant grippers, combined with breakthroughs in low-cost tactile sensing and simplified grasp planning, will enable a level of performance that meets the needs of real-world customers. The new picking robot will be validated against a set of realistic items picked from bins in a simulated warehouse environment.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific
    need for historical and most current satellite data for visualization and analytical
    purposes with regional-to-global coverage, frequent revisit, and high spatial
    detail at an affordable price. It will allow companies to improve their value

    and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology.
    Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential
    in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia
    and industry and improving datasets for research and education. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical
    feasibility of operationally synthesizing accurate global, high spatial / high
    temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The complexity of accessing, processing,
    and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier
    to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial and high
    temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences
    in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to
    account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution
    imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations
    which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The proposed technology
    will overcome these limitations by implementing advanced data fusion algorithms
    to combine various sources of satellite data to synthesize imagery for any given
    date and location while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of
    the data sources. The algorithms will be robust, easily automated, scalable, deliver
    accurate data, are usable in operational settings, and will provide spatially
    consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with
    regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it could dramatically increase the efficiency
    of communication networks. The ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally
    route traffic on data networks is expected to lead to network cost savings of
    60% - 70% for network service providers. The project leverages the recent industry
    shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to address a
    $35 billion market by 2018. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the
    promised performance benefits of better traffic control. The company plans to
    capitalize on this market shift by implementing its optimized, dynamic and adaptive
    traffic control algorithms in SDN-controlled data networks. The resulting social
    impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust
    data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will
    enable rapid innovation in networking, leading to new network applications that
    have not yet been envisioned. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms
    that can unlock the full capacity of modern communication networks. Today, due
    to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in efficient

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create custom crafted voices for text-to-speech
    applications that empower recipients to engage in conversation and be heard in
    his/her own voice.  The company's technology blends a recipient's residual vocal
    abilities and a matched donor's speech database to craft a personalized voice
    that combines the recipient's vocal identity with the clarity of the donor's speech.
    In the United States alone, there are over 2.5 million individuals with speech
    impairment and 3-5 million individuals with low vision who rely on a limited set
    of generic, mechanical sounding voices for assisted communication. It is not uncommon
    for several children in a classroom or adults in a workplace to use the same synthetic
    voice. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that conveys our age, gender, race,
    size, and personality. Until now, this variety and flexibility of voice has not
    been afforded to users of speech synthesis technology. The company's goal is to
    give the gift of voice to all those who need and want it to enhance how they learn,
    work and play.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
    aims to engineer personalized synthetic voices that convey the recipient's unique
    vocal identity. The company's innovation is grounded in the source-filter theory
    of speech production which divides the speech signal into a source component (the
    vocal folds) and a filter component (the rest of the vocal tract) that are largely
    independent. Because source and filter characteristics both contribute to speaker
    identity, the key challenge is to create an authentic, yet understandable voice
    by extracting as much identity information from recipient vocalizations as possible
    and combining it with speech clarity information from the donor. Standard voice
    conversion methods require large amounts of spoken data from donors and recipients
    as well as parallel corpora, which are not available for the target applications.
    This Phase I work will make significant advances toward the design and implementation
    of a novel automated voice matching and transformation process that leverages
    a large database of healthy donors' speech to generate personalized synthetic
    voices from sparse samples of target recipients' vocalizations. Algorithms will
    be validated using both quantitative and perceptual metrics to assess intelligibility,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of tools that democratize a new interactive medium called projection mapping. Projection mapping uses video projectors to overlay digital content (images, animations or video) onto 3D physical objects, allowing viewers to experience and interact with digital experiences in an entirely new way. These interactive displays will add value to a wide range of industries where dynamic, 3D presentations are needed to inform, educate, advertise or entertain. Applications include educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, new training and simulation displays, as well as broad uses in advertising and entertainment. For example, a retail end aisle display could more easily attract customers by demonstrating product features with projected light directly on or around the physical product. Alternatively, an interactive diorama in a museum could allow visitors to learn history through an immersive visual experience. This project will bring projection mapping from high budget, niche markets into low budget, mainstream markets. Cost reductions will be realized through technological advances that decrease design, setup and calibration requirements, which in turn will advance technological capabilities and content authoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel software and hardware system for authoring projection mapping content. The proposed system will greatly simplify a currently complex content authoring process, and will enable entirely new passive and interactive experiences which fuse digital content with the physical environment. The system is comprised of a content authoring software suite and a projector-depth camera hardware unit capable of high-resolution 3D scanning. Research objectives entail novel software algorithms in the areas of 1) automatic calibration of projector-camera systems, 2) optimized structured light scanning of 3D objects, 3) automatic, precise re-alignment and registration of the system in response to movement of the physical model, 4) intuitive authoring tools for creating passive and interactive projection mapping experiences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to greatly improve the robustness and diagnosability of many real world cloud computing infrastructures. The proposed technology will significantly reduce the downtime of production cloud systems, which can attract more users to adopt cloud computing technology and thus benefit the expanding segment of society and the economy that depends on cloud technology. The project will also advance the state of the art of cloud system reliability research by putting research results into real world use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform system anomaly management for production cloud computing infrastructures. The novelty of the company's solution lies in three unique features: 1) it provides automatic multivariate anomaly detection that can enable high-fidelity anomaly alerts without imposing any configuration burden on the user; 2) it provides early anomaly alerts before big system problems occur; and 3) it provides anomaly diagnosis that can generate hints on why an anomaly occurs. The proposed research will produce novel and practical anomaly prediction and diagnosis solutions that will be validated in real world cloud infrastructures. Specifically, the project consists of two thrusts: 1) online multivariate anomaly prediction that explores new light-weight unsupervised learning algorithms for achieving high-fidelity anomaly alerts and providing time-to-failure estimations; and 2) automatic anomaly diagnosis that can identify possible causes of an anomaly to greatly expedite the anomaly troubleshooting process in the cloud. The company will implement the software products and carry out case studies with partners on real world cloud computing infrastructures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that was not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process the data under the explicit control of the user.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing the interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity with lower cost and lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions.  The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include real-time distributed video and image processing, genome sequencing and mining of any unstructured Big Data.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The in-situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move the data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost TLC/3D-TLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computations directly on the data with the addition of specialized in-situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.  To make this disruptive solution as non-invasive as possible, a level of system software is needed to make adoption as seamless as possible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility and commercial potential of developing software technologies that enable disaster recovery and high availability for cloud-based web applications and mobile app back-ends (apps). The innovations address the key pain points associated with public cloud use as revealed by interviews conducted as part of the NSF I-Corps program: disruption, privacy, and lock-in.  The project plan is to design, develop, and empirically evaluate the utility, scale, and commercial potential of cutting edge proprietary software products that automate and make migration and failover easy for app developers that employ cloud-based services to implement their apps.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from its ability to benefit a wide constituency.  On the commercial side, cloud and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) markets are growing at an alarming pace. This project is unique in that it combines the benefits of modern cloud platforms with the key missing pieces of all extant approaches to PaaS:  disaster recovery, easy migration, and hybrid cloud use by apps and data across public and on-premise deployment options. The simplification enabled by this cloud platform with a disaster recovery solution lowers the barrier to entry and reduces both the risk and cost associated with public cloud use.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is considerable because a variety of complementary
    new technologies is ushering in a new era in which visual messages are becoming
    a first-class media type along-side text and speech.  Today, both amateur and
    professional videographers still have to enter the virtual darkroom to sift through
    video, edit it, and produce engaging content.  Video creation is waiting for its
    Polaroid moment, when a technological solution will transform the post-production
    time required to create engaging video.  If successful, the technology developed
    in this project will greatly increase the utility of any video capture device
    and would have implications outside of Internet media in areas such as life recording
    and knowledge transfer. The countless video clips of important or memorable events
    that are today commonly archived and forgotten could instead be automatically
    summarized and made available in a usable and engaging format. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to evaluate the technical
    viability of an automatic video summarization system based on neural networks
    and adapted to measurements of human psychology.  As people collectively record
    more videos than they can possibly consume (the video deluge problem), a technology
    that automatically turns raw videos into relevant and engaging summaries becomes
    increasingly critical.  The company's proposed platform would streamline video
    sharing, search, and viewing, all of which are staples of our online lives.  Scientifically
    we are at a unique time in the capabilities of artificial visual systems, with
    some systems rivaling human performance in limited domains.  Furthermore, the
    field of visual psychology has also seen recent progress in relating visual semantic
    information to cognitive phenomena, like memorability of images.  Taken together,
    it may now be possible to automatically predict the cognitive relevance of visual
    information and produce effective video summarizations.  This project combines
    deep neural networks for visual object recognition, recurrent networks for contextually
    embedded temporal information, and user measurement of interest, memorability,
    and uniqueness.  The primary technical objective is to determine whether a system
    can automatically predict human-produced video summarizations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will offer the automotive industry higher reliability from the software systems powering automobiles, by enabling runtime monitoring while providing the maximum possible correctness guarantees for the generated monitors.  Cars will be safer and more rigorously assured.  This project will address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that occur inevitably as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of vehicles safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.  The commercial value follows the need of manufacturers to retain the basic vehicle safety guarantees while pursuing the commercial necessities of competing on complex software-driven features, ultimately minimizing software development costs and expensive car recalls.  The enhanced scientific and technological understanding from this technology will come as it is deployed in the field, giving manufacturers an impetus to formalize and standardize existing requirements, bolstering their understanding of the software systems in the car.  The technology will also foster the formalization of both open and proprietary specifications, further increasing the understanding of complex automotive systems by facilitating complete analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will for the first time explore the application of provably correct runtime verification software to real-time systems.  An efficient and certifying framework allowing for the expression of a diverse range of specifications will enable applications of runtime verification in automobiles, aeronautics, and beyond.  One research objective is to develop a system that can monitor any safety property, generating high-performance C code capable of running on virtually any hardware.  This will combine efficient monitoring with maximal formal guarantees in terms of correctness.  Formal verification was previously realized only for mathematical models of monitors, or in systems with very low expressiveness.  A second research objective is to study the applicability of runtime verification by collecting properties from automotive industry standards, evaluating the complexity of specifying the properties, the possibility of recovering from detected violations, and the performance requirements of the resulting monitors. It is anticipated that hundreds or even thousands of such properties will be monitored simultaneously.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an efficient remote monitoring and diagnostic software system to detect and diagnose software defects in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs have the potential to bring about a revolution in efficiency, robustness, and safety in application domains such as smart utility grids and smart health care. To unleash their potential, CPSs must themselves be robust. However, despite state-of-the-art testing, software defects currently do escape into deployed CPSs. Current state-of-practice monitoring and diagnostic systems cannot improve the situation as they were not designed with the constraints of CPSs in mind, which include real-time execution, unreliable links, and resource constrained processors. The proposed technology is aimed at creating a software system capable of monitoring embedded nodes in CPSs for anomalies and providing detailed execution information to quickly diagnose the software defects responsible for any anomalies. The proposed work extends the company's extensive research in efficient collection of information for diagnosing software defects. The company expects to create a prototype monitoring and diagnostic software system for CPSs and demonstrate its effectiveness on existing software defects in CPSs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project derives from the fact that increasing the reliability and robustness of CPSs will directly increase their adoption in real world applications. CPS technology is directly applicable to a broad range of sectors, including utility grids, smart buildings, manufacturing, health care, transportation, etc. These sectors account for more than $32.3 trillion in economic activity, with the potential to grow to $82 trillion by 2025 - about one half of the global economy. CPSs are thus critical to the national interest in areas such as manufacturing competitiveness, defense, health care, energy production and usage, and disaster monitoring and recovery. Due to the increasing reliance on CPSs in the future, system defects could have drastic consequences. The proposed technology could significantly improve reliability of CPSs by catching defects before they result in significant loss, outages, or failures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower farmers to capture a greater share of revenue from the marketing of their crops.  Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas.  Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain.  This project develops a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions.  An addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by the platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs.  Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a  novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions.   The project bundles a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data.  These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management.   Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future.  A research objective will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast.  This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated ensemble-based parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of three major pieces.  First is the reduction of musculoskeletal injuries for manual laborers, which already affects 600,000 workers each year. This will improve the quality of life of laborers, since an injury at work affects both their work life and their personal life.  Second is to reduce the high costs associated to these injuries that need to be paid by employers, and which are estimated to be $15.2bn a year. These costs challenge the competitiveness of these companies.  Thirdly, the worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the feasibility of automatically evaluating the risk of musculoskeletal injury in the workplace using smart wearable devices. These injuries affect hundreds of thousands of workers per year in the US, and cost US companies more than $15bn in direct costs. This research goal depends on the achievement of two technical objectives (i) to prove that the sensors and developed algorithms can differentiate lifting events from other worker activities, and (ii) to demonstrate that the data collected by the sensors can be used to accurately predict the output of the NIOSH lifting equation, an ergonomics risk model widely accepted in industry. Estimations of the outputs of the equation performed by our device will be compared by those computed manually by a certified ergonomist. These wearable devices can quantify the risk of musculoskeletal injuries continuously over time, providing a deeper understanding of the factors that affect risk and the ability to take measures to reduce that risk before an injury occurs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be on the Real Estate Industry, specifically targeted at the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments through Smart Home Automation. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. The MFH industry will participate through additional charges to the residents for smart home automation support. However, the bigger increase in revenue will most likely come from better data and insights on their buildings which leads to opportunities to monetize that data and sell software targeted at MFH buildings. In addition to increased revenue, there is potential to save costs through more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio.  The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry.  In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The issue is that all the devices could easily be paired but to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment is the challenge. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is that a proof of concept will be developed that gives directional guidance on the best way to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent need for real-time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of this innovative technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. This includes nuclear power industry workers, national lab staff, and homeland security personnel, all of whom need to detect the presence of neutron-emitting radioactive materials and assess the health physics risks in real time.  This multi-billion dollar market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for wearable neutron dosimeters and detectors are currently less well developed.  The proposed technology closes this gap and thus addresses new commercial opportunities across a targeted array of markets: in addition to supporting U.S. technology leadership and safer low-carbon nuclear energy generation, this project will explore new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the feasibility of a novel compact, wearable neutron detector/dosimeter based solely on solid-state technology. Research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation, evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics, and gamma discrimination. This will be the first detector of its kind, enabling portability, low cost, real time signal capability and complete integration with semiconductor microdevice technology.  The novel device concept combines a directional optical converter (neutrons to secondary electrons to light) with state-of-the-art optoelectronic detection to provide a digital output which is compatible with wireless reporting protocols and internet integration.  The proposed device can therefore be reconfigured for many radiation detection tasks that are currently not feasible with larger, bulky devices using conventional gas proportional and scintillator detector technology.  The anticipated result is a novel disruptive neutron detection approach.   The research to be performed at the forefront of neutron detection science includes a thorough evaluation of the neutron-capture process, and aims for the first time to better understand the radiation response of a high density of large capture cross-section nuclei in a high-purity optical medium.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable various low latency video applications that are not possible today.  One of the most interesting is in the area of cloud computing, in which a server in a data center somewhere on the Internet runs a client's application remotely, and delivers the frame-by-frame video to the client's viewer.  This allows for a very cheap client device, consisting of just a video decoder and an input such as a mouse pad, while graphic or compute intensive tasks run on powerful servers in the cloud that can be leased to the client on an as-needed basis.  This server-client model could also be used internally at a company or school, greatly simplifying IT requirements.  And for high security applications there is also an advantage, as all data is stored remotely.  There is nothing local on the user's device to be compromised.  Cloud computing services such as these are already coming on line, but the range of applications they can run is limited by the lack of good low latency video encoding.  Solving this problem opens up a whole new paradigm of how people purchase, maintain and use personal computers and software.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates techniques for real-time ultra low latency video compression.  The goal of the research is to enable the encoding and transmission of video over a communications medium such as the Internet, cell phone network, satellite network, etc. such that the video may be viewed at the receiving end with no more than 1 frame of latency from when it was encoded at the source.  The best and newest industry-standard video compression specification, called H.265, will be used as a framework such that the resulting compressed video can be readily decoded by widely available software or hardware.  Framework tools and techniques to monitor and adjust the bit rate of the compressed video will be developed and tested to achieve the low latency goals while maintaining high visual quality of the compressed video.  The result of this research will be a set of algorithms that can be used in the design of an H.265 video encoder that will achieve the low latency goal, as well as a characterization of the limitations of these algorithms such that their applicability to various real-world opportunities can be assessed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a substantially more effective and efficient error correction scheme for flash memory than exists today. This will provide better reliability and extend the life of flash memory and will have a major impact on several technologies and markets such as enterprise storage at data centers, solid state drives, tablets, smart phones, and other consumer electronics. The flash memory market was estimated to include $30.1 billion in production and sales in 2013 and is expected to grow to $43.9 billion by 2018. The enterprise storage market is estimated to be $1 billion in 2014 and a robust growth is expected over the next few years. A substantial fraction of this market is related to error correction controllers for flash memories which are playing an even more important goal than ever considering the rapid scaling down and increasing capacities of flash memories which introduce more read errors than before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address and develop tools to overcome problems that have traditionally prevented low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from being deployed in flash memories  and error correction controllers. A major problem is that these codes have error floors which prevent them from achieving very low error probabilities required in flash memories. In order to overcome this deficiency, new algorithms will be developed to understand the nature of the problem and to eliminate it using advanced signal processing methods. Area and energy efficient decoder technologies will be developed that make LDPC codes suitable for flash applications. This will include research optimizing LDPC based error correction systems for area and energy efficiency and elimination of the error floor problem. It will also include research on optimizing the detailed circuit design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce and establish the foundations of a new class of electronic products - ultra-thin electronic devices embedded in thin, flexible, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly substrates such as common paper. The ultra-thin embedded electronics offer superior cost, flexibility, reliability, and security characteristics relative to conventional flexible electronics. The most significant applicable market for such products in the near term is that for Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)-based devices. In 2014, shipments of passive RFID tags will approach 7 billion having a value of about $3.5 billion and an annual growth rate of about 25%. However, the application of the ultra-thin embedded electronics technology extends well beyond RFID.  It encompasses both defense and commercial applications within the general category of flexible hybrid electronics. Examples of defense applications include wearable health monitors, disposable sensors, embedded sensors with communication capability for monitoring equipment and structural health, etc. Examples of commercial applications are counterfeit-proof 'smart' security, legal, and financial documents, wearable and disposable electronics, interactive media, and intelligent product packaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to study the feasibility of embedding ultra-thin electronic devices in thin flexible materials such as paper. Paper has been considered extensively as a substrate material for printed electronics. However, embedding ultra-thin, silicon-based flexible electronic devices inside paper during the paper making process has not been researched. Similarly, an extensive body of knowledge exists on the topic of device reliability. However, current research is almost entirely focused on the interconnection system between the chip and circuit board and on the situations where the entire device is subjected to cyclic thermal and/or mechanical stresses. Embedding hybrid electronic devices in thin flexible materials requires the semiconductor chips to be extremely thin, less than 50 microns and preferably about 20-25 microns thick.  This is significantly thinner than the conventional chips. Still, no research has exclusively considered the survivability of such chips and the entire embedded electronic device under the stress and strain conditions typical for the paper making process. The results from this study will pave the path to developing ultra-thin electronic devices embedded in other thin flexible materials such as polymers, composites, and synthetic paper.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the treatment and decrease the high costs associated with treating patients who suffer severe traumatic brain injuries. This project aims to develop an accurate, affordable (<$100 per use) and non-invasive device to monitor a patient?s intracranial pressure following traumatic brain injury. Increased intracranial pressure can result in serious condition or death, if left untreated. However, the only available method to monitor intracranial pressure is expensive (~$10,000 per patient) and requires neurosurgery. The lack of a method to accurately screen patients to determine who needs surgery results in misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in about 46% of patients among an estimated 50,000 patients in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally. Successful commercialization of product is expected to result in savings in the range $250 million ever year to the US healthcare system.

    The proposed project will test the feasibility of developing a non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring method for use outside of the neuro ICU. To develop an accurate, affordable, and non-invasive ICP monitoring device, the team will first write and validate a software framework that analyzes Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFV) waveforms. CBFV waveforms are acquired non-invasively by using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. In order to use CBFVs to predict ICP, two novel signal-processing methods will be developed. First, the high noise levels typical to TCD-acquired waveforms will be reduced within a machine-learning framework. Second, we will use a method to track morphological features that predict ICP from the CBFV waveform. Both these approaches to signal processing to analyze CBFV waveforms are entirely novel. This approach is expected to allow for accurate (>92% of area under the diagnostic ROC) non-invasive real time monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement limits for TCD procedures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments leads to inefficiencies that result in extreme patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected in emergency departments, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist emergency departments in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve emergency department efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 emergency departments in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a decision-support platform upon which emergency departments will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will create a software platform, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments. This project will involve 1) understanding the capacity and real-time availability of data in emergency rooms, 2) developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform that maximizes the potential of these data, in real-time, and specifically reflects emergency departments, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery in an emergency department.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes ? even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.


    The proposed project tackles problems arising from low-throughput targeted detection technologies such as PCR, hybridization arrays, and culture. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The proposed research objectives are related to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. The ultimate goal is to develop, standardize and validate our metagenomics pathogen identification platform for use in agricultural detection and biosurveillance contexts, using aquaculture related fish species and their infectious agents as a relevant application. This project  proposes to: 1) characterize relative performance of sequencing platforms for pathogen identification; 2) validate and benchmark our agricultural detection platform using fish samples and spike-ins diagnosed using established methods; and 3) evaluate the use of host gene expression signatures as supporting evidence for infection. The team will obtain metagenomic sequence data from infected fish, compare their analysis results against current methods, and establish the limit of detection using known quantities of pathogenic material.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project, if successful, will be improving healthcare patient
    outcomes, potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug
    Quality and Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile
    injectable compounded medications that have closed the operations of many third
    party suppliers, thus creating drug shortages and higher prices.  In response,
    the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists expects 40% of the US market, 2000
    hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.  Hospitals that insource hope
    to decrease their costs and improve patient safety with higher quality product.
    \ Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple information systems and use
    paper records cobbling together how a compound is made and to whom it has been
    administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs, hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours
    identifying the problem source and affected patients. To prevent further patient
    risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase I project will provide hospitals the
    capability of an end-to-end quality management that will track every production
    process step and tracing medications to patients.  Hospitals will be able to prevent
    patients from receiving recalled medications and identify quality production compromises
    thus improving patient outcomes and potentially saving lives.  \n\nThe proposed
    project is a novel medication barcoded label encryption technology compatible
    with existing hospital scanners.   Key objectives include a new use of barcode
    standards, a proprietary encryption algorithm, and a method to send and extract
    secure serial code to and from Electronic Health Record (EHR) providers.  Today,
    healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with minimal
    embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels could be
    the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However, existing
    solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.  The
    project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded label
    connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually to the
    patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental conditions,
    and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication labels
    and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data.  The encryption and
    extraction method must not require special handling or software by the EHR.  Success
    of this project will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval
    of the serialized data from the EHR."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes innovations in data mining and the treatment of autism.  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is the gold standard in treating autism.  Applying data analytics to data from ABA therapy sessions will contribute in several important ways:  a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) patterns may be matched with other data, such as genomic data, to identify cross-patterns that may be useful in better understanding autism and ways to improve therapy; and c) the frontiers of data mining will be expanded to provide guidance in real time. This project will have the following societal impacts: 1) many more individuals with autism across the globe will receive early, quality, cost-effective treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced.

    The proposed project is to extract informative sequential patterns from trial sequences of an individual student, use them to accurately predict trial outcomes, and utilize the predictive model to provide individualized recommendations about how to modify trials and steps of student training. To achieve this goal, predictive data mining will be used. To develop accurate predictive models, the project will build on a large body of recent work in machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring. Specific key objectives include: 1) Representation of Trial Data for Predictive Modeling: how to represent the raw sequential data in a way that is most suitable for prediction modeling; 2) Development of Models for Prediction of Trial Outcomes: which model is the most suitable for prediction of outcomes in sequential trials and how to train a prediction model from highly-dimensional multi-therapy recipient sequential data; and 3) Guiding Therapy of a Child with Autism Based on an Early Classification Model: how to adjust and extend the previously developed approach by the project team to guide trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare. Recent legislative changes are driving all players within the healthcare ecosystem toward greater accountability. This Phase I project specifically includes technologies to automatically assess patient risk and thereby reduce post-discharge readmissions rates. This Phase I project has the potential to support a broad range of customers across both the provider and the payer landscape, by providing cost-effective readmissions control solutions that respond to new legislative pressures. In terms of commercial potential, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has estimated that preventable hospital readmissions account for $20 billion/year in wasteful healthcare spending. The addressable market for the proposed Phase I proof-of-concept for patient risk stratification to support readmission control is approximately $100MM. In the future, this research project will serve as a foundation to support broader population health analytics, the addressable market for which exceeds $500MM/year and is growing at a rate of 24% annually.

    The proposed project aims to develop a data mining system to capture and analyze information from electronic medical records in order to risk-stratify patients after they have been discharged from hospital. Leveraging interoperability standards that are required by federal regulation, the system will seamlessly aggregate data from multiple electronic medical record systems in a vendor-agnostic manner. A custom analytics engine will detect emergent patterns and draw inferences about each patient?s risk of readmission. If successful, this research will validate the end-to-end concept and suggest the broader applicability of this approach to some of the greatest challenges in population health.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project objective is to commercialize a novel technology for indexing video. The company's approach automatically integrates information from speech, text, and video through algorithms that generate rich semantic indexes for video. The Phase I results show that this approach can be incorporated into a system that indexes video with high accuracy and at a fraction of the cost of currently used methods. Further, during the Phase I research, the company has identified a large and growing consumer market (sports video) in which the technology can be applied.  The technical objectives of the Phase II proposal focus on working with such partners to roll out initial Bluefin-powered applications, such as content-based search and video-enriched fantasy sports. Such applications are currently not feasible because of the low accuracy of automated indexing methods and the high cost of manual approaches to indexing video.

    Millions of hours of new video content are coming online every month, feeding an exploding demand and reshaping the nature of the Internet. Just as text-oriented search engines were necessary to empower users to find what they needed during the first phase of the text-centric Internet, a new generation of technology will be necessary to organize and effectively find content in the fast-approaching video-dominated era of the Internet. Bluefin Lab is pioneering a new approach to video organization and search by commercializing cross-modal algorithms developed in Academe. While this differentiated technology can be leveraged in several target markets, the company's initial focus is on sports media where it will power a unique experience for video search, video-enhanced fantasy sports, and other video-centric applications.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
    new technology that will enable precise search of sports videos. Users will be
    able to search for specific players, teams, and plays from large archives of recorded
    video sports broadcasts. The proposed research will build on early results of
    a sports video search engine developed by the team at MIT. The approach combines
    semantic information mined from speech transcriptions with visual information
    extracted using video analysis algorithms. The proposed research will extend the
    existing software algorithms that have been developed for baseball video to other
    professional and college sports. Additional software tools will be developed to
    increase the accuracy of the search system, and new user interfaces based on natural
    language processing algorithms will be designed to enable simplified user access
    to video. The anticipated result of this research is a method for accurate video
    search and indexing that enables queries by natural language and requires significantly
    less human labor to initially tag video than existing techniques. \n\nThe broader
    impact of this research comes from the commercialization of this technology as
    a service layer which provides search and indexing solutions to multiple market
    segments that together represent a multibillion dollar industry in the United
    States. The research meets the needs of at least three market segments: (1) Sports
    professionals, who will gain powerful video access tools enabling better player
    evaluation, recruiting, coaching, and game analysis; (2) Sports news providers,
    who will be able to link news stories to related video clips thereby adding value
    to their media offerings; (3) Sports fans, who will be able to search and browse
    sports video archives with ease, providing new opportunities for advertising.
    Initial market research suggests that the access enabled by this technology would
    have broad impact on how sports video is used. Furthermore, the approach may later
    be extended to apply beyond sports to other video domains."

    at solving the computational problem of personalizing music search and recommendation.
    The recent explosion of digital music has created an urgent need for powerful
    knowledge management techniques and tools. Because of the highly subjective nature
    of musical content and perception, the best possible search strategy would rank
    media in a personalized fashion, based on each individual's tastes and preferences,
    from combined cultural and acoustic descriptions. The Echo Nest's predictive personalization
    technology computes and collects, collaboratively and automatically, cultural
    opinions online and acoustic content using unsupervised data mining and machine
    listening techniques. Combining cultural and acoustic notions of music together
    with the analysis of an individual's listening patterns, ratings and feedback,
    leads to a vertical search/recommendation engine that knows about content, communities'
    reaction, and users' preferences. \n\nIntelligent music personalization goes beyond
    search and recommendation. Because the approach is fully autonomous and scalable
    it can efficiently address the long tail of independent music as well as the Billboard
    100; discover artists and niches or predict trends and hits; market indies directly
    to individuals and optimize aggregators, distributors, and record labels' selection.
    The Echo Nest engine is the perceptual-media complement to purely text-based search
    engines and has a significant market potential."

    This SBIR Phase II project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to both natural language description and Internet link graphs to model communities in order to predict preference, taste and sentiment for different kinds of media (music, TV, online media, video games, books). Current contextual information mining approaches that scan the text on a page for advertisement or recommendation ignore valuable community connections inherent in most self-published Internet discussion. Sentiment and opinion extraction systems operating on full text create challenging language parsing problems are fraught with issues of scale and adaptability.  The identification systems can automatically categorize anonymous Internet writers or website visitors into specific demographic communities based on their tastes in many kinds of media. The Phase II research project approaches opinion extraction with a bias-free learning model based on training from known online corpuses that can be adapted to different languages and learns in real time as more data becomes available for high accuracy.

    Current personalization and marketing approaches either look at the "clickstream" of an anonymous user, leading to equally anonymous recommendations for popular movies and music -- or by scanning a surface-level overview of the text, leading to keyword advertisements with limited contextual understanding of entertainment content and community sentiment.  The project plans  to fully integrate people-focused community and sentiment analysis technologies into an autonomous, learning and scale-free "media knowledge service" for digital entertainment providers and marketers that can change the way digital content is marketed and sold.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a scale-up manufacturing process of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles. The main challenge is controlling the nanoparticle crystal size while maintaining high levels of nitric oxide storage.  In this project, critical process parameters including reactant addition rate, reaction temperature and mixing rate will be studied. The Balanced-Nucleation and Growth (BNG) Model will be utilized to transform process data into predictors of controlled particle size.

    The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide large-volume nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles for placement in products aimed at the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.  Availability of large-quantity nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles is important to combat the rising number of nosocomial infections.  However, the necessary scale-up technology to manufacture nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles is not available.  This project is expected to provide the processes to manufacture large quantities of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles for anti-infective product development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop an optimized ultra-short pulsed laser surgical device for high precision surgery in the sclera of the eye.  This tool may enable novel, office-based procedures to treat serious and common conditions, such as glaucoma and presbyopia.
    Phase I study results will be used to guide development of a new solid-state high power femtosecond laser source and scanning optical delivery system.  Performance will be evaluated in ex vivo human and animal tissue.  It is anticipated that this tool will be used to test long-lasting and minimally invasive glaucoma and presbyopia surgical procedures performed in the sclera.  These procedures will be developed through follow-up in vivo evaluations conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Michigan (to whom the device will be made available).  By providing a tool for non-invasive scleral channel formation, investigators will be able to address long-standing questions about why current glaucoma surgery fails, as well as how the loss of accommodation can be reversed.  These developments will raise the possibility of direct intervention for the two million Americans who have glaucoma and the millions more who suffer from presbyopia.
         The market for glaucoma is estimated at over $5 billion, while the potential market for presbyopia is probably several times greater. Since both glaucoma and presbyopia are associated with aging, their incidence is expected to rise.  The potential for low cost, office-based surgical procedures that are more effective than any current technique offers a compelling business model for the anticipated result of this proposal.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project examines high throughput methods to quantify intacellular microRNA (miRNA) concentrations in cells that have shown to be associated with normal physiological processes, as well as diseases, including cancer. Currently there are no rapid, quantitative methods available to measure miRNA expression in living cells or tumor tissue. All current in vitro approaches require extensive preparation involving extraction, reverse transcription of miRNA into cDNA and amplification. These methods are not only time consuming, but require that the low abundance miRNA be several fold greater than background to give a meaningful result. To meet the demand for a diagnostic/prognostic tool, development of a biomolecular detection device is proposed based on a single electron transistor to bind and measure the concentration of miRNAs. This will provide a researcher or clinician an accurate profile to make proper clinical assessments. Bringing this device to market will provide scientists with direct information on intracellular miRNA levels, enhancing predictions of miRNAs that are essential for tumor maintenance or metastasis, and creating new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.

    The broader impact of this project will be to enhance current diagnostic and prognostic tools for early detection of disease. Today, early cancer detection and treatment offers the best outcome for patients. This has driven the search for effective diagnostics. The identification of a universal tumor specific epitope or marker has remained elusive. While many types of serological and serum markers have included enzymes, proteins, hormones, mucin, and blood group substances, at this time there are no effective diagnostic tests for cancer that are highly specific, sensitive, economical and rapid. This deficiency means that many cases of malignancy go undetected long past the time of effective treatment. The goal of this research is to bring a device to market for the research market and a device that can examine miRNA profiles from patient samples immediately in a hospital or clinical setting. The current size of the in vitro diagnostic market was over $40 billion in 2008. Unique diagnostic kits developed from this technology will likely fulfill an unmet market opportunity with the potential to exceed $100 million in the first 3 - 5 years.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technologies that optimize the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals. RNAi is an invaluable tool for characterizing gene function and is a promising candidate for gene therapy. The use of RNAi in tissue culture is well developed but is of limited use in experimental animals. RNAi agents must enter cells to exert their effects but this has proven to be challenging in animals. The current lack of such technologies is holding back the majority of important RNAi animal experiments. To open this bottleneck, kits and reagents will be developed based on Bioo Scientific?s Targeted Transport Technology (T3). Easy-to-use RNAi delivery products will be manufactured, validated and commercialized for use in animal experiments.

    The broader impacts of this research are twofold. First, researchers will gain ready access to products that greatly simplify the use of RNAi in animals, thereby, stimulating a burst of validation experiments in animals to try to replicate prior results derived from tissue culture experiments. Animals are more complex than their tissue culture counterparts and it is uncertain that results can be duplicated in an animal. Second, T3 has the potential to be used for the therapeutic delivery of RNAi agents. In sum, this project will propel the validation of tissue culture results via T3 enabled animal experimentation, leading to a better understanding of cellular pathways, the identification of novel drug targets, and the potential to deliver RNAi agents as drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a technology to accurately measure small RNA expression.  This is an enabling life science research tool.  Small RNAs are ubiquitous gene regulators found in the body. Products of the same microRNA gene that vary in length by one or two nucleotides may be involved in a host of diseases, including cancer. The value for developing a method to measure the true profile of microRNAs in a sample would be immense for the research community studying transcriptional regulation, and would open the doors to those interested in drug development and diagnostics. The goal of this proposal is to develop a library preparation kit for non-biased small RNA libraries for Next Generation sequencing.  These kits will increase the quality and rate at which global microRNA profiles may be determined for research and clinical applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop next generation sequencing technology for small RNA more quantitative and less biased. High throughput sequencing has transformed the landscape of genomic research with its ability to produce gigabases of data in a single run. This has enabled researchers to perform genome wide and high depth sequencing studies that would normally not be possible. Despite this capacity, amplification artifacts introduced during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays increase the chance of duplicate reads and uneven distribution of read coverage. Accurate profiling using deep sequencing also has been undermined by biases with over- or under-represented microRNAs. The presence of these biases significantly limits the incredible sensitivity and accuracy made possible by next generation sequencing. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel bias-reducing technology for making small RNA libraries. The proposed kits and protocols will increase the rate at which global microRNA profiles can be determined, and between-sample and within-sample differences (as well as newly discovered small RNAs) can be subsequently validated. This product will result in a major shift in the way small RNA sequencing is performed, and will pave the way for the discovery of new small RNAs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to address the steadily growing but unsustainable polymer matrix composite (PMC) market. PMCs are leveraged for their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios as compared to conventional engineering materials, but are notoriously unsustainable, energy-intensive to manufacture, and non-recyclable.  Researchers have investigated encapsulating natural fibers with both petroleum-based polymers and biopolymers (e.g. cellulosic plastic) to produce more biocompatible composites with varying degrees of experimental and commercial success, but all attempts have still fallen short of an ideal "bio-composite". In this project, we will create and characterize an entirely new bio-composite material. The basic idea is to use mycelium as a matrix for binding natural fibers and core filler materials together in sustainable composite parts.  First, the core bulk material is bound together over time by mycelium growing into and around common bulk agricultural waste such as cotton hulls.  Then, reinforcing layers made from natural fibers (e.g., hemp) inoculated with fungal cells are applied to the core faces, allowed to infiltrate the laminate and bind to the core material, and then heated to inactivate the growth process to make a resilient composite sandwich structure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project encompasses the development of mycelium composite materials that are customizable for a broad range of markets including, but not limited to, automotive, transportation, architectural, biomedical, sports, and recreation. These materials are truly sustainable since both the laminates and cores consist of renewable materials.  These composites will also require significantly less energy to make than other biocompatible composites because the material is grown instead of synthesized, and the material is completely compostable at the end of life. The outcome of the proposed research and development will be a basic understanding of how to manufacture the composites, the range of material properties obtainable, and how to adjust material properties for particular markets. Through this project, we will partner with researchers and students at two local universities with known expertise in composites manufacturing and testing. If successful with mycelium composites, these materials will find applications in a very high-margin market (i.e. composites) that is sorely needing more sustainable innovations.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Using Mycelium As A Matrix For Binding Natural Fibers And
    Core Filler Materials In Sustainable Composites'
- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to
    further reduce the economic and environmental costs associated with sterilization
    of precursor materials for the Mycobond platform.  Mycobond is a revolutionary
    material that is grown from agricultural byproducts and a vegetative growth of
    a filamentous fungus (basidiomycete mycelium).  To ensure adequate growth all
    raw materials are either sterilized or pasteurized, which represents up to 24
    hours of process time and 50% of the material cost. This research intends to use
    an emulsion comprised of phenolic compounds from plant essential oils (PEOs) to
    inactivate competitive organisms on all feedstocks while reducing manufacturing
    costs. Preliminary trails have yielded favorable results, indicating a potential
    reduction of the disinfection costs by 88%.  Furthermore, this procedure can significantly
    reduce both the capital expense associated with production and the environmental
    footprint by removing high entropy processes.  Achieving successful disinfection
    with PEOs, and later inoculation with the desired mycelium, will allow the Mycobond?
    technology to retail at prices below those of expanded polystyrene (EPS), granting
    a competitive advantage that would aid in gaining rapid market adoption.  The
    technology benchmarks well against EPS, and has interested early adopters in the
    protective packaging and rigid board insulation industries. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is the development of sustainable, high-performance
    composite materials for the packaging and insulation industries.  10% of the petroleum
    imported into the United States is allocated to the production of inherently unsustainable
    materials. The Mycobond platform is a direct replacement for many these materials,
    applicable for products from protective packaging to structural cores. The use
    of a PEO emulsion seeks to further reduce the energy consumption of material production
    by closely emulating nature. The biological composites and related processes can
    reduce energy consumption fivefold and greenhouse gas emissions by tenfold when
    compared to an identical volume of EPS.  Furthermore, since the raw materials
    used are byproducts from American industries, a new revenue stream will result,
    bolstering local economies. The plants and related compounds utilized in the procedure
    are rapidly renewable and the proposed disinfection platform is an open system
    which reduces dependence on a solitary feedstock. The use of PEO emulsions to
    disinfect materials has value beyond composites production, and will find applications
    in agriculture industry and commercial cultivation of mushrooms.  The effective
    replacement of high-embodied energy processes will support local manufacturing
    by increasing the feasibility of low-cost, regional production."

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative, environmentally benign process for forming net shape products of superior quality and performance from dissimilar biomaterial components.  Plastics and foams are dependent upon inherently unsustainable raw materials, require a high embodied energy to produce, and do not readily biodegrade at the end of their useful lives.  This project will focus on the further development of an alternative material system: a self-assembling biocomposite which is literally grown in the dark using fungal tissue to bind heterogeneous particles of agricultural waste.  The biodegradable material exhibits mechanical properties that rival synthetic foams and offers the potential to transform the multi-billion dollar protective packaging and structural cores industries. However, the thin-walled plastic forms used to shape resulting products during growth have a limited service life and must be replaced frequently.  Removing or reducing dependence on these forms, through development of a gelatinizing growth substrate and process, will increase sustainability and yield, and reduce costs to further incentivize widespread adoption.  The proposed research will answer questions that will determine whether this gel-assisted casting process is technically and commercially feasible, and therefore laying the groundwork for a Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is difficult to overstate.  Conventional methods of producing low-cost, high strength-to-weight ratio materials for protective packaging and building construction use up to 10% of the world's petroleum as feedstock and consume considerable energy in the production process. Mycological material technology eliminates the need for fossil fuel feedstock and currently requires only one-eighth of the energy to produce an equivalent volume as compared to synthetic foam. In addition, the products are non-toxic, fire-retardant, and readily biodegradable. The commercial potential is high, as products made of this material, as currently manufactured, already successfully compete in the marketplace with products made of expanded polystyrene and expanded polypropylene. The benefits to society at large include safer materials, the transition to regional manufacturing which will bolster local economies, the use of domestic byproducts as the primary raw material, lower energy consumption, and a production method which creates less waste and pollution. The successful completion of this project will help United States manufacturers to emerge as world leaders in the production and supply of sustainable materials, with the potential to serve numerous global markets.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further quantify the mechanical performance of mycological bio-composites that address the automotive and structural core industries, while concurrently scaling and demonstrating material production.  The engineered composites market continues to grow steadily because of the high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios of these systems, as compared to conventional engineering materials. Engineered woods are ubiquitous in the construction and furniture industries, but due to domestic indoor air quality regulations (Toxic Substances Control Act), these materials are being phased out or are forced to use expensive formaldehyde-free adhesives.  Similarly, the automotive industry is under regulatory pressure in Europe to find alternatives to fire-retardant foams that cannot be recycled due to inorganic filling agents.  The technical results from the Phase I effort have demonstrated bio-composite materials which can compete both economically, and on mechanical performance, with the aforementioned competitors, while meeting these legislative demands.  A preliminary cost analysis based on the process economics of our existing production facilities projects retail costs 45% and 35% below the current state-of-the-art in the automotive and furniture industries, respectively.  We will work with key industry partners to meet performance metrics and demonstrate quality pilot production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a customizable bio-composite for a broad range of markets, including automotive, transportation, architectural, furniture, sports, and recreation. These materials are truly sustainable, since both the laminates and cores used in the sandwich structure consist of renewable materials.  They also require significantly less energy to make than other biocompatible composites, because the material is grown instead of synthesized, and the material is completely compostable at the end of life. The outcome of the proposed development and demonstration will ensure that the bio-composite properties meet the requirements for the target markets.  Furthermore, over the course of this grant, and in cooperation with Rensselaer and Union College, we will demonstrate and scale the best manufacturing processes to a pilot stage capable of manufacturing high volumes of quality product.  Since these materials leverage regional lignocellulosic byproducts from domestic agriculture and industry, a regional manufacturing model is presently being pursued to reduce transportation and feedstock costs. This will not only bring additional value to U.S. agricultural markets, but will spur rural economic development through domestic manufacturing. Finally, these advanced biological materials represent a new paradigm in manufacturing, offering safe, biodegradable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based alternatives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop, and demonstrate at scale, a biological disinfection process that has exhibited superior microbial inactivation to steam pasteurization at a lower cost. This process leverages dilute concentrations (0.5-0.875% by volume) of plant-derived phenols and aldehydes to inactivate lower level fungi and bacteria found on agricultural byproducts (seed husks and hulls). The application focus for this demonstration is a novel material technology that converts lignocellulosic waste into a high performance, low cost replacement for synthetics (plastics and foams) using a filamentous fungus. This biological disinfection process can reduce process energy consumption by 83% and system capital expense by upwards of 50%. This project will fully quantify the efficacy of this disinfection process at scale (production volumes) as well as analyze the integration of this technique into a mycological material production facility that is presently addressing the protective packaging industry. Batch and continuous systems will be explored, and a comprehensive economic model will be developed based on the results. The mycological materials that are produced under this demonstration will be compared with materials fabricated with the existing pasteurization system, and samples will be evaluated by customers to ensure product adoption.

    High-embodied energy disinfection processes, autoclave sterilization or pasteurization, are ubiquitous within industries such as agriculture, food processing, and biotechnology. These methodologies are implemented to reduce or remove background bioburden (bacteria, yeast, mold) that can be detrimental to downstream processes due to contamination. Mycological materials production represents such a process since raw material contamination results in product loss and added labor. The plant essential oil (PEO) disinfection technique was proven under the Phase I research to offer a comparable process time to steam pasteurization and superior disinfection efficacy; thus this technology could serve as a drop-in replacement in some industrial applications. This process minimizes capital equipment and operations costs due a reduction in system complexity and energy consumption. In regards to the production of mycological products, this disinfection process bolsters the process robustness by extending contaminate inactivation periods which promotes rapid mycelium colonization or a reduction in incubation time. Therefore new market opportunities for mycological materials can be addressed while further supporting the business case for regional manufacturing using domestic agricultural waste as raw materials. Finally, the benefits obtained from this novel disinfection process permit an accelerated deployment and development of turnkey production systems to displace synthetic materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project is designed to commercialize a consumer self-serve, automated kiosk for the evaluation, buy back, and collection of used electronics directly from consumers.  Prototype kiosks deployed during Phase I provided convincing proof of the feasibility of the baseline technical approach to the visual and electrical inspection technology, robotics, and the market.  Financial metrics achieved were many multiples better than industry leading kiosks such as Coinstar or Redbox.  Further R&D is required to achieve enough reliability in the automated inspection systems and the kiosk hardware to lead to the permanent removal the kiosk attendants in field that currently serve as the fail-safe mechanism in the current prototype systems.  Broad commercial success relies on the development of a robust, designed-for-manufacturability (DFM), designed-for-serviceability (DFS), commercially reliable kiosk with a minimum retail field life of 5 years that incorporates needed improvements learned from Phase I including refinements to the visual inspection system and algorithms, electrical inspection system, test station robotics subsystems, ergonomics, GUI, and channel management systems.  ecoATM also hopes to further develop the system?s capability to offer personal data erasure and expand accepted device types to potentially include digital cameras, portable game players, printer cartridges, laptops, eReaders, and tablets.

    The broader impact of ecoATM?s patented system is that we finally achieved the threshold of consumer convenience and financial incentive required to inspire mass consumer participation in electronics recycling.  Our pilot market tests indicate that we harvested 20 times more used phones than the next closest competitor in the test areas.   As ecoATM scales nationally we will divert mass amounts of toxic eWaste from our landfills, and put huge sums of cash back in the hands of our customers and the retail locations hosting the kiosks, providing stimulus and incentive for these stakeholders to help forever alter the current wasteful lifecycle of consumer electronics.  On average, each ecoATM collects enough eWaste to offset its own annual energy consumption after just 5 days placement resulting in 360 days of CO2 offset.  An average ecoATM collects over 7,000 phones per year, which according to the EPA calculator is equivalent to taking the CO2 of 35 houses off the grid for a year.  National and global media have taken notice of ecoATM already and even the United Nation?s Low Carbon Leadership Program recognized ecoATM as one of the best ideas in the world for the reduction of CO2 on a global basis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the significant technical barriers associated with an untethered overground cooperative gait rehabilitation exoskeleton. Current gait rehabilitation techniques available to patients with gait abnormalities include conventional therapist based rehabilitation and more recently Body Weight Support Treadmill (BWST) robotic rehabilitation. The leading BWST devices employ a cooperative gait rehabilitation approach that varies the assistance to the user based on their ability. The conventional therapy approach is extremely labor intensive, but while the BWST therapy is the leading alternative it has shown mixed results. Researchers hypothesize that this is due to differences in the trained gait between BWST walking and overground walking. Mobile exoskeletons have emerged to better imitate overground walking, but to date no mobile device has implemented a cooperative control strategy, mainly due to the technical issues associated with its use. This SBIR intends to develop novel advances in cooperative rehabilitation control strategies along with innovative actuator designs to make possible the first mobile overground gait rehabilitation exoskeleton that implements a cooperative strategy. Specifically, it will address the major technical barriers to achieving this goal to increase the chances of successfully developing this technology in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project could directly impact the lives of patients with impaired gaits from a variety of symptoms including post-stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. It is estimated that nearly 2 million patients in the U.S. could currently benefit from improved gait rehabilitation therapy. This technology can be sold directly to rehabilitation hospitals through existing distribution channels. This technology will have a significant impact on the lives of patients undergoing gait rehabilitation. It will enable a new level of effectiveness by providing a novel cooperative rehabilitation approach on an overground device. Existing conventional therapy often causes patients to transition to therapist-assisted overground walking prematurely, resulting in a gap in the progression of care. This device addresses that gap by supporting a patient from acute therapy until they are strong enough for therapist-assisted overground walking. Finally, this device will expand our technical understanding of the limits and effectiveness of robotic gait rehabilitation. The device will serve as a platform to develop the next generation of even more effective robotic rehabilitation control strategies, both for the investigators and the greater research community.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes to create an in-home gait training device that allows a post-stroke patient to undergo rehabilitation with little or no assistance. Approximately 500,000 Americans survive a stroke each year. Miraculously, most stroke survivors can relearn skills, such as walking, that are lost when part of the brain is damaged. They can relearn walking most effectively if they are aided in making the correct motions by a machine or a physical therapist while attempting to walk. This training is expensive and requires the patient to make regular visits to a stroke center or qualified physical therapy center. Berkeley Bionics proposes to create a lightweight robotic exoskeleton which cradles a patient?s lower extremities and torso, and maneuvers their rehabilitating limbs for them.

    The broader impacts of this research are immense. These devices could move most post-stroke rehabilitation out of the clinical setting thereby reducing labor costs dramatically. The gait training exoskeletons will be wearable, very unobtrusive, and allow patients to maneuver in the real world. Patients would therefore be able to wear such devices for most of the day, thus remaining mobile and gaining the therapeutic effects of physical therapy over the course of a day, rather than just a short session. Furthermore, creating such a device will also give clinicians an alternative to the wheelchair to assist patients who are unable to recover adequate mobility to function in their daily lives. This could potentially reduce unhealthy effects of wheelchair use for millions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes will study the technology barriers associated with creating exoskeleton assist devices for workers in distribution centers and automobile assembly plants. By using these devices, workers can dramatically reduce the load in the
    vertebrae of the lower back when maneuvering parts and boxes. The assist device will take the majority of the load off of the user?s body. Such collaboration between humans and machines has the benefit of the intellectual advantage of humans coupled with the strength advantage of machines. The proposed project involves the University of California at Berkeley as research partner, General Motors Corporation, and the U.S. Postal Service. The end goal is a reduction in back injuries in the workplace which are considered by OSHA the nation?s number one workplace safety problem.

    The broader impacts of this research are reduced worker?s compensation insurance costs, reduced disability payments, increased worker productivity, and the ability for workers to keep working into their older years. Furthermore, these new devices will open an entirely new market which will serve an important role in establishing the United States as the number one player in the emerging field of bionics. Additionally, establishing this market for exoskeletons will enable the development of other exoskeleton markets which include military exoskeletons for carrying backpack and body armor loads, rescue worker exoskeletons, stair climbing exoskeletons for urban firefighters, and wild-land firefighter exoskeletons. The potential impacts to worker safety and American quality of life are large and diverse.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes the development of an integrated powered knee-ankle prosthesis. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of integrated powered knee and ankle joints in trans-femoral prostheses that use sensory information from the ground and the wearer. The hypothesis is that a prosthesis with actively powered knee and ankle joints will significantly enhance the mobility of trans-femoral amputees while walking on level grounds, as well as stairs and slopes. The inability to deliver power to prosthetic systems has significantly impaired their ability to restore many locomotive functions. This proposal will derive a set of guidelines on design and control of an integrated powered knee and ankle prosthetic system which will improve locomotion function such as walking up stairs, walking up slopes, running, jumping, and as hypothesized in this proposal, even level walking. The proposed work will result in new theoretical frameworks for control and sensory systems, and the design of such systems. Major intellectual contributions will include the design of power systems; development of the sensory system to obtain information from the ground and from the user; the development of a control framework for the interactive control of prostheses; and the development of adaptive and robust controllers for impedance modulation during locomotion.

    This project intends to create principles that provide significantly greater functional capabilities for above-knee amputees. Specifically, our work will enable more natural, stable, and adaptable prostheses. These research elements in this proposal will also form a foundation for powered orthotic systems. Additional significant benefits of this work include fostering a broader awareness and increased sensitivity of young engineers and educational institutions to disability issues. Limb loss is also afflicting a growing number of military personnel serving in recent conflicts, as well as a far larger number of veterans from previous wars. The recent Middle East conflicts have resulted in a number of young amputees, many of whom still shoulder the responsibility of raising families and anticipate a working life ahead of them. The integrated knee-ankle prosthetic proposed here will have a direct impact on the mobility of the trans-femoral amputees and their quality of life, and most likely alleviate the long-term consequences related to musculoskeletal health.

    The broader impacts of this research are reduced worker?s compensation insurance costs, reduced disability payments, increased worker productivity, and the ability for workers to keep working into their older years; in short, improve worker quality of life. Furthermore, these new devices will open an entirely new market which will serve an important role in establishing the United States as the number one player in the emerging field of bionics. The potential impacts to worker safety and American quality of life are large and diverse.

    Risk of Back Injuries among Workers'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project proposes the development of the design features, sensory system and the control algorithm of an integrated powered knee-ankle power regenerative prosthesis. Despite significant advances in lower limb prosthetics over the past decade, all presently commercially available lower limb prostheses incorporate passive ankle joints. That is, the joints of the prostheses can either store or dissipate energy, but cannot provide any net power over a gait cycle. The inability to deliver joint power significantly impairs the ability of these prostheses to restore many locomotive functions, including level walking, walking up stairs, walking up slopes, running, and jumping, all of which require significant net positive power at the knee joint, ankle joint, or both. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of integrated powered knee and ankle joints in transfemoral prostheses that use sensory information from the ground and the wearer. The hypothesis is that a prosthesis with actively powered knee and ankle joints will significantly enhance the mobility of transfemoral amputees while walking on level grounds, as well as stairs and slopes.

    The proposed work will result in new theoretical frameworks for both the control, sensory system, and design of such systems. Major intellectual contributions will include the design of power systems; development of the sensory system to obtain information from the ground and from the user; the development of a control framework for the interactive control of prostheses; and the development of adaptive and robust controllers for impedance modulation during locomotion. This project intends to create principles that provide significantly greater functional capabilities for above-knee amputees. Specifically, the proposed work will enable more natural, stable, and adaptable prostheses. These research elements in this proposal will also form a foundation for powered orthotic systems. Additional significant benefits of this work include fostering a broader awareness and increased sensitivity of young engineers and educational institutions to disability issues. Limb loss also affects a growing number of military personnel serving in recent conflicts, as well as a far larger number of veterans from previous wars.
