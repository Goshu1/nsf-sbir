    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate the feasibility of enhancing the core individual user application and commercial backend portal products as required to enhance and measure the efficacy of innovative addiction treatment and recovery support tools. If successful, the investment will enable healthcare stakeholders (e.g., individuals, addiction and mental health institutions and providers, health researchers and universities, government agencies, and payers) to leverage technology-enhanced addiction treatment innovations such as mindfulness training, contingency management, medication-assisted treatment, peer support, and adaptive interventions that show promise for improving health outcomes and delivery efficiencies. The proposed innovation will help to determine the feasibility of developing, testing, and commercializing innovative technologies that improve the efficacy of existing health IT solutions and to create new solutions for the range of stakeholders exhibiting increasingly high demand for effective interventions and tools required to develop, provide, and assess effective addiction treatment and recovery support services in a mix of research and delivery settings and the ability to generate significant revenue across the mix of public and private addiction recovery delivery settings.

    The proposed project will entail rapidly assembling the technical foundation and then testing the feasibility of supporting deployment and assessment of novel, evidence-based addiction treatment strategies and recovery interventions. There are four key research objectives: (1) design, develop, and test a mechanism to create statistically significant cohorts; (2) discern and test methods to measure participant recovery and sobriety success; (3) conduct internal treatment campaigns; and, (4) create a researcher application program interface to enable addiction researchers to connect with the system. Currently, there is no commercially viable platform for surfacing, implementing, and tracking the efficacy of optimal therapies and tools in an application environment. Phase I will focus on determining the feasibility of this technology for unlocking scientific interventions that can be clinically validated as successful in order to expand work in phase II to prove the capacity of this system to deliver single or bivariate therapy campaigns to users while also establishing the clinical efficacy for improving health outcomes sufficient to support interventions nationwide through cost-effective treatment solutions.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is a significant advance in the production of hydrogen
    peroxide. The project, if successful, will yield an on-site electrolytic generation
    method that reduces the cost of peroxide production by up to 50% compared to the
    traditional centralized chemical process. By reducing cost, hydrogen peroxide
    can be used more widely as an oxidizer in bleaching, wastewater treatment, and
    other processes, ultimately lowering chlorine pollution by replacing chlorine-based
    oxidizers. The paper/pulp and textiles industry in particular will benefit from
    lower cost bleaching chemicals and reduced effluent treatment costs. The electrolytic
    method reduces environmental pollution and eliminates the need for transportation
    of explosive high concentration hydrogen peroxide. The innovative electrolyzer
    design used for hydrogen peroxide production will enhance the scientific knowledge
    base on how to build improved electrode structures that support multiphase flow,
    and may have applications in other industrial electrolysis systems, including
    the chlor-alkali process.\n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate
    a scaled-up high efficiency alkaline hydrogen peroxide electrolyzer system. The
    most difficult challenge to overcome for scale-up relates to the electrode manufacturing
    process. The electrodes are made by coating a catalyst-containing ink onto a conductive
    substrate. The composition of the ink is non-standard, and has not been coated
    at commercial scale. The Phase I research will involve detailed investigations
    of ink formulation, coating, and processing conditions for roll-to-roll manufacturing
    of the oxygen reduction electrode. The roll-to-roll manufactured electrodes will
    be tested in pilot-scale hardware to demonstrate their durability and performance.
    Manufacturing-friendly multilayer coatings will be developed and investigated
    to overcome challenges associated with multiphase flow. After completing pilot-scale
    electrode manufacturing, the electrolyzer stack will be assembled and tested at
    an experimental bleaching facility to ensure that the electrolytically-generated
    alkaline peroxide can be used as a bleaching chemical. The development of the
    multiphase electrode in this Phase I project will enable improvements in other
    electrolytic processes using multiphase flows."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the commercial viability of a new substrate material specifically designed for reducing the manufacturing complexity of stretchable electronics. Currently a $1.6 million market, stretchable electronics are expected to grow at a cumulative annual growth rate of 101.3% to reach $412 million in sales by 2023 due to the surge in wearable technologies, structural health monitoring devices, and medical diagnostic tools. In part, the current market size for stretchable electronics is limited by the immature manufacturing tools and techniques required, such as transfer- and nano-printing. The research and development funded by the Phase I SBIR could lead to a drastic reduction in manufacturing complexity, allowing stretchable electronic devices to be manufactured using current industry standard photolithographic techniques.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the ability to create electronic substrate materials with intrinsic stiffness differences (those without laminated layers, patterned fillers, etc.) that are defined using standard lithography techniques. Specifically, these substrates can be spatially segregated into regions of low Young's modulus (the soft matrix) and regions of high Young's modulus (the stiff islands) with a difference in modulus between these two regions reaching ratios of 1000:1 (stiff:soft). In the initial work, demonstrations of these spatially-heterogeneous modulus substrates show that spatial resolution can be achieved at the millimeter scale, and can introduce localized strain across the substrate as a function of the patterned stiff regions. The objectives for this project are focused on (a) engineering an optimal starting substrate material with the desired properties for the soft region and (b) demonstrating microfabrication of micropatterned thin-film components (feature sizes < 20 microns) of  stiff regions introduced into the material. This Phase I grant will culminate in prototype thin-film electronic components which maintain electrical performance at high global strains, while also showing the capacity of the substrate materials to withstand the harsh thermal and chemical conditions observed during microfabrication.

    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture
    allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly
    to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced
    image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning
    accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal
    growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts
    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to them. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two key research objectives: scaling the technology to work for teams of size 10,000+, and determining the feasibility of porting the technology to mobile. A major scalability research area is search. The company envisions the technology to be the primary place where decisions are made, and hence a primary place where knowledge is stored, so fast, full-text search is important, despite the fact that chat generates much more traffic than email. One research area on mobile is the HCI challenge of displaying rich options for conversation navigation on a small mobile screen. The problem is unique to this technology, since having long running, asynchronous conversations means that users do not typically read messages in a strictly chronological fashion. The company anticipates the Phase I grant will enable it to develop a working solution to the search scalability problem, and a working prototype of a performant and productive mobile user experience.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.

    The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.

    This SBIR Phase I project tackles the key challenges of using screen-printing to manufacture receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at a commercial scale. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long exam times and a high rate of failure, resulting in high costs. Printed receive coils are flexible, lightweight, conform well to the human body and can be manufactured at an order of magnitude lower costs. With this technology, coils can be designed and printed to fit all patient anatomy, therefore improving image quality and offering superior comfort. These technology offers the potential to increase success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time and to enhance clinical workflow. Printed coils will have an impact on the accessibility to MRI, serving a more diverse patient population, such as pediatric and bariatric patients, who currently have limited access to this imaging modality, due to the lack of adequate coils. Overall, this project aims at enabling the fabrication of printed coils, thus contributing to reduce health care costs associated with MRI while significantly improving the quality of patient care.


    This SBIR Phase I project investigates critical aspects of characterization of screen-printing MRI coil arrays for clinical use. We have shown that printed and flexible MRI arrays provide diagnostic images, while providing better fit and comfort to patients.  Printing electronic materials is a novel manufacturing approach which is used here to fabricate these medical devices.  Our goal is to provide coils with size and design customized for the diverse anatomy of patients. In this proposed program, we will evaluate the reproducibility of printing, design strategies and the robustness and lifetime of printed coil arrays. Coil size and geometry have a direct impact on image quality and body coverage. We will study the fundamental limits of coil size and geometry when fabricated using solution processed conductors with lower conductivity than conventional metals. The variations in measured signal-to-noise-ratio and image quality from print to print will be characterized and documented in order to provide a successful model for large-scale and low-cost manufacturing of coil arrays. Finally, the robustness of printed arrays will be tested. The packaging used in our designs are significantly different from the status-quo. Lifetime quantification for arrays used in clinical scenarios is important for a successful business plan.

    spaces. While it is impossible to put a monetary value on tragedies averted and
    lives saved, improved public safety will reduce the effects of the fear these
    actions create on society and on economic growth. Market growth in people screening
    and security, as well as navigational assistance, is already proven (40+% annual
    growth rate) but is constrained by the size, cost, and slow speed of existing
    solutions. The portability, cost, and video-rate capability of this camera will
    expand the markets as well as enable new markets not yet served. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a demonstration of a novel

    in millimeter wave is cost-prohibitive since each pixel costs hundreds of dollars.
    This device enables the application of proven optical single-pixel technologies
    to millimeter wave imaging, thereby greatly decreasing the cost and increasing

    test a series of designs that vary around the optimum design defined by the modeling,
    to refine the modeling, and then to repeat the fabrication, in a tighter range
    of geometries, around the new optimum. The result of this SBIR Phase I project

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to remove organic pollutants using newly developed adsorbent materials derived from cyclodextrins. The chemical contamination of water resources due to agricultural, industrial, and human activities is known to have adverse effects on the environment, especially aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Currently utilized adsorbents, particularly activated carbons, typically have limitations in removing micropollutants effectively at environmentally relevant concentrations, ranging from parts per trillion (ppt) to parts per billion (ppb). This project will focus on the fundamental development and manufacture of polymer adsorbents from building blocks derived from corn starch that rapidly sequester many pollutants more effectively than activated carbons. These polymers exhibit tiny pores and high surface areas, and are structurally programmable to target specific contaminants and separation challenges. Current water filtration systems found in homes, hospitals, industrial settings, and municipal wastewater treatment sites will benefit from these activities.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a sustainable materials solution to address the problem of emerging organic contaminants in water. Promising materials are derived from a cyclodextrin monomer and a crosslinker, which react to provide a rigid porous network. Materials derived from this approach remove contaminants from water more effectively than leading adsorbents, such as activated carbons. Previously, initial polymers were prepared at laboratory scales in relatively low yields. The objective of this proposal is to develop polymerization conditions that provide high yields and are amenable to large-scale manufacturing processes, while maintaining the pollutant removal performance of the polymer. This objective will require a systematic study of reaction conditions to minimize side reactions and maximize polymerization efficiency. Structural characterization using various spectroscopies and porosimetry will be used to evaluate the polymerization process as a function of the reaction conditions. The polymer's ability to bind pollutants will also ensure that improved yields still maintain performance. Determining the optimal polymerization conditions and processing protocols will be critical for validating the technical feasibility of the proposed porous cyclodextrin polymer and will also be criteria for the success of this SBIR Phase I project.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a high throughput, imagery-based single cell analysis system.  The system will be used to characterize high cell density polymicrobial samples captured during biological research.  Initially, the technology will be applied to the problem of quantifying extremely low levels of microbial contamination in biological samples.  The quantification and control of microbial contamination is an important challenge in industrial fermentation and in the manufacturing of biologics.  Methods for rapid and sensitive detection of microbial contaminants do not exist.  Traditional contamination detection methods involve time-consuming culturing of cells or manual and imprecise checks with a microscope.  The proposed technology will provide automated and rapid sample characterization, allowing a speed of analysis that is 1000 times faster than current systems.  This increased throughput will additionally allow lower levels of contamination to be quantified.  While initially applied to research, the technology can also be used as an analytical and diagnostic tool in the medical field.  For example, this analysis system could be used to search for malformed red blood cells in a human sample that might arise due to a disease like sickle cell anemia, or to determine the relative abundance and morphology of immune cells, an analysis that would help identify certain leukemias.

    This project will create a hardware platform and a parallelized computer vision system that is capable of fully characterizing each cell in a 1mL biological sample in under five minutes.  To analyze samples taken from a fermentation process with high cell densities requires the micrography system to be capable of processing over one billion cells in the analysis window.  The project aims to develop four subsystems: a high pressure microfluidic system for separating and isolating cells, an imaging system, a set of high throughput algorithms to classify the cellular imagery data and a horizontally-scalable computing platform on which to run the classifying code.  The project will begin by developing a low throughput, fully functioning prototype.  The efforts will then focus on developing the four primary subsystems in parallel, using knowledge gained in the prototyping efforts to guide the later work.  Additional phases will focus on the integration of high throughput versions of the subsystems.  The fully realized single cell micrography system will represent a leap forward in speed and specificity compared to traditional cytometry systems.  With no manual intervention and in an open-ended, label-free manner, researchers will be able to conduct parts per billion-level inspection of a biological sample.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-I project employs the
    development of intelligent and sustainable coating technology to present a game
    changing option to the corrosion protection coating industry. The annual global
    cost of corrosion is estimated to be US$2.5 trillion while USA alone has to lose
    more than $1 trillion. The global anticorrosion coating market has been valued
    for more than US$14 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach beyond US$26 billion
    in 2022. Apart from inferior performance, currently available corrosion prevention
    coatings pose significant threat to the environment and human health. It is very
    hard for the poor and developing countries to bear the related costs. Development
    of this multifunctional coating will afford them a safer alternative for protecting
    their assets. In preliminary experiments, this coating innovation has shown significant
    potential in preventing corrosion and biofouling activity on the treated surface.
    The thermal analysis and nanomechanical analysis have indicated that these coatings
    have exceptionally high thermal and mechanical stability approaching that of ceramic
    materials. Based on the preliminary data, it is safe to state that these coatings
    present a breakthrough in the area of surface protection through barrier coatings.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes the development of user friendly
    multifunctional coating for wide variety of substrates. Historically, chromate
    conversion coatings (CCC) have been extensively used in preventing metals from
    corroding. However, there are serious concerns over the use of CCC as it poses
    human health risks. Carcinogenic hexavalent chromium ions used in coating technology
    for the corrosion protection of metals are being phased out by Environmental Protection
    Agency in USA and Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals
    regulation in Europe. The key innovation of this project is the development of
    a liquid precursor to a transparent strong ceramic-like coating that can protect
    substrates from harsh environmental conditions. This ready to use thin coating,
    suitable for application in the automobile and aerospace industries, adheres strongly
    to most substrates, adds minimal weight and can be transparent or pigmented. Besides
    corrosion protection, the coating can also provide scratch resistance, oleophobicity,
    and possibly anti-microbial properties to numerous surfaces."

    This SBIR Phase I project will focus on a novel medical ultrasound device for the accurate diagnosis of middle ear infections. The device uses a small transducer that transmits ultrasound energy into the ear canal to determine whether a middle ear infection is present, and whether an antibiotic is appropriate. The focus will be to design and optimize an air-coupled MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) ultrasound transducer. The device will be a cost-effective method to improve diagnoses and reduce antibiotics in a market in which 17.6M doctor visits per year are coded directly to middle ear infections in the U.S. Ear infections are the #1 indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children and the #1 cause for surgery in childhood, costing more than $10B annually in the U.S. Accessing this market will require consistent device performance with low variability and rare failure, as well as the ability to perform manufacturing with a high yield.

    This SBIR Phase I project will seek to enable the development of the first known commercial medical product utilizing air-coupled (capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer) CMUT technology. CMUTs have been proposed for many applications, but very few have moved beyond the early research stage due to the high degree of technical difficulty and cost required to translate a research device into one that generates consistent transducer performance with low variability and rare failure rate. The work of this proposal facilitates the investigators? goal by establishing fast automated assessment of CMUT performance, both electrically and mechanically. The investigators will design and construct test systems to rapidly and automatically evaluate electromechanical and acoustical performance of CMUT designs. The electromechanical system automatically evaluates electrical impedance across frequency and bias voltage. The acoustical test system automatically evaluates pulse-echo directivity and sensitivity of a given CMUT, across bias voltage and pulsing parameters. The authors propose to use the two test systems to determine electromechanical tests which can be done in the foundry at the wafer level, which are predictive of acoustic performance. NSF funding is being sought to make this challenging but promising CMUT technology a commercial reality.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the opportunity to provide accurate, real
    time information to motivate patients to manage their disease; drive early, evidenced-based
    interventions; and prevent unnecessary physician visits and hospital stays.  This
    non-invasive device, a breathalyzer, will measure the level of ammonia in exhaled
    breath.  High ammonia levels are associated with conditions such as advanced liver
    disease, urea cycle disorders (UCD), or adverse reactions to medication.  It has
    serious consequences: disorientation, organ/brain damage, coma and even death,
    making it important to take steps to quickly reduce systemic ammonia and, if the
    cause is unknown, trigger further diagnostic activities.  Currently, ammonia levels
    are determined through blood testing, which is invasive, takes time, requires
    a lab/hospital visit, and is prone to errors.  There are no tools available to
    accurately measure ammonia, real time.  The device will enable patients and families
    to take control and make better decisions: what to eat, when not to drive, when
    to go to the hospital, among other things.  This can improve productivity, enhance
    quality of life for patients and their families, avoid unnecessary healthcare
    expenditures, and save lives.   \n\nThe proposed project seeks to develop a breathalyzer
    prototype to detect ammonia in exhaled breath.  The device is expected to provide
    clinically-accurate, real time information to patients and clinicians.  Ammonia
    occurs naturally as a by-product of protein metabolism but, at elevated levels,
    it is indicative of disease and can have very serious consequences.  Contemporary
    research has identified roughly 250 common volatile organic compounds in exhaled
    breath, many associated with specific diseases. Small concentration differences
    can detect whether someone is healthy or ill.  This requires highly sensitive,
    selective and durable sensors that can perform in high humidity.  The core platform
    is a Reactive Spray Deposition technology, a proprietary sensor manufacturing
    technology that creates a porous nanostructure metal oxides grains layer, and
    is able to provide results with a fast response time at a low cost. This results
    from the ability to easily and inexpensively produce different morphologies of
    materials from the vapor phase in the open atmosphere in a one-step process. The
    end-product of this project will be a prototype utilizing a single sensor for
    detection of NH3.  It will include a novel breath delivery system and associated
    signal processing algorithms for quantification of the gas concentration in breath,
    based on the sensor response."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of a unique wearable
    scuba-diving device that will eliminate the risk of Decompression Sickness (DCS),
    by monitoring in real time the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body of the
    user while in the dive. The risk to develop DCS while conducting underwater activities
    occurs during the ascension phase, when the changing pressure may yield the formation
    of nitrogen bubbles in tissues and body. The presence of bubbles triggers a variety
    of serious injuries with long term consequences and even death. Any professional
    and licensed recreational scuba training makes trainees aware about the risks
    associated to DCS. Divers are instructed to follow ascent rates and safety stops
    according with criteria established from statistical considerations of empirical
    data. Nevertheless, DCS is suffered by rule-abiding divers during 3% of the immersions,
    requiring costly and distressing evacuation and treatment with hyperbaric chambers.
    The wearable device will alert the scuba-diver before the sickness develops, reducing

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a superior alternative to the current frontline treatment for children?s Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The primary treatment option has a host of negative side effects resulting from the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugated to the L-asparaginase enzyme. Antibodies made against this drug can cause the body to eliminate it rapidly or result in a severe allergic reaction and even death, particularly after multiple injections (induced immunity). PEG has been utilized extensively in the food, cosmetics and agricultural industries. As a result, the majority of healthy people test positive for anti-PEG antibodies (pre-existing immunity), causing the elimination of PEG-modified drugs before their action. The technology proposed here utilizes the non-essential amino acid, glycine betaine, to construct a new poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) polymer for conjugation that is not recognized as a foreign molecule by the immune system. Therefore, it will maintain function and mitigate the negative side effects associated with the immune system that are attributed to the current therapy. Additionally, therapy with PCB conjugates avoids pre-existing immunity to PEG and ensures treatment efficacy. The primary goal of this work is to show that the technology is superior to and safer than the current PEG technology.

    The technical innovation at the foundation of this work is the zwitterionic, poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) polymer and its use as a bio-conjugate to replace the widely used poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for the treatment of children?s Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The unique properties of the zwitterionic polymer impart remarkable characteristics to the bio-conjugate that truly eliminates immunogenicity. The current frontline treatment suffers from Accelerated Blood Clearance (ABC) in patients, which has been attributed to induced or pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies. This Phase I project aims to demonstrate that PCB is a preferable bio-conjugation polymer to PEG for the modification of L-asparaginase with regard to extended half-life and decreased immunogenicity after multiple doses in mice. To achieve the goals, an optimized PCB L-asparaginase will be developed with regard to polymer length and conjugation density and a multi-dose pharmacokinetic/immunogenicity study will be performed to evaluate its half-life and immune protection in animals. All results will be compared with those from its PEG counterpart. It is expected that PCB L-asparaginase has great potential to eradicate the serious side effects associated with the current therapy. If PCB L-asparaginase proves to be safe and effective, this will lead to more successful outcomes for the treatment of ALL.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel set of materials for additive manufacturing technologies.  Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $5bn industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture new and innovative products.  It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing economy.  Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion of the available material library.  3D printing materials are limited to a small segment of the plastics in common industrial use today.  This project will expand that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with a broad range of flexibilities.  These materials will be particularly relevant for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear.  Manufacturers of flexible, durable polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance that match their product specifications.  The printing system will enable production of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material printing for novel product designs.


    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range.  The materials will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle liquid, reactive feeds.  The research approach will include determination of the starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.  Reaction kinetics control will be critical to develop a robust printing process and to overcome issues with print-direction strength that are common in extrusion printing processes. Raw material reactivity, catalyst selection, and relative concentrations of formulation components will be key experimental parameters.  Accessing a range of flexibility will require building formulas with varied molecular weights, and these formula variations will be balanced with resin printability.   This 3D printing technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.

    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a biofungicide for application

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to significantly improve the patient experience by providing easy, convenient, and fast delivery of protein therapeutics through the administration of high-concentration, low-viscosity solutions via subcutaneous injection. Currently, high-concentration antibody solutions have viscosities far above the recommended limit for subcutaneous injections. This project aims to drastically lower the viscosities of high-concentration protein formulations. The success of this project would greatly benefit patients by providing a much shorter administration time for drugs that now require hours of intravenous infusion. In addition, this solution can also improve therapies that are already administered subcutaneously by reducing the frequency of injections by increasing dosage. Development of this technology can also enable the development of protein therapeutics with promising efficacy, but intractable solution properties or commercially unattractive patent lives.

    The goal of this Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept data supporting the viability of a new formulation platform for proteins. This platform will generate a formulation containing high concentrations of protein therapeutics which may be delivered at substantially lowered viscosities due to a reduction in the intermolecular interactions among proteins. The formulation thus provides a subcutaneous syringe-compatible route to delivering biologics at high-concentration, and low-viscosity, ultimately driving a shift from timely intravenous delivery protocols to simplified subcutaneous injections. Constraints on subcutaneous delivery volume (<2 mL) necessitate antibody concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL. Unfortunately, viscosities far beyond the accepted injection limit (50 cP) are typical of this situation due to extensive interaction among the protein molecules. Current viscosity reduction methods attempt to regulate these interactions but have yet to substantially address the issue. The proposed work utilizes a novel process to gently formulate proteins using only FDA-approved materials. This approach eliminates the effect of the protein-protein interactions on the solution viscosity. The proposed project will involve development of the platform through (i) identification of optimal formulation parameters, (ii) demonstration of rheological improvements to high-concentration protein solutions, and (iii) demonstration of preservation of biological structure and activity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require more modeling to be codified and bring more stakeholders into the fold. Organizations need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that are capable of handling this wider range of data, are fully accessible to non-technical users, and allow more stakeholders to participate in this important process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. On one end, spreadsheets serve as a general-purpose, ad hoc modeling tool that is open-ended and accessible for many, and on the other, whole software applications whether packaged or custom developed are generally more powerful in important ways but usually sacrifice accessibility and generalizability. This project will produce a prototype of a collaborative integrated development environment for modeling that manages code and data. The technical feasibility of this prototype will be evaluated by developing a test framework that simulates the divergence and convergence of models and scores the outcomes. The commercial feasibility will be evaluated by testing with users building real models to understand the scope of functionality required to bring this to market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide robust, automated security protections to enterprise web applications. With the growing threat of attacks at the web application layer, security is a top of mind concern for both the developers and users of web applications. At the same time, defending against these attacks is a resource-intensive, error-prone process that typically is performed manually by specialized web security experts. The project will use application-aware analysis and an innovative information model to automatically build and deploy web security policies on enterprise servers, freeing the enterprise to focus on their core business and reduce the overhead of internal security teams. The project will also use a hybrid static/dynamic analysis to automatically craft server-side and client-side policies using modern web protection mechanisms to give users of web applications confidence that their interactions with a web application will be secure. This approach leverages cutting-edge techniques from program analysis and machine learning, and will advance the state of the art in automated security policy generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore ways in which automated security policies enact meaningful protection of sensitive resources. Protecting web applications is a challenging research problem in that automated approaches are either biased towards significant false positive rates, in which benign behavior is flagged as malicious, or significant false negative rates, in which malicious activity is not detected. This project aims to resolve this bias using application aware whitelists: the project automatically explores an application's behavior dynamically, and will also statically build a model of that application's purpose. The project is expected to yield two major components: a server-side protection module to isolate and harden sensitive resources on an enterprise deployment, and a client-side protection module to enforce fine-grained policies for users of the enterprise's web applications. The project will involve developing, analyzing, and improving both of these components using large-scale web applications and will integrate the experience and challenges of enterprises with leading web applications.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project appears in three areas.  First, there is an $8B
    dollar market for legacy hardware network security products today that is in transition
    to Software Defined Security. Adoption of this general SDSec platform has the
    potential to accelerate that market transition and improve enterprise security.
    \ Second, this project's success as an open platform could dramatically shorten
    the time between research insight and at-scale production deployments; security
    software built to a lower bar of scale/resiliency is faster and easier to build.
    The end result will be an increased rate of innovation, and new markets for niche,
    fit-for-purpose security functions that today are not profitable for vendors to
    build.  Last, this platform could harmonize enterprise security investments and
    practices for on premise workloads with security investments for public cloud
    workloads, solving a key dilemma faced by leading IT organizations. This will
    make those organizations more competitive on the world stage.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the two hardest technical
    challenges in building an enterprise-grade network security function, scale and
    resiliency, in a general way that can be applied to both new products and legacy
    codebases with no code change. Addressing scale/resiliency problems in a general
    way across many network security functions is novel, and this particular approach
    of massively parallel, lightweight packet processing functions to achieve this
    is new to this domain.  Why now? The massively parallel design proposed here is
    far too expensive and impractical with traditional hardware-based network functions.
    Even traditional hypervisor-based virtual machines carry too much hardware overhead
    to make this design cost competitive. By using vSwitches and network security
    functions packaged as Linux containers, the hardware overhead cost per instance
    drops dramatically, and this class of approach for scale/resiliency may be proven
    practical."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new approach to analyzing and understanding concisely structured documents such as legal contracts. The success of this project would provide a technological disruption in the way legal documents are processed. This will result in reduced processing time and financial savings in the review of legal contracts. Moreover, achieving this level of disruption within the legal market has the potential to open the door to automate processing, improve quality, and reduce the cost of many other legal services impacting the entire economy. With a market size of $437 Billion within the US alone, the legal industry is ready for a technological disruption that would bring this market up to par with other industries that have been significantly improved with the adoption of cutting edge Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This underlines the massive commercial potential for the technology under development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues a new innovative approach to understanding and analyzing contracts with accuracy comparable to what can be achieved by humans. Regardless of the technology, accuracy is the most important metric for lawyers to trust and adopt this innovation. Standard NLP techniques cannot generate the desired level of accuracy without a new approach to the problem.  The approach proposed for this project creates innovative custom-defined rules that operate using standard NLP technologies to break a contract into a data structure capturing different aspects of the contract meaning and allowing a higher level of understanding for the contract. In order to achieve the desired accuracy, a new innovative recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to learn over the extracted contract-meaning-data-structure which significantly improves the accuracy of the entire system. These two steps form somewhat orthogonal learning processes and when coupled with human-supervised-learning can produce the desired accuracy. This project will allow a full assessment of the underlying technology by training the core engine on a sufficiently large corpus of contracts to test the hypothesis on a larger scale.

    an environmentally benign yet highly effective marine antifouling coating for
    the American yacht market. The coating is a non-biocidal, foul release surface
    which does not require the vessel to move to obtain antifouling protection. It
    is a non-ablative multi-modal coating that will deter settling marine larvae when
    the vessel is stationary and will eliminate any attached marine organisms, such
    as barnacles through self-cleaning (e.g. fouling release) while underway. The
    commercial impact of the innovation will be in reducing consumption of non-renewable
    resources through increased fuel efficiency and possible expansion into additional
    markets. Such additional markets would include those for commercial vessels, Navy
    vessels, bridges, windmills, etc., while successfully reducing harmful chemicals
    in the marine environment. The market for these coatings is expected to double
    in the next four years, currently being at $10.2 billion. The findings from this
    development work will also be incorporated into research based educational programs.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of a promising synthetic
    conopeptide analog to the noradrenaline (NA) molecule. Prior art has shown that
    NA, when bound to a surface (or included as part of a coating covering a surface),
    deters fouling marine invertebrates from settling, thus preventing biofouling.
    Another distinct advantage of using conopeptide based systems is their stability
    in the marine environment. The current efforts are focused upon improving the
    efficacy and antifouling performance of these molecules. The phase I research
    objectives are (1) conjugation of the bioactive conopeptide additive to the current
    foul release coating; (2) demonstration of antifouling efficacy and proof of concept
    by bioassay; (3) development of batch coatings for scale-up for marine field tests.
    The results will be useful for designing new test coatings for scale up and testing
    in the marine environment."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make it cheaper and faster for architects, urban planners, and real-estate developers (APDs), as well as many others, to work with detailed models of the real world. Designers in APD fields must visualize and render their projects in the context of the real world. Pictures, videos, 3D printing, and even virtual reality inform the design process and facilitate communication with lay customers and stakeholders. These applications require consistently detailed models of the built world, and this project will automate the generation of these models. We estimate that APDs spend at least $80M annually creating these models by hand; and that at least $300M more is spent on such models for simulations, special effects, and video game design. By algorithmically generating virtual models without human intervention, the significant cost (in time and money) of manual creation will be saved, freeing design professionals to do work they want to be doing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed models of the world for diverse commercial applications. The first hurdle is solving the problem of reconstructing surfaces representing the boundaries of real-world solids (buildings) from noisy point cloud data. While surface reconstruction is well-studied in a variety of contexts, it remains an open problem in general, as successful algorithms must be informed by priors on the intended datasets. Using a data-driven approach to segment and classify input point clouds will facilitate the application of different reconstruction techniques to different objects (e.g. trees or buildings). The second hurdle is development of a machine learning algorithm which handles the dual problems of procedural modeling and inverse procedural modeling from a single statistical model, enabling visually realistic predictions about the details of a given building, even when that information is not available from source data (which may be of inconsistent quality across a large geographic area).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be large: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making; the project has the potential to make real estate sales and marketing more efficient by allowing buyers and sellers to accurately represent properties online, reducing the need for on-site visits. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second exciting effect of the proposal will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic 3D models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware, near instantaneous creation of 3D models on device, and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work might include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create a 3D model of a physical site in order to document it. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project relates to the fact that the extraction and consumption of fossil carbon accounts for over 6 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.  While some mitigation approaches are fairly mature, like capturing CO2 for equestration or for enhanced oil recovery, they are very expensive in terms of both variable and capital costs and have little chance of ever providing a return on investment.  By not viewing fossil fuels and feedstocks through a circular economy lens, we estimate these companies miss an opportunity for approximately $50 billion per year in potential profit from hydrocarbons, including methanol, that could be made with waste CO2. If successful, our HI-Light reactor will enable a new economy based on the conversion of fugitive CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and solve the return on investment problem.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HI-Light, a solar-thermocatalytic "reverse combustion" technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other hydrocarbons at rate significantly greater than the state of the art. Previous approaches are limited by two roadblocks: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented, multiscale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.  The unique features of our reactor are (1) optimized light delivery to ensure that all of the catalyst material has enough light to activate the reaction and (2) an advanced nano-engineered photocatalyst which is functionalized with ligands to enhance CO2 capture and conversion.  The goal of this Phase I effort is to construct an integrated prototype reactor and evaluate its productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour and demonstrate a 10x improvement over the state of the art.

    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer
    new business opportunities for small operators.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be

  title: 'STTR Phase I:  Novel Water Flooding Technique to Enhance Oil Recovery'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be the development of a dynamic thermal analysis system for use in aseptic food processing.  The true value of thermal properties for specific food products is required for the design of a thermal process to prevent possible bacterial contamination due to underheating, or degradation and formation of unwanted compounds due to overheating.  The proposed innovation would allow food processors to improve their understanding of thermal properties in rapid heating applications, and by validating novel food processing technologies. The impact is expected to be that the quality and nutritional value of aseptic processed foods should increase dramatically as it will eliminate the need to excessively overcook products to ensure their safety. The commercial impact of this research will be through enhancing the quality of aseptic processed food and of rapidly heated batter-based foods. As the aseptic food quality will be further enhanced compared to that of canned and frozen alternatives, this technology will also increase the growth of the rapidly growing aseptic food industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial prototype device capable of rapidly measuring the thermal properties of a material over a range of temperatures. Currently, there is no way to quickly measure properties, which are necessary for accurate modeling of rapid heating processes such as those used for aseptic food processing and for foods baked between hot irons, such as burgers. Without rapid measurement, the food product deteriorates before taking measurements. Phase I research should develop, build, and validate a physical prototype and associated software. Control and data acquisition software, along with data analysis and parameter estimation software, will be finalized and validated. The device will be tested against materials with known parameters to statistically validate its performance and accuracy. Finally the device will be tested alongside the prior state-of-the-art to compare its performance to the industry standard. The product of this research will be a commercially-viable prototype that has been validated against literature values and has been demonstrated to outperform current devices. The device will be able to measure parameters over a range of temperatures more accurately and in a fraction of the time of current methodology.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the improved financial resilience of the numerous
    industries that are reliant on stable water conditions. The innovation will enable
    the transfer and pooling of the financial risks posed by drought and flood in
    an increasingly efficient market. In the US, over $250B of industrial activity
    depends on stable freshwater systems across the energy, agricultural, and utility
    markets. Floods, droughts, freezes, and other conditions destroy roughly $10B
    in economic value annually in the US alone - value which cannot be recovered until
    it is accurately quantified and mapped to clear and measurable indicators. This
    SBIR research will enable the generation of accurate risk indices that bring clarity
    to the opaque and complex financial impacts of volatile water conditions. This
    will improve the accessibility, cost, and effectiveness of index-based insurance
    contracts, which provide businesses with crucial financial relief from the droughts
    and floods that hamper their operations. Such contracts also create new investment
    opportunities with diversification benefits for investors. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to overcome the technical challenges
    of seamlessly and scalably 1) combining and analyzing massive heterogeneous datasets
    relevant to hydrologic-financial risks, 2) managing a diverse set of models that
    cover hydrology, industrial operations, markets, and actuarial sciences, and 3)
    optimizing the configuration of data and models to generate accurate and precise
    risk indices. This project will construct and test a unified semantic data model
    for hydrologic-financial risk and deploy optimizations to maximize accuracy of
    the indices for a specific industrial use case. The architecture allows for the
    automated provisioning of disparate datasets and the deployment of best-in-class
    modeling and optimization tools to generate detailed risk indices. The research
    will create new vocabulary, when necessary, to bridge the gaps between existing
    ontologies in hydrology, industrial asset operations, actuarial analysis, and
    financial market conditions. If successful, the research will enable a dramatic
    reduction in both the time and cost required to produce hydrologic-financial risk
    analyses and the instances of errors in those analyses."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network infrastructure in data center networks.  While modern data centers leverage server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments in the lab have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The goal of this project is to run in a production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced with production conditions.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lies in treating clinical and subclinical inattention
    within a few minutes, by simply listening to algorithmically-generated music.
    Failures of attention have dramatic clinical and non-clinical ramifications. In
    the non-clinical side, nearly 90% of people attest to wasting time in the workplace,
    and this reduced efficiency has an estimated $1 T economic impact in the US alone.
    At the clinical level, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the best-characterized
    attentional deficit, affects over 8M children in the US, with the leading solution
    being a near-epidemic growth of prescriptions stimulants. However, over 4 M American
    adults do not meet all the criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD (and therefore cannot
    be prescribed medication), and have no convenient alternatives for treatment.
    Brain.fm is a non-invasive auditory stimulation platform designed to treat inattention.
    It generates music designed specifically to stimulate attentional networks in
    our brain by exploiting the latest neuroscience concepts of how neurons entrain
    to stimulus rhythms. Our objective is for Brain.fm to become a validated, non-invasive
    therapeutic tool for Attention to help everyone who suffers from mind wandering,
    regardless of whether they meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD. \n\nThe proposed
    project is aimed at experimentally demonstrating generalizable changes in attention
    through auditory stimulation. For decades, neuroscientists have observed wave-like
    activity in the brain and related them to attentional states. The ability to change
    attentional states, via noninvasive brain stimulation, would be greatly desirable
    for everyday functioning as well as crucial for understanding how brain waves
    relate to behavior. The proposed project tests a novel auditory neuroscience-informed
    platform solution for delivering noninvasive brain stimulation through music.
    In addition to establishing a revolutionary method to enhance attention noninvasively
    by tuning brain waves through comprehensive behavioral and fMRI studies, we test
    the efficacy of this method to treat inattention, especially in adults with Attention
    Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Key outcomes of this project are: 1) non
    clinical (but Institutional Review Board-approved) studies that determine how
    this auditory therapy impacts attention on an adult ADHD prone population, 2)
    a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of attention and neuronal
    entrainment, and 3)optimization of our product by testing different versions of
    our algorithmically generated music on our existing customer base. Results are
    expected to show how purpose-built acoustic stimulation can support the neuronal
    oscillations underlying sustained attention, thus boosting productivity and well-being."

    For patients, the system will provide personalized training, and, because it will

    of the upper extremity, it will largely improve patients' outcomes. For clinics,
    the system will increase revenues by increasing the number of visits per patient
    due to better outcomes and compliance, as well as the number of patients trained

    This STTR Phase I project is focused on improving the energy density, safety and ultra-low temperature capability of battery devices. Conventional batteries fall short of these critical requirements for next-generation electric vehicle technologies, which are necessary to reduce emissions and the nation?s reliance on fossil fuel imports. Although the eventual goal of the proposed technology is to enter automotive markets, it may have an equally strong impact for applications in other areas requiring energy storage at low-temperatures. For example, multiple efforts aim to enable high-atmosphere telecommunications to further global connectivity to the internet, particularly in remote locations of the globe in third world countries whose standard of living could be enhanced with greater communication and education. Further, the proposed chemistry could also potentially be useful in electrochemical deposition of difficult to plate metals such as titanium or silicon for use in the aerospace, medical or high tech industries, areas which will ensure the U.S. remains internationally competitive while increasing job opportunity and tax revenue from emerging technologies. It is also a priority of this STTR to coordinate with the partner research institution to providing training and internship opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented communities in this research work to further improve our national industry by training the next generation workforce to better be prepared for industry and higher-education.

    This project aims to develop a novel electrolyte chemistry for next generation energy storage devices which has potential to address these three critical areas (energy density, safety, wide temperature operation). While conventional electrolyte chemistry commonly uses solvent solutions which are typically liquid at room temperature, this project will explore the use of solvent solutions which are gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Preliminary work on this novel electrolyte chemistry has shown high performance at ultra-low temperatures, enabling many high-atmosphere and aerospace applications without need for additional thermal management and engineering. In addition, a reversible battery shut-down mechanism at high temperatures, inherent in the electrolyte chemistry, allow for strong mitigation of thermal runaway for improved battery safety. Finally, high potential for a substantial increase in energy density with use of next-generation electrode materials has been shown to be possible. The focus of this project will be to develop these novel electrolytes and demonstrate superior performance in a full cell device with application to the automotive industry and low-temperature markets. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and it is hoped these materials will lead to advances in next-generation energy storage devices and other technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to demonstrate a new way of integrating energy harvesting technologies in standard electronic circuits. This offers the opportunity to produce small sensors and devices in remote locations that can collect information, monitor conditions, and transmit data without the need to replace batteries. Small batteries are unsuitable for electronics that are remotely deployed, driving interest to harvest electrical energy directly from the movement and vibration of machinery. Currently, energy harvesting is too large, expensive, and inefficient for practical deployment. If energy harvesting can be made small and inexpensive, it can enable a large suite of products and services for industrial, civil, and agricultural remote monitoring. This project offers the potential to bring energy harvesting to electronics in a way that allows highly efficient energy conversion from vibrating or moving machinery, while maintaining small size and low cost. The ability to embed tiny moving parts directly within printed circuits is highly innovative, and dynamic energy harvesting is an excellent application of this technology. The patented manufacturing processes can be performed using domestic electronics manufacturing infrastructure helping to bring next-generation manufacturing to the U.S.

    The proposed project seeks to demonstrate a new way to embed dynamic energy harvesting devices directly within printed circuit boards, enabling micro energy production at low cost and small size. The project builds on patented manufacturing processes that leverages conventional electronics manufacturing infrastructure?devices can be built having feature sizes in microns without the need for expensive silicon fabrication foundries. The project will explore designs and fabrication processes for small, efficient vibrating units, culminating in the production of multiple devices in a single small footprint circuit board. Significant effort will be on the development of small, efficient vibrating units that can be manufactured cheaply and in large quantities, yet embedded directly within printed circuits. Three manufacturing rounds are anticipated, producing real devices that can be experimentally tested and measured. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate electrical energy production in a small printed circuit board (approximately the size of a credit card), targeting 100 microwatts to power sensing and telemetry electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is establishment of sustainable, cost-effective technology to mitigate local volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and other indoor air pollutants by using photocatalysts to effectively destroy them at their point of generation. VOC exposure is pervasive in many commercial environments, including nail salons, where employees work with materials that emit VOCs which can pose health risk without adequate protection. The proposed innovation addresses key gaps limiting the successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically the need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the use of visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as alternatives to the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lights currently employed for photocatalysis. Novel photocatalytic materials will be applied to achieve safe, facile implementation at the point of exposure in commercial activities where employees are directly impacted. An improved understanding of the activity of innovative photocatalysts in the visible light range will enhance the overall understanding of photocatalytic materials. The technology will also form the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential products, which will improve indoor air quality in homes. Together, these applications hold the promise to broadly impact society by providing improved health for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve indoor air quality by developing a technology platform to enable efficient and effective point-of-use VOC removal in commercial, residential, and select industrial environments. Photocatalysts are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants. When exposed to UV light, the surfaces become chemically active via formation of reactive oxygen species. This surface chemistry has been proven effective to decompose toxic VOCs and to kill spores, bacteria, and viruses. Because it is harmful to humans, the use of UV light to activate the photocatalyst greatly limits implementation of this technology. Additionally, ineffective photocatalyst designs can result in incomplete decomposition of the VOCs. The goal of the current research is to develop a visible-LED-activated photocatalyst engineered to completely convert target VOCs to carbon dioxide and water. The improvements to the photocatalyst design will enable its implementation in luminaires that are easily integrated into the work environment at the point of VOC generation. The decomposition of VOCs at concentrations typically found in commercial and home environments will be explored using the developed photocatalyst, with particular attention given to the mitigation of by-products and the enhancement of photocatalyst lifetime.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a much-needed novel prosthetic
    valve that will provide a potential treatment option for the millions of U.S.
    patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). As people age, valves
    in the veins of their legs begin to function poorly. This allows blood to build
    up in the ankles due to gravity, leading to pain/swelling of the feet, skin discoloration,
    and ultimately open wounds by the ankles. As there is no approved venous valve
    on the market, current treatment consists of palliative options such as wound
    care and skin grafts. These treatments can cost tens of thousands of dollars per
    patient for non-healing venous stasis ulcers. The proposed technology will work
    to treat CVI while mitigating complications associated with prior attempts at
    valve prostheses, including formation of blood clots and valve breakdown. The
    approach described leverages a minimally invasive approach, averting costly expenditure
    and offering an up to 40% reduction in the cost of care in the first year of treatment.
    \ \n\nThe proposed project aims to develop a novel prosthetic valve technology
    to treat incompetent veins by targeting the underlying cause of the disease. In
    order to successfully progress on the path to commercialization, it is necessary
    to validate technologies such as this on the bench and in long-term animal trials.
    \ These steps provide the foundation for future clinical trials and ultimately
    use in the broader population. The objectives are to build the device, compare
    iterations on the bench, and validate the technology in animals. We anticipate
    selecting an iteration and having successful animal results. The proposed project
    will allow for further validation of safety and function of the described approach
    and progress on the path to commercialization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The compact and torque-controllable proposed actuator will prompt the development of a highly-potential upper-body exoskeletal rehabilitation robot that support a wide range of motion with an anatomical mobility and impedance-based dynamic behaviors. The high-performed exoskeleton will allow to implement contemporary therapeutic trainings based on neurological motor learning principles. This would enhance the efficacy of robotic rehabilitation leading to better recovery after neuromuscular injuries. Therefore, rehabilitation robots powered by the proposed actuator will be better accepted to physical rehabilitation market and bring a significant commercial impact. Ultimately, this project will contribute to reduction of socio-economic costs caused by neuromuscular impairments. Also, exoskeletons powered by the proposed actuator would contribute to better understanding of neurobehavioral principle of human body by serving as an experimental tool that creates force-based human-robot interactions with anatomical movements.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a compact rotary-type series elastic actuators (SEAs) for upper-body exoskeleton application. A substantial portion of the US population suffers from neuromuscular impairments, requiring intensive rehabilitation services. Robotic rehabilitation has been attracting attention from many sectors because of the potential for better rehabilitation outcome. However, the lack of anatomical shoulder mobility and compliant dynamic control in existing upper-body exoskeletons limits the capability to produce neurologically-based therapeutic behaviors. The proposed SEAs will help to overcome the limitation by enabling exoskeletons to have force and impedance-based behaviors for advanced rehabilitation protocols. Its compact form factor will benefit the linkage design of exoskeletons for a wide range of motion and anatomical mobility. Also, the SEAs with the tight configuration and high torque/power capacity will provide a high flexibility in a variety of robot designs contributing to advances of general robotic technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.  This will provide fruit farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants.  This will potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US.  Better certainty may particularly help small growers, because they have less existing capability to manage risk.  Furthermore, by allowing adoption of precision agriculture techniques techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and chemicals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of vision-based fruit detection and mapping of fruit, for purposes of yield mapping.  The research objectives are to improve the commercial usability and robustness of existing yield-mapping approaches, so that they can be applied in production fruit orchards.  The anticipated technical results of this project include demonstration of useful yield mapping of apples, in a variety of real world production orchard environments, in a variety of weather and lighting conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is maximizing chances for improved health, academic success, and post-secondary achievement of students who use School Based Health Centers (SBHCs) through creating more efficient, tailored services. These gains will contribute to students' improved social, economic, and health outcomes as adults, and a healthier U.S. population overall. The School-based Wellness Integrated Systems Hub (SWISH) will offer a comprehensive, online service documentation and data management system designed specifically for SBHCs. In contrast with traditional electronic health record systems, SWISH will serve as a single hub between data sources, eliminating the need for multiple systems. SWISH offers mechanisms for staff to identify clinical service priorities and those students in need of care. The platform, which complies with health, security and privacy regulations, provides functionality that supports the assessment, triage, coordination and provision of care across multiple roles within SBHCs. SWISH will also facilitate evaluation of service impact on student health, wellbeing and academic performance. This capability - not provided by existing market solutions - serves program efficiency and effectiveness goals and is likely to be well received by SBHC staff and administrators leading to robust commercialization of the product.

    The proposed project will develop and test a prototype data management system for School Based Health Centers (SBHCs). SBHCs are proliferating in the U.S; they are well positioned to address the unmet physical and mental health needs of underserved youth by increasing accessibility and continuity of health care on the school campus. Notably, while health information technology systems play a critical role in SBHC quality improvement, operations, and sustainability, a minority of SBHCs report having a data management system in place. This represents a critical infrastructure gap. The proposed technology will address this gap by providing a secure, shared environment specifically designed for SBHC providers to document service, utilize "smart list" algorithms to identify students in need of services, serve students efficiently, and coordinate care and resources within and outside the SBHC. To achieve these goals, the project team will: 1) apply their expertise in design, technology and project management to the creation of a Minimally Viable Product prototype; and 2) usability test SWISH with members of the target audience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a significant increase in the efficiency of hospital operations.  The project focuses on the sources of inefficiencies in the planning, staffing, coordination, and execution of surgical procedures.  Preliminary analysis of hospital data shows that the throughput of perioperative units can be increased significantly with the same staffing while reducing the delays that patients experience and improving the working conditions of the personnel.  Such improvements have the potential of saving upwards of $1B per year. Delays in obtaining and communicating updates on the status of surgeries and on actions that personnel should perform are major causes of inefficiency, as is the randomness of the tasks' duration. The timing of those messages depends on the knowledge of the state of the system and a prediction about its future evolution. Delays in gathering information and incorrect predictions of the effect of actions result in reduced efficiency.  The proposed innovation improves the selection and timing of messages.

    The proposed project is based on a machine learning approach for the optimization of real-time messaging using actual hospital data. The approach combines new parametric models of real-time scheduling, stochastic gradient descent, and infinitesimal perturbation analysis. In this formulation, perturbation analysis computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to the timing of messages and results in an efficient algorithm.  The algorithm discovers the best time to send messages to optimize a combination of operating room efficiency and patient waiting times. The methodology is able to evaluate the complex cascading impact of scheduling decisions and to identify the best course of action when dealing with contingencies. Timely situation awareness will contribute to improved patient flow in the hospital.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop the necessary technology and manufacturing workflows to provide medical professionals with extremely realistic physical models of tissues and organs. The models will be manufactured rapidly (within a few hours), inexpensively, and on-demand. They will be patient-specific based on the patient?s CT and MRI scan data.  This will have profound implications on the planning of complex medical procedures such as tumor removal and will enable medical professionals and their teams to practice patient-specific surgical scenarios. This will improve surgical outcome, generate efficiencies in the operating room and decrease medical errors which, by some accounts, are the third largest cause of death in the United States. The ability to 3D print realistic human organ models will also provide medical students with a way to practice medical procedures with a wide degree of diversity. This will accelerate the learning rate and expand the breadth of training experiences.  Similarly, the models will provide a way for medical professionals to practice rare, high-risk procedures on-demand. The proposed 3D models will become a central part of the medical simulation toolbox and will enable a new generation of surgical planning and education.

    The ability to manufacture extremely realistic physical models rapidly, inexpensively, and on-demand relies on a novel multimaterial additive manufacturing process with a closed-feedback loop enabled by machine vision. This new process manufactures objects layer by layer, each layer made from a discrete set of elements, where each element is built from one material from a pallette of materials. The use of the closed-feedback loop system allows incorporating both liquids and solids with a wide range of mechanical and appearance properties. The development of a material palette that is necessary to mimic properties of real tissues will be a crucial part of the project. This material palette will be expanded by spatially combining base materials into composite structures. The second main thrust of the project relies on a software design workflow that translates geometric and material specifications describing a simulation model (e.g., an organ or a tissue) into multimaterial volumetric data. The volumetric data will be used as input to the multimaterial printing platform. The new design workflow requires development of modeling approaches that go beyond traditional, boundary-based CAD representations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make solar generation more efficient and more affordable.  Consequently, it promotes a safer and greener environment.  The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to revolutionize solar generation.  Therefore, it gives the U.S. a technological and commercial competitive edge in the global renewable energy market.  Also, this project will expose interns to discovery-based exercises and will train them to work on the design and development of solar PV energy systems.  In an attempt to diversify the workforce in the solar energy market, students from minority and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to engage in the research activities of this project.  This project also fosters potential research collaborations and communications between small businesses, universities, and research institutions.  Consequently, the project will enhance infrastructure for research and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes using GaN devices in string solar inverters.  The innovative aspect of this work is threefold.  i) Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices will be used in this effort.  ii) The proposed circuit topology is a novel inverter which utilizes coupled inductors to cancel the current ripples induced on the input and output sides of the converter.  iii) The proposed inverter acts as a synthetic frequency response reserve to improve the frequency stability of its local grid.  The proposed circuit topology is creative and allows for significant reduction in the size of the filtering elements.  Hence, the overall weight, volume, and cost of this solar inverter are lower than its predecessors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development and demonstration of a prototype position sensor that will help convert hydraulic and pneumatic actuators into ?smart? devices.  The position sensor will enable built-in self-diagnostics, precise feedback control, energy efficient operation, faster industrial manufacturing and material handling processes, and safer operations on mobile vehicles that take locations of obstacles and danger zones automatically into account during motion. The value proposition of the new sensor comes from its lower cost, ease of installation, and its non-contacting operation.  This project will help a start-up company demonstrate the performance of its sensor on multiple actuator products provided by large industrial and off-road mobile companies.  This is expected to result in establishing the viability of the sensor, customer orders for the sensor, and growth in company revenues. The technology area addressed by the research in this project is smart sensors and the targeted market sector is industrial machines and off-road agriculture and construction vehicles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a prototype position sensor that is production-ready and ready for field testing in real-world industrial and mobile vehicle applications.  The sensor utilizes a large-distance magnetic field model, redundant magnetic sensors on a single sensor board and adaptive estimation algorithms to provide a novel position sensor that is small, non-intrusive, non-contacting, easy to install and lower cost compared to other position sensors on the market.  The innovations in the sensor technology being developed include the use of a nonlinear estimation algorithm that avoids differentiation of complex nonlinear functions, provides more accuracy and is computationally efficient for implementation on a microprocessor.  The sensor also includes an auto-calibration algorithm that corrects for sensor location and orientation errors so as to ensure accurate performance with changing cylinders.  The research project will demonstrate the performance of the sensor prototype in the lab on multiple actuators provided by collaborating large industrial and off-road vehicle companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to innovate a novel patient tracking system, which will improve robotic surgery usability in an intra-operative environment. Robotic surgery is becoming ubiquitous across various medical procedures, and data continues to show improved clinical results. However, usability challenges impede broader adoption. This project will combine multiple tracking modalities, including mechanical and optical tracking, to create a hybrid tracking technology that allows for the advantages of each modality. This will optimize patient range of motion while minimizing line-of-sight challenges. This patient tracking technology can be used in conjunction with an existing robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures, which comprise a significant market opportunity. Dental implants are the standard of care for tooth replacement, and the dental implant market in the US is over $1 billion and growing nearly 8% per year with more than 14 million implants being placed annually worldwide. This technique can be used not only to revolutionize dental implant surgery, where the system is currently applied, but also to potentially create opportunities in other cranial procedures, which are otherwise burdened by invasive, cumbersome tracking technologies that impede intra-operative usability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the first hybrid patient tracking device that combines mechanical and optical tracking methods. Optical tracking systems require that cameras have direct line-of-sight to several tracked markers in the surgical field, which poses a significant challenge to the surgeon and assistants that have to carefully avoid blocking the camera's field-of-view. Mechanical tracking systems limit a patient's range of motion and can be bulky. The success of this project will lead to the development of a robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures that encompasses: 1) pre-operative CT-based planning software, 2) a visual guidance system that provides on-screen graphics like a GPS system, 3) a hybrid optical and mechanical tracking system that monitors the patient position, and 4) a robot arm that physically grasps the drill at the same time as the surgeon in order to provide haptic feedback, constraining the surgeon to match the planned osteotomy. This system enables minimally invasive, flapless surgery that is shown to result in less pain for the patient and faster surgery. It is designed to be easy to use and seamlessly integrate into the surgeon's workflow.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be achieved through shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular occurrence, giving way to reduced pollutant levels in waterways, since they will be promptly removed instead of allowing them to accumulate toxins, and increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the community and dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption and further development, the innovation could potentially have far-reaching benefits in assisting with water and energy security by keeping inlet canals and reservoirs that comprise our society?s infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will aim to design, develop, and test an intelligent suction tip for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways. Current sediment removal technologies are destructive to marine ecosystems and costly to employ. As such, this project aims to develop an intelligent suction tip for marine life avoidance during robotic sediment removal in waterways. The project activities include the design and rapid prototyping of a suction tip filter that prevents fish entrainment, design and implementation of water quality sensors for environmental niche modeling, in-house saltwater testing, and marine representative freshwater testing.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate a novel method for additively manufacturing textile products. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has essentially stalled, as 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3D Printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

    This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional textile products. To develop this technology, this project will first prove feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3D topography, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ. By additively producing garments from a unique 3D model, complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale- though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States' current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.

The innovative non-contact solution is free of the conventional wear and tear issues plaguing contact-based probing systems. The proposed technique could open up new research areas and directions that could have an immediate benefit to the entire semiconductor industry, thus broadly impacting all areas of our "information-driven" society. In particular, millimeter-wave and terahertz frequency bands (30-3000GHz) offer unique solutions to address key problems in sensing and spectroscopy, medical, pharmaceutical and security imaging, as well as extremely-high-data rate, ubiquitous communications. All-electronic integrated systems are badly needed for compact and cost effective applications in the above-mentioned areas. More importantly, testing and characterization of these new high-performance devices has been a challenge at their intended operation frequencies. Thus, there is ample need for comprehensive, high-performance metrology systems for characterizing entire electronic wafers automatically and without making physical contact. The automated probe system proposed here enables, for the first time, fast and accurate device and chip characterization, without making physical contact with the test wafer.

    The intellectual merit of this project is a novel non-contact probe system, based on wireless coupling of the test signals onto the test wafer, through on-chip antennas that are monolithically integrated with the test device. Since the physical contact to the test wafer is eliminated, there is no wear & tear to the chip or the test-bed, significantly improving reliability and repeatability as well as eliminating much of the associated testing costs. This innovative solution is scalable, and offers a comprehensive, elegant and cost-effective solution for single or differential-mode on-wafer characterization for the first time. Although the physical size of the on-chip antennas are slightly larger than typical contact-probe landing pads, the overall cost-savings in operation, labor, and maintenance offered by this innovative approach readily outweighs the on-chip real-estate occupied by the integrated antennas. Perhaps more importantly, this novel test-bed enables fully-automated, unattended testing of every single chip on an entire electronic wafer, even enabling continuous processing of multiple wafers without user involvement, thus providing significant savings in overall testing costs for high-speed electronic devices.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will focus on the development of a new
    alternative to Diesel engines for use in heavy-duty applications such as on-road
    transportation, off-road farm equipment, and stationary power generation. Currently,
    Diesel engines are used in all of these applications because they are robust and
    powerful. Unfortunately, they also produce significant smog, soot, and greenhouse
    gases that are damaging to individuals and the environment. In contrast, the engines
    developed under this project will have cleaner exhaust while producing more power
    at increased efficiency, all while utilizing inexpensive alternative fuels. Since
    Diesel-fueled engines move 70% of the world's goods, and produce 30% of distributed
    power around the globe, these engines are inextricably linked to quality of life,
    and transformational improvements in their operation can have a large, broad,
    positive impact on society. This project's new engines will continue to provide
    essential services, but in a way that reduces operating costs (creating savings
    that can be passed on to consumers) and emissions (further saving consumers money,
    and improving air quality in heavily-trafficked regions). These engines will fulfill
    a critical market need for clean, powerful engine solutions, and can be integrated
    into existing American-made engine product lines, increasing manufacturing revenue,
    stimulating job creation, and ensuring that the United States will remain a global
    leader heavy-duty engine production.\n\n \nThis project will focus on enabling
    these clean, powerful engines by developing a novel, high-temperature combustion
    system that allows traditional engines to be adapted to burn alternative fuels
    in an efficient and soot-free manner. This requires integration of a unique combination
    of technologies, joined in a way that provides benefits far greater than those
    that can be achieved with the individual components in isolation. Removing any
    piece from this specific combination drastically reduces performance. Because
    each component plays a critical role, this project has high risk (as each subsystem
    must function properly), but its sophistication also presents a high barrier to
    similar efforts (since incorrect use of any component yields significantly worse
    results). This project will build on previous proof-of-concept data that verified
    the feasibility of this concept, and will focus on the development of key engine
    subsystems, seeking to mitigate risk enough that investment from the private sector
    is possible. At the end of the project, the subsystems will be integrated into
    a stationary power generator as a retrofit to an existing Diesel engine, adapting
    it for alternative fuel use. This would serve as a prototype platform for the
    technology?illustrating its increased efficiency and power, along with reduced
    emissions?and demonstrating the value of the technology to market incumbents,
    hopefully spurring a licensing arrangement for engine production."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to help environmental engineers identify and delineate the bounds and concentrations of soil and groundwater contaminants with greater speed and accuracy. Over 30,000 contaminant spills have been identified in the United States alone, with thousands yet to be investigated and returned to safe levels.  The resources and effort being applied to these sites is insufficient to ensure the safety of the affected communities across America.  Focusing the remediation resources available, in the right place increases the rate at which federal and state regulators can close site investigations. As a result, environmental professionals will perform remediation earlier, making the site safe and productive again for local communities. The innovations developed in this project will enhance understanding of contaminant migration and develop a technical capability to use these findings to prepare more accurate conceptual site models during a contaminant investigation.  Faster site models resulting in successful remediation directly translates into cost savings for environmental clean-ups, reduction in damage to the environment, as well as increased throughput and efficiency for the environmental engineering industry.

         This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create unique summary models for the flow, extent, depth, and shape of contaminant plumes, with the goal of targeting resources to accelerate the remediation process for local communities. The project leverages algorithmically derived models of contaminant migration combined with public and private data from decades of environmental investigations across the country. Once the data are aggregated and analyzed, the project team will produce a collection of guideline statistics and software tools for use by engineers investigating future sites that are mathematically similar to those in the combined database. The project uses predictive algorithms to determine the likely extent of underground contaminations and applies statistical uncertainty measures to the conceptual site model. These mechanisms will enable environmental professionals to understand when and where additional data is required. In addition, by using a more accurate and sophisticated measure of uncertainty, the project?s models will provide definitive guidance to field engineers on where to collect new sample data and where they have sufficient certainty to remediate the site using excavation or other means.  These innovations will lead to the goal of safer and cleaner communities in less time, with fewer costs, with reduced environmental damage.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate a reliable, low cost solid-state device for harvesting the wasted thermal energy released during regasification of LNG at gas terminals around the world. The proposed device will include thermoelectric elements incorporated directly into the LNG gasification heat exchanger, in order to harvest the temperature difference between cryogenic liquid and vaporized natural gas. Today, approximately 180 Billion kWh of energy (roughly equivalent to 5% of the total annual electricity consumption of the United States) is wasted annually at regasification terminals around the world, representing a huge addressable market for the proposed technology. Additionally, the proposed technology will benefit the US economy by making American LNG more cost-competitive in export markets.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of a thermoelectric generator integrated directly into an LNG regasification heat exchanger in order to effectively recover the latent energy released during regasification of LNG and convert it to electricity. The current state-of-the-art is based on gas turbines and expanders that rely on a combination of Rankine cycle and Brayton cycle. These technologies are complex, capital intensive, and costly to maintain. Consequently, they are seldom deployed at regasification terminals, resulting in massive energy waste. Direct conversion of the waste thermal energy to electricity through ?cryogenic? thermoelectrics is a practical and cost effective option. The proposed research will develop and demonstrate a laboratory prototype device integrated within a model plate-type LNG regasification heat exchanger. The main tasks include design of the system architecture, characterization of thermoelectric materials in cryogenic temperatures, modeling of heat transfer, prototype fabrication, and testing. Research will target design and process intensification, in order to minimize device cost.

    Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the US solar cell market with low-cost
    and high-efficiency solar cells. The development of cost-effective and efficient
    solar power technologies is of national interest because solar power has broad
    potential to support US priorities such as economic growth and job creation, as
    well as mitigation of climate change. However, the cost of solar energy is still
    high, and technological innovations are needed to further lower costs and increase
    efficiency. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells has surged to over 22% in
    five years of research and now rivals that of CdTe and Si-based solar panels.
    Perovskite inks are made from Earth-abundant, inexpensive precursors and can be
    printed on plastic foils, which can significantly reduce their manufacturing and
    installation costs. However, before commercialization of this technology can be
    considered, device stability and the feasibility of reliable, scalable manufacturing
    of large-area panels have to be established. This project will bridge this critical
    knowledge gap and develop manufacturing technology that can compete in terms of
    cost and performance not only with other solar panels but also with conventional
    fossil fuel-based energy sources. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    scalable, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective technology to manufacture
    perovskite photovoltaic devices using an industry-proven slot die coating technique.
    Most research lab perovskite solar cell devices are fabricated via spin casting,
    and have a device area of less 1 sq. cm. Despite the impressive progress of this
    technology, its commercially viable scalability and reliability have not yet been
    demonstrated. In this project, slot-die coating will be used, which is a proven
    technology to be scalable for large area processing and robust for high-yield
    manufacturing in a wide range of applications. We will use the slot die coating
    method and air stable p-i-n devices architecture to manufacture perovskite solar
    panel with a target power conversion efficiency of 20%, operational lifetime of
    more than 10,000 hours, power-to-weight ratio of 1 kW/kg, and target manufacturing
    cost of less than $0.3/W, which is more than a 40% reduction in costs when compared
    to industry leading photovoltaic technologies."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to significantly increase recovery efficiency and decrease ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is decreased by reducing the amount of water required to produce oil and gas from many low permeability U.S. unconventional plays. Further, it will provide access to the vast reserves of potential oil and gas (estimated at greater than 2 trillion barrels) stored as immature organic material helping to enhance energy independence for the US. The new methods will enhance production of oil and gas from a controllable volume surrounding development wells.  The proposed methods will replace the rapid declines in well productivity of fracked wells, and the accompanying typically less than 10% recovery of hydrocarbons in place, by a strategy which will construct multi-year oil and gas "factories" which will have continuous, predictable, twenty year production lifetimes. Increased recovery factors through increased efficiency will enhance the value of existing plays and provide a step-change in sustainable energy production while lowering environmental impact through reducing surface disruption and minimizing water use and disposal.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the models necessary to simulate
    the Radio Frequency (RF) waterless stimulation process, and to provide laboratory and numerical data to support that model. A self-consistent model of the RF system and its downhole environment, is required to define the conditions for which RF stimulation makes economic sense, and to optimize system design for a given target play. Project objectives are to 1) demonstrate design of a RF system which mitigates the previous problems found with RF heating, 2) test in the laboratory the effects of RF heating on reservoir rock subject to realistic in situ conditions to understand the resultant crack field and accompanying permeability enhancement, including the impact of RF heating on immature kerogen, 3) model the resulting stress and fracture fields with sufficient fidelity to make predictions for oil and gas recovery, and 4) use this information to form a self consistent model of the process so that various shale plays can be evaluated. A commercial multiphysics numerical modeling approach will be used to simulate the physical processes that occur including feedback to account for temperature increases and the impacts of in situ stress and structural complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make uniformly high quality practice by Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) accessible to non-ambulatory and underserved rural populations. Because the inability to engage in spoken communication is among the most debilitating of all human conditions, poor access to high quality speech-language pathology services is an important societal issue. It creates significant health disparities affecting not only the quality of peoples' lives but also the economics of their communities. Because speech-language pathology treatment is highly behavioral and intensive, any proposed solution must improve both the performance and productivity of individual SLPs. To provide the necessary scalability required for a nation-wide problem, any implementation must include networked mobile tools as well as a strong algorithmic foundation that automatically generates objective, reliable, and sensitive outcome measures. The project has the potential for significant commercial impact. There are currently 160K SLPs in the US and that number expected to exceed 240K by 2024. Following a software-as-a-service model where clinicians freely download software to their mobile device but need active a subscription to access outcome ratings, projects to a total clinical market of between $20M and $100M.

    The proposed project addresses the strong demand for the development of dependent objective measures of pathological speech that exists in a variety of clinical settings. Currently, perceptual (subjective) ratings of speech conducted by clinicians are the gold standard for evaluating speech improvement or decline. While it is acknowledged that subjective ratings have poor validity and reliability, objective measures have not been readily available. This project takes a novel intellectual approach to the problem by building machine-learning algorithms that objectively model experts' subjective ratings, but with levels of reliability that far exceed that of clinicians. The computational engine takes as an input a set of speech samples from a speaker and automatically evaluates the speech along clinically-standard perceptual dimensions. This yields outputs that are immediately clinical interpretable, thereby exceeding the value of norm-based objective outcomes. The project goals are, (i) to refine and extend existing technology for the evaluation of pathological speech; and (ii) to rigorously evaluate its performance and utility using beta testing. Statistical analyses will determine whether the model outperforms the human ratings with respect to reliability and sensitivity, as has been the case in pilot tests.

    a metallic joint replacement. However, qualifying patient age is 55 or older.
    There are several implants available to a younger and more active patient population,

    lesions often are associated with a low rate of success and high patient morbidity
    (meaning 60% treatment failure) due to the need for adequate vasculature in the
    subchondral bone and integration with the cartilage graft. Researchers have used
    complex biomimetic nanomaterials and 3D printing to create strategies for joint
    repair. These materials work well in a controlled laboratory setting, but as is
    can only be printed using deposition or extrusion-based 3D printing techniques.
    This type of additive manufacturing is limited by resolution and print speed /
    volume when compared to commercial laser-based systems. The significance of this
    project is tied into improving clinical outcomes, with a more mechanically and
    biologically stable implant, while also addressing these manufacturing and cost
    issues. Thus, this project will validate the efficacy of an implantable cartilage

    selective laser sintering, and provide critical scientific validation of a functional

    This SBIR Phase I Project is designed to enable the wide acceptance of hydrogen as a green alternative to gasoline and diesel.  To accomplish this goal, a way had to be found to safely and economically store, transport and use hydrogen.  A class of organic compounds has been discovered that can store hydrogen, release it as needed, and form a recyclable residual compounds. By holding hydrogen on a liquid carrier at normal temperatures and pressures, the cost and complexity of compressing or liquefying hydrogen has been eliminated.  The same infrastructure that supplies us with gasoline, diesel and ethanol can be used without modification to transport this hydrogen liquid. A safe and economical means for capturing, storing, transporting and dispensing hydrogen will enable green technologies for making hydrogen from wind, solar, biomass and tidal energy.  Possibilities exist for using CO2 as a component to make these carrier molecules from hydrated ethanol. Hydrogen can be mixed 50/50 with diesel fuel to cut harmful diesel emissions in half including diesel soot which has been implicated in the rise in childhood asthma.

    This project combines the skills of organic chemists, nanotechnology, 3D fabrication engineers and computer-controlled electronics drivers to deliver a novel result. Achieving uniform heating of a catalytic volume is key to producing the desired output without byproducts and fouling of the catalytic surfaces. Since the anticipated reactions are endothermic and the flow rates for commercial applications are high, the research is focused on developing precise control of heat transfer into the reactor core through design and experiments. The experimental plan also involves evaluation of multiple materials for the induction heating elements, the effect of location in the solenoid barrel of the reactor core, and the various methods available to bind multiple, very small Reactor tubes together to create the Cores. The goal is to demonstrate capability for generating hydrogen output of 33 gaseous liters per
    minute for a 5 kW fuel cell.

This rapidly emerging technology is compatible with existing silicon photovoltaics and can be combined with them to enhance their efficiencies, or can be used as stand-alone devices that can ultimate meet or exceed the performance of silicon while enabling an intrinsically inexpensive and scalable manufacturing process. Initial studies predict an estimated cost of production of modules lower than $0.28/W after amortization of initial capital investment, which translates into a cost of production ~30% lower than that of current photovoltaic technologies.

    The proposed project will provide a solution to a key degradation mechanism that affects the lifetime performance of perovskite photovoltaics. Degradation is caused by trapping of charges at the interface between the light absorbing perovskite layer and the electron transport layer, typically TiO2, which leads to the breakdown of the perovskite structure through a sequence of chemical reactions. In this project TiO2 will be replaced by SnO2 (either intrinsic or doped) which has an electronic band structure that matches very closely with new high efficiency perovskite compositions. Additionally, SnO2 is considerable less expensive than TiO2, easier to deposit with high quality, i.e. low density of electronic defects,  and it is more environmentally robust in the presence of moisture and oxygen than TiO2. SnO2 also does not photocatalyze degradation pathways of the perovskite layer, which is recently thought to be occurring with TiO2. Preliminary laboratory work using SnO2 as an electron transport layer yielded efficiencies comparable to cells manufactured using TiO2 (~18%), but more importantly, tests showed virtually no degradation after 500 hours of operation. Our goal is to further improve the properties of the perovskite cells (efficiency and stability) while developing a robust, inexpensive deposition process for SnO2.

    The broad impact of this SBIR Phase I project is  in the development of a new cokeless process to melt iron and scrap steel while meeting  stringent environmental regulations. The process being investigated will potentially shift the paradigm of difficult pollution control to the use of a clean fuel, such as natural gas.  It has the potential to cut down 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions by comparison with coke fired cupolas that continue to cover 70% of the world production of castings. By leveraging the existing network of natural gas pipelines, it intends to put back the US at the forefront of developing clean technologies for metal casting and provide opportunities to expand to new foundries.

    The proposal focuses on a specially designed furnace that primarily incorporates two interconnected chambers with two different zones of melting and superheating. This design is aimed at overcoming the limitations of natural gas fired cokeless cupolas and rotary furnaces,and rapidly dwindling coke-fired open hearth furnaces.  The key objective of this project is to demonstrate  that the innovative furnace can melt pig iron at the required rate, but with lower pollution emissions than competitive technologies, and in compliance with stringent environmental regulations. In particular emissions of CO2, lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates will be lowered by finding a range of favorable operating conditions through systematic experimentation. Slag damage to  furnace lining will also be managed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a dialysis-like platform for selective bacterial separation and removal from blood. This technology could potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapy for the treatment of disease, including sepsis. Sepsis, a life threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection, is a condition where the risk of death is extremely high (25%-72%), yet no effective treatments exist. In the US, over 1M people suffer from sepsis annually. Sepsis is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, costing more than $20 billion per year. There are currently no approved therapies in the US to treat sepsis. This developing technology will serve as an effective, next-generation sepsis treatment through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from blood. The technology in this project holds many advantages over competitors, including increased effectiveness, hemocompatibility, elimination of pore size limitations, and elimination of clogging issues. Commercialization of this innovation may reduce sepsis-associated length of stay, decrease mortality rates, and potentially reduce the current $23.7B annual US expenditure for sepsis. Fundamental understanding generated by this work has alternative applications, including the development of diagnostic devices for rapid infection detection.

    The proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of a novel, fluidic platform to provide a more effective and rapid method of bacterial and endotoxin removal from circulation for the treatment of sepsis. Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and no effective therapy exists for the syndrome. The anticipated research involves 1) scale up of the device for operation at flow rates suitable for humans, 2) developing features for bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) evaluation of the rate of bacterial and endotoxin capture from fluid circulating through the scaled-up fluidic platform. It is anticipated that this work will result in a fluidic platform capable of removing pathogens and associated toxins from blood at a clinically translatable flow rate. The goal of this work is to provide an easy to use, cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and capture of bacteria and associated toxins from circulating fluid and to facilitate the use offluidic platforms as research tools. Successful completion of these studies will establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform and enable the subsequent development of a prototype device for field testing.

    \ \n\nThe proposed project promises to transform the standard of care for people
    who have lost limbs or were born without fully developed limbs.  Amputees using
    mechanically driven prostheses often experience increasing pain, as well as risk
    of skin breakdown and severe infections, even over the course of daily use, due
    to normal anatomical changes in the limb that are not accommodated by the static,
    rigid socket of their prosthetic device. Typically, most amputees' residual limbs
    shrink over the course of any given day, much like peoples' foot size changes
    from morning to evening.  This proposed work aims to resolve the inadequacies
    of current prosthetic socket fit by using flexible pads of EAP based synthetic
    muscle, built into prosthetic liners, to automatically respond to changes in patient
    anatomy and ensure a continuously proper socket fit throughout the day.  With
    the additional ability to sense pressure, these EAPs can also serve as a diagnostic
    tool to prevent skin breakdown. The prosthetic device and human should move as
    one, effortlessly and naturally.  This proposal will develop self-adjusting prosthetic
    liners that responds to residual limb changes, maintaining a comfortable dynamic
    perfect fit throughout the day, to allow the patient to easily and comfortably
    engage in an active lifestyle."

    high risk technology for treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
    The technology is an AAV2-mediated concurrent expression of recombinant proteins
    to intracellularly suppress the critical growth factors VEGF-A (vascular endothelial
    growth factor A) and PDGF-B (platelet-derived growth factor) in a single injection.
    \ AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the US. The standard of care intravitreal
    anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) injections (injected monthly)
    achieve an initial improvement in visual acuity in the first 3 or 4 months of
    treatment is followed by a plateau that persists for 2 years, followed by visual
    decline over the subsequent 5 years. Studies examining retinal remodeling provided
    initial clues as to the importance of VEGF and PDGF in wet AMD, while work in
    cancer models provided an impetus to pursue anti-VEGF/PDGF combination therapy
    for the treatment of wet AMD. This project will lead to an effective product for
    the treatment of wet AMD and related diseases.  A long-term VEGF inhibition and
    PDGF suppression without repetitive intravitreal injections would significantly
    reduce the number of intraocular injections and the risks of infection, bleeding,
    retinal detachment, fibrosis, and pain for the patient. \n\nThis project proposes
    an AAV2-delivery vehicle for expressing intraceptors which sequester VEGF-A and

    suppress VEGF-A and PDGF-B, using a bicistronic AAV2 vector.  The proposed studies
    in mice will determine feasibility for potential commercialization of this alternative
    which would be injected annually and provide long-term sustained suppression of
    the two key mediators of neovascular AMD, including the potential for reduced
    fibrosis (scarring) with PDGF-B blockade. Further, this therapy?s ability to block
    intracellular autocrine loops may complement or improve upon the efficacy of current
    extracellular treatments, while avoiding neurotoxicity of diffuse extracellular
    VEGF suppression. This project?s innovations earned a patent in 2012 (US Patent

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to develop a low-cost photovoltaic (PV) inverter is to reduce the installed cost of solar energy systems by ~10%. This improvement in power electronics has a direct positive commercial impact on the entire solar industry by greatly expanding the addressable market where solar generation is economic. Societal impacts include lowering energy costs, facilitating employment growth, driving economic development, and lowering emissions. The project also supports an enhanced scientific and technological understanding of a class of novel inverter architectures that may find numerous other applications outside of the solar industry. For example, industrial motor drives, wind turbines, battery energy storage, and electric vehicles each make use of DC-AC (direct current ? alternating current) conversion technologies that could benefit from these novel architectures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two major problems in the solar PV industry: (1) there is tremendous pressure to reduce costs in the DC-AC inverter, and (2) there is pressure to improve the performance of inverters, both by increasing energy yield under partial shading conditions and by improving the lifetime of inverters. The objectives of the proposed research are to demonstrate maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and grid synchronization for a prototype distributed inverter that can achieve performance comparable to commercial inverters while being mass-produced at a lower cost. The research includes a) refinement and application of a real-time inverter control algorithm to extract the maximum energy from solar panels under dynamic shading conditions, b) establishing robust communications across a network of distributed inverters, and c) fabricating and demonstrating a system with a pathway to performance parity with commercial inverters at a much lower cost. Anticipated technical results include measurement of conversion efficiency, power quality, component count, and bill of material estimates.

    leads to restricted design spaces and needs expensive full-scale device testing,
    which make the technology unfeasible for extensive application. The internal architecture
    of the high-performance materials to be studied and optimized in this work can
    enlarge the design space to embrace objects as small as an expensive equipment
    and as large as a major bridge. Simplification of testing protocols due to the
    shift of the isolation property from the device to the material level adds to
    the Broader Impacts by making seismic isolation accessible for a wide range of
    applications. The high level of seismic protection provided by this technology
    constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities that require continuity
    of operations after earthquakes. The initial target is the fast growing market
    of data centers, with the potential for follow-on market in residential housing
    construction. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of
    increasing the resiliency of communities in areas prone to seismic activity and
    reducing related direct and indirect losses. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this

    a fundamental study to optimize metamaterials based on manufacturing tolerances,

    developing a set of design principles for optimized internal material architectures

    carried out to validate the methodology and to prove the feasibility of replacing
    device testing with material coupon testing to certify metamaterial pads for seismic
    isolation. This will include the investigation of processing methods to manufacture
    material assemblies with uniform mechanical properties, and will involve both
    static and dynamic testing of the material. The key technical objectives of the
    project are 1) the development of the optimization design framework based on manufacturing
    and seismic performance constraints, and 2) the material testing protocol to verify
    scalability and defect insensitivity of the material property. It is anticipated

    This STTR Phase I projects aims to address major limitations in the analysis of pharmaceuticals that are based on proteins, a group of therapeutics known as biologics.  Current methods for sample preparation and analysis of these drugs require highly trained staff and expensive equipment to execute the multitude of different analytical approaches that are employed to characterize these molecules. Both personnel and equipment costs combine to limit the number of drug candidates evaluated by pharma companies, makes it more difficult for regulatory agencies to reproduce data provided in applications and makes it difficult to identify counterfeit drugs. The company aims to address this issue by creating a highly flexible sample preparation device based on a fluidic channel that operates at reduced pressure. Proteins trapped within the channel can undergo digestion, reduction, alkylation and other common sample preparation procedures in an unattended and automated fashion. Subsequently, prepared samples may be eluted at high concentration, ready for downstream analysis.  By dramatically reducing the equipment costs and reducing the required expertise for sample preparation, the company?s technology will have a large impact on the number of drug candidates that are evaluated by pharma companies, it will make it easier for regulatory agencies to reproduce data provided by manufacturers, and it will improve their ability to detect counterfeit drugs. All of these benefits will result in more and cheaper biologics making it to the market, ultimately improving the health and wellness of the populace.

    The company?s device combines concepts of diafiltration, asymmetric flow field flow fractionation and filter assisted sample preparation to create an automated sample preparation platform that avoids the use of robotics. By avoiding robotics and high pressure, the platform can operate with increased robustness and dramatically reduced cost. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the ability of the device to perform common sample preparation steps, such as reduction/denaturation, digestion, and deglycosylation and assess issues of reproducibility, reliability and carryover. While many of the workflows described herein have been demonstrated in molecular weight cutoff filters, implementation of these within a fluidic channel will directly advance the company?s understanding of the mechanisms of loss in sample preparation, provide a refined estimate of the cost savings that might be achieved in real world applications, and improve our understanding of transport for small molecules across these membranes.

    of a novel dosimeter for 2-D mapping of radiation dose in real-time at sub-millimeter
    spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution of the dosimeter is essential
    in supporting stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation
    therapy (SBRT) treatments. These rapidly emerging modalities deliver precise doses
    of radiation to small, well defined treatment sites while minimizing exposure
    of critical neighboring anatomy. With the annual number of SRS/SBRT treatments
    approaching 1,000,000 and growing 5-10% annually there is a market need for a
    dosimeter with sub-millimeter resolution and the capability of measuring in real-time.
    The routine pre-treatment verification of each patient therapy plan becomes a
    target application. The value of the market for the dosimeter alone exceeds $10
    million annually. The value is amplified through enablement of the safe and efficacious
    delivery of SRS and SBRT treatments.  Use of these modalities greatly impacts
    the efficiency of radiotherapy by substantially reducing the number of individual
    sessions in a course of treatment. The net result is lower cost for the treatment
    course, an increase in the number of patients/year for each linear accelerator
    equipment unit and a large reported improvement in patient outcomes.      \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project lies in combining and adapting key elements
    of two well-established commercial technologies, piezoelectric polymers and radiochromic
    film, to produce a hybrid dosimeter. This dosimeter preserves the high spatial
    resolution of radiochromic film while improving its usability by making the changes
    caused by radiation exposure to become detectable by electronic means in real-time.
    During use, the flexible, single-use piezoelectric array dosimeter (PARD) fits
    into a re-usable data acquisition electronics module that transmits a map of measured
    doses to a Medical Physicist outside the radiation cell. Radiochromic film, the
    only current dosimeter with sub-millimeter spatial resolution, is inconvenient
    owing to the long delay between exposure and measurement as well as the extra
    time and effort in facilitating the measurements. This drawback adversely impacts
    its usefulness in the day-to-day verification of patient treatment plans. The
    hybrid PARD product provides a dense, flexible array (0.1 mm spacing) of detectors
    with the unique ability for dose measurement at sub-millimeter resolution in real
    time. This overcomes key drawbacks of existing electronic array devices which
    are incapable of spatial resolution below 5 mm and unsuitable for the small radiation
    fields associated with SRs and SBRT treatments."

    The commercial potential of this project lies in enabling much needed high wireless data rates and equal quality of service (QoS) to both densely populated areas as well as remote rural areas. 4G cellular and WiFi networks are facing a bottleneck due to proliferation of wireless devices and limited spectrum available in the currently allocated bands for wireless communications. Improving data connectivity would require new physical fiber to be laid out which is becoming impractical due to high costs vs. return on investment. The Federal Communications Commission has opened more spectrum in the mm-wave frequency spectrum (between 28-70 GHz) for mobile users to alleviate some of these issues. This project will enable spectrally efficient communication through frequency reuse for spatially separated mobile users in the mm-wave frequencies. It will also allow low cost dense deployment of 5G cellular base-stations to boost QoS. With this new paradigms in human machine interaction using machine learning can be advanced further. Remote educational programs, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) based learning, online health care and other new services around Internet of Things will be enhanced by better wireless connectivity. These technologies will uplift people?s lives delivering major economic and broad societal impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a revolutionary architecture that will enable massive multi-user MIMO techniques for mm-wave wireless systems to solve the spectrum scarcity issue. The mm-wave radio front end module (FEM) can reuse the same frequencies for spatially diverse mobile users with active beamforming thus enhancing the capacity of current cellular networks by 100x. A multitude of modules (1000s) will be used in a large array as a part of the mm-wave FEM making it crucial to achieve excellent power efficiency at the module level. This project will investigate a variant of Doherty power amplifier (PA) architecture to achieve highly efficient mm-wave transmitter. Module to module variation and within module variations can disturb accurate beamforming capability. Impact of these variations on forming coherent beams will be studied. A new method to calibrate a large array to tune out any module to module variation will be proposed through sufficient redundancies incorporated in the module design. Low sensitivity to calibration errors will be achieved while also trying to lower the calibration time. A new algorithm that achieves accurate simultaneous tracking of spatial mobile users to within 5-degrees using the new architecture will be proposed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the management of clotting
    and bleeding which is a major clinical challenge that costs > $100B healthcare system burden. In
    the United States, it affects more than ten million patients of major surgery, trauma,
    cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancers. The underlying biology is a complex orchestration of
    protein and cellular pathways that react in the context of blood flow. Proven diagnostic tools that
    capture this complexity, and also meet the constraints of diverse challenges do not exist. This
    project intends to create a novel modular hemostasis test platform using proprietary microsystem
    modules deployed in configurable cartridges tailored to meet clinical requirements. Initially a
    3D microelectrode based platelet function test module will be developed and optimized with
    potential for best in class performance following multi-scale optimization of the dynamic,
    physical diagnostic environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a simple, low
    cost platelet function assay (PFA) with the objective of delivering best in class performance via
    multiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. Multiplate Electrode
    Aggregometry (MEA), a macroscale impedance-based device has already shown promise, yet
    remains cumbersome and has suboptimal classification accuracy between patient subsets. In
    MEA tests, as with most PFAs, the role of local fluid shear and macro/microscale physical
    environment remains largely neglected despite their well-recognized role in platelet response.
    Preliminary work suggests untapped potential in controlling and modifying PFA performance.
    By optimizing these signals with respect to clinical end points and subpopulation differentiation,
    this shear-based micro-platelet function test modules stand to revolutionize platelet function
    testing for the broadest possible benefits.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and validation of technologies that enable electric energy systems to operate reliably and affordably with very large amounts of renewable energy. Clean, reliable and affordable electricity is vital to modern society.  However the variability of wind and solar generation can lead to catastrophic grid reliability problems if real-time demand does not match the supply.  This project will develop and demonstrate a system to manage distributed (e.g., rooftop) solar photovoltaic systems operating with and without local electrical energy storage (i.e., batteries) in a way that extracts the most value for the customer, while simultaneously improving the reliability of the electricity infrastructure.  The project will leverage algorithms inspired by those used by millions of devices to send data over the Internet.  Like Internet data, energy will be delivered in discrete energy packets. These packets are coordinated independently, anonymously, and fairly to simultaneously solve real-world grid problems and provide value to end-users. The result of this project will be an integrated software-as-a-service and hardware solution in which customers gain incentives for participating and electricity industry members realize savings by reducing infrastructure needs, such as additional fossil fuel generation.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will enable the decentralized, randomized, and bottom-up coordination of two- and four-quadrant power-electronic inverters attached to solar photovoltaic and electric battery storage systems. In contrast to competing, centralized, top-down scheduling approaches, the proposed technology enables inverters to regulate both active and reactive power output according to an automaton that undergoes probabilistic state-transitions based on both real-time local measurements and communication with an aggregator. By incorporating local measurements, the method ensures that the energy needs of the end-use consumer are met while providing flexibility to a load aggregator or electric utility. This flexibility will enable distribution utilities to manage feeder power flows, losses, and voltage constraints. The probabilistic nature of the coordination prevents harmful synchronization effects, such as oscillations, while maintaining privacy of end-consumers through anonymous interactions akin to how data packets are routed on the Internet. Upon completion of the project, a commercially viable, human-friendly software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology will be demonstrated that implements this decentralized approach to coordinate distributed inverters in a manner that is compatible with modern grid operations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development, characterization, and commercialization of nonconductive, magnetically loaded, carbon fiber (CF) composite microwave absorbers. Manufacturers use absorbers to protect their products from unwanted Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations and standards. EMI from external and internal sources can degrade the operation and performance of electronics. The demand for EMI absorbing materials that are cost effective, lightweight, thin, flexible and wide-spectrum continues to grow rapidly as microwave communications and mobile technologies become ubiquitous. The overall EMI shielding market exceeded $5.4 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow to $7.8 billion in the next 5 years. Absorber materials developed in this project can be applied to almost any type of antenna, circuit board, cable, gasket or enclosure. The project goal and broader impacts of this technology are development of lightweight, thin, high performance, microwave absorber materials that provide increased energy efficiency, design flexibility, reduced costs and improved connectivity for a wide range of markets, applications, products and devices. The product is suitable for many market sectors including automotive, consumer electronics, telecom and aerospace where thin, lightweight and wide-spectrum response is needed.

    The intellectual merit of the project will be the creation of new CF composites for microwave absorption. This project will measure and define the fundamental electromagnetic absorption parameters of these composites in the 1 - 12 GHz range. Characterization data such as dielectric constants, complex electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, loss tangents and layer thickness of the absorbers will be measured and derived. Such parameterization is essential for simulation modeling and design optimization of such absorbers for various markets and applications. Absorber attenuation and frequency response will be simulated and validated with laboratory transmission line and reflectivity testing. These composites use both magnetic and dielectric mechanisms to absorb microwave energy. Composite CF absorber materials are nonconductive and rely on insertion loss and impedance matching and/or cavity resonance effects. Processes, techniques and equipment needed for commercial production will be investigated. Graduate students and faculty will be supported in development of test, measurement and modeling techniques. The execution of the project will demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of using CF composites as microwave absorbing materials and will provide a pathway to commercialization and product design. Successful completion of the project will create new high performance materials for the aerospace, automotive and consumer markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the efficient use of wireless
    spectrum. Over the last decade, the world has seen a sharp increase in the number and diversity
    of mobile devices. With this surge in mobile devices, access to spectrum has become an
    overarching issue impacting the everyday life of citizens. The demand is expected to grow
    exponentially in the coming years, with the rapid adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) linking
    everything we interact with in daily life. The technology developed under this project will allow
    communication devices to listen and broadcast simultaneously, on the same frequency, thus
    effectively doubling spectrum utilization by operating in Full Duplex (FD) mode. By improving
    spectral efficiency and simplifying frequency planning, the results from this project will enable
    newer paradigms for the rapid design, development and deployment of mobile devices. Society
    as a whole will benefit from the increased array of applications enabled by robust, spectrally
    efficient communication devices. Furthermore, valuable spectrum assets will be released and can
    be redirected to create new opportunities for growth.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a practical Full-duplex
    communication system prototype. The goal of the project is to develop a functional prototype
    showing the ability of fast cancellation that enables reliable full duplex operation at transmit
    powers suitable for outdoor deployment. While Full Duplex has been shown to be achievable
    under static channel conditions, maintaining the desired isolation between transmit and receive
    path in a dynamic channel is difficult, mainly due to the high level of reflected power into the
    radio system that can limit its performance. By deploying novel and efficient cancellation
    methodologies the prototype will be able to track and compensate for moving targets as they
    appear in the radiation space of the FD system. Innovative co-designed spatial, analog and digital
    approaches will be used to converge on the optimal parameters for cancellation, while ensuring
    a rapid response time. All proposed algorithms under this project will be tested on a real-time FD
    prototype system, under realistic wireless channel condition, to ensure that practical issues are
    accounted for.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a device for better, early screening of sepsis.  Sepsis costs the U.S. health care system over $24 billion every year, with as many as 3.1 million cases that claim over 300,000 lives annually. One out of every two to three hospitals deaths in the U.S. is due to sepsis. There are an estimated >19 million cases worldwide, and some reports have estimated that 1 person dies from sepsis every 4 seconds. Mortality rates due to severe sepsis are between 20% and 50%. The most urgent problem is a lack of accurate early screening methods. Survival rates drop by 7.6% per hour treatment is delayed. Current screening for sepsis utilizes the SIRS criteria, which include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and total WBC count. These parameters have very low specificity for early screening of sepsis. This project will replace these parameters with a panel of cell and protein biomarkers to provide highly specific and sensitive detection and stratification for sepsis. A hand-held point-of-care device and a one-time-use cartridge capable of providing total white blood count, lymphocyte, granulocyte/monocyte, and CD64 Neutrophils all from one drop of blood in a single cartridge will be developed. Such a system could save hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs every year in the United States.

    This project will develop a point of care sensor that can measure cell counts and proteins from a drop of blood. The technology combines the power of microfluidics, microfabrication, and on-chip electrically based cell and particle counting to develop a revolutionary new technology that combines electrical coulter counting with immuno-capture of cells and particles. The developed device would be the only one with the capability to offer in a single device the critical information of hematology analyzers, flow cytometers, protein, and DNA assays. This project enables the power of all of these tools to be harnessed from a single inherently simple, powerful, and scalable, platform. Such a device could dramatically increase both the frequency and the multiplexing of sampling of biomarkers from patient populations. In this proposal, commercial grade cartridges  will be used to develop protein measurements for procalcitonin, an FDA approved biomarker for sepsis, in addition to cell counting, from drop of blood of healthy and sick patients from hospital settings.

    The broader reaching impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project stems from the development and application of a new generation of cost-effective devices that can efficiently recover, preserve and quantify airborne microbes in near real time.  An improved ability to characterize the microbiology of indoor aerosols has a multitude of important engineering and public health benefits for urban society. This includes a vastly improved ability to monitor bioaerosols in health care settings; in water-damaged buildings; in plane/rail/bus transportation centers; as well as other high-density public venues.  Through this work, emerging aerosol technology will be optimized and deployed in portable instrumentation that reports what currently marketed aerosol monitoring equipment cannot provide: the identity, distribution and abundance of airborne microorganisms indoors.  This approach provides an unprecedented path to compile large exposure databases, which enable the scientific and medical community to better understand the potential effects of indoor microbial air pollution.  Compared to conventional aerosol sampling, these new filter-less devices require little human oversite, communicate aerosol data to cloud-based servers, and preserve bioaerosol samples with exceptional fidelity.  These next generation instruments provide an innovative, unobtrusive and practical method for surveying the indoor air we breathe every day, in near real-time.

    This STTR Phase I project integrates portable lasers for real-time microbe enumeration, with humidity controls that efficiently recover bacteria, fungi and pollen from indoor air. This advanced equipment assembly accurately counts, preserves and concentrates airborne microbes for stringent biochemical analysis that is relevant to public health.  The opportunity for this new instrumentation leverages the fundamental technological advantages it has over conventional sampling equipment, which until now predominantly relies on filtering large quantities of indoor air.   The mechanical stresses microbes must endure during conventional air filtration, seriously compromises the accuracy of airborne microbial analyses.  The research objective of this work is to challenge this novel instrumentation array with known quantities of airborne microbes that commonly inhabit the indoor environment.  Using widely accepted engineering and biochemistry methods, the overarching goal is to systematically validate the efficiency of this new equipment, both in the laboratory and in the field.  We anticipate markedly better quantitative recovery of airborne microbial activity and genetic material (DNA) where directly compared to its filter-based counterparts.  Thus, the commercial and societal value of this new instrumentation is realized through displacing outmoded aerosol collection methods with highly efficient filter-less air sampling devices, outfitted with modern optics and digital automation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to create a personalized, precision-based practice paradigm for surgery that improves surgical outcomes and reduces the cost of healthcare. This paradigm utilizes individual patient characteristics with machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict the risk of post-surgical complications. Additionally, it offers the possibility of enacting impactful interventions among high-risk patients, while reducing unnecessary therapies among low-risk patients, thereby improving surgical outcomes, maximizing the efficiency of healthcare, and minimizing cost. In a value-based care model, this paradigm aligns the goals of health systems, surgeons, and patients.

    The proposed project combines individual patient data with machine-learning algorithms to effectively predict surgical complication risk and improve surgical clinical outcomes. Currently, 13% of 50 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually result in a surgical complication, half which are potentially avoidable. A primary cause of avoidable complications include significant variable in risk assessment and standardized preventative practice. Therefore, the principal objective of this proposal is to develop machine-learning predictive models of various surgical complications (wound, cardiac, respiratory, renal, etc.), which provides an objective risk assessment for surgeons. Additionally, this risk assessment platform will allow stratification of patients into high- vs. low-risk categories and link patients with risk-appropriate preventative interventions at the point-of-care.

    to develop an advanced non-contact, non-destructive monitoring technology to reliably
    identify early fatigue damage in pipelines, piping, and tubing. Current industry
    practice relies on statistically based, semi-empirical models that unfortunately
    can have an order of magnitude in error in predicting fatigue life, a leading
    failure mode in metals that are exposed to high cycling, high strain, and/or elevated

    of miles of pipes, pipelines, and tubing that are critical in the transport of
    valuable fluids serving a number of industries including municipal water, production
    and transport of oil and gas, and chemicals in processing plants. Unfortunately,
    this aging infrastructure can fail with disastrous consequences. \nThe successful
    development and commercialization of this new technology will be a great leap
    in integrity monitoring, resulting in significant reduction in costs and delays,
    and eliminating catastrophic failures in the field. The estimated total addressable
    market for pipeline and coil tubing monitoring are in excess of $4 billion annually.\n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this SBIR project centers on the demonstration of the technical
    and economic feasibility of this novel fatigue monitoring technology with a specific
    target of identifying when the material has reached 90% of its actual fatigue
    life. The technology is based on a novel electromagnetic measurement scheme that
    can effectively detect magnetic dislocations in the material which have been shown
    to be early indicators of failure due to fatigue. Using advanced analytics, strong
    correlations between the measured electromagnetic properties and fatigue life
    can provide a direct and reliable identifier of imminent fatigue damage without
    loss of material integrity. The major challenges that this SBIR effort proposes
    to address are (1) engineering an electromagnetic-based measurement technique
    with sufficient sensitivity to detect the magnetic defects seen in early fatigue
    damage under field operating conditions (2) developing appropriate detection algorithms
    to handle the statistical variations affecting fatigue damage and (3) engineering
    a cost-effective monitoring solutions compared with alternative fatigue management

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to reduce the necessary supervision and oversight required to operate multiple unmanned platforms in the execution of real-world, specific, task-based activities supporting search and rescue, routine mapping and intelligence gathering missions.  Shifting control from teleoperation to autonomous navigation could enable first responders such as lifeguards, to quadruple their capacity to assist in mass, maritime disaster, rescue scenarios for example. The current practice of a single lifeguard handling 3 victims in a routine riptide incident will be improved by a factor of four, through the use of this technology, allowing lifeguards to better manage mass-scale, maritime disasters that may involve a hundred victims. Human lifeguards could focus on those people requiring immediate personal assistance (unconscious, hypothermia or children for instance), while unmanned maritime platforms could be tasked with responding to clusters of survivors better capable of self-rescue.  Lifeguard assistant robots can also help with the over 400,000 lower profile events in the US each year.  A robot could not only save lives but reduce risk to the lifeguard who typically has to swim or jet-ski out to provide flotation and rescue lines to victims in dangerous conditions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop increased intelligence and self-awareness for autonomous platforms that will result in an increase in operator ?trust? and allow potential operators who might consider autonomous platforms as ?unreliable? due to potential lost communication links, to have greater confidence in adopting these platforms.  The technology will transition from far field navigation control (such as waypoint based navigation) to a near field control allowing precision delivery of the platform to the desired location in a dynamic environment.  This capability would allow a maritime platform to autonomously drive to a designated cluster of survivors, slow down and behave according to known social proxemics so as not to further stress the victims.  On board, vehicle health monitoring would allow critical system parameters to be reported and broadcast allowing ad-hoc networking with other platforms in the region.  The overall objective would be to optimize the use of resources in any region and to quickly allow multiple lifeguard teams converging on a mass marine casualty event to interact but without having to pre-register or have a priori knowledge of each other?s systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the impact of precision medicine by simultaneously addressing large-scale medical data aggregation and optimized computation that is cost-effective and to extend the utility of medical informatics well beyond current practice. Patient medical information comes in many diverse forms: genomic sequences, medical images, and clinical observations. The integration of these various data sources across patient populations have shown to reveal patterns and similarities among patients, which inform treatment options. With advances in imaging and genomic sequencing technologies, the sheer volume of available information is growing exponentially, straining current computational approaches, and creating an imminent need for scalable data integration. The ability to overcome this data mountain opens the door to support advanced analytics to support precision medicine and provide enhanced services to medical institutions. With these innovations, patients receive faster and more accurate diagnoses and treatments, clinicians deliver verified treatment decisions through patient cohort comparison, hospitals have better standard of care, and society is overall empowered by supporting global treatment options and well informed pharmaceutical development.

    The proposed project will develop a scalable aggregation and analysis framework to integrate various patient data modalities to inform personalized diagnosis and therapy in precision medicine. Currently, information from different modalities exists in silos, hindering joint analysis and insight. While there has been research trying to leverage machine learning techniques in medical imaging, these efforts have generally focused on a single domain and not been able to integrate facts from other domains. This project will aggregate features from genomics, imaging and clinical characterization of patients into scalable databases and then use a distributed, parallel framework to enable efficient analytics on the resultant joint representation. The resulting platform will enable identification of cohorts based on both genotypes and phenotypes and empower powerful machine learning analyses to inform clinical decision systems or identification of new personalized therapies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit nearly 6 million children per year who are suspected of having abnormal Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) which can lead to a more serious condition with numerous complications referred to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Current detection paradigms include costly and invasive procedures that often require overnight hospitalization, prescribing pharmacological Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) without objective evidence and or exposure to radiological imaging.  The outcomes of this project will lead to a low cost, non-invasive method for detecting GER, without requiring hospitalization.  This will facilitate earlier detection of GER and reduce overall healthcare costs and burdens associated with GERD and its accompanying complications.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using single point ultrasonic transducers to non-invasively detect and characterize reflux.  Current reflux detection relies on impedance and pH probes which are placed in the patient?s esophagus through a nasogastric probe.  This often requires anesthesia and overnight hospital observation which is costly, invasive, and prone to artifacts that change the reflux episodes normally experienced by the patient.  Ultrasonic imaging can observe reflux occurring in the esophagus but requires hundreds of ultrasonic transducers in a single probe and a trained clinician to manually observe and identify the reflux events.  These two factors make ultrasonic imaging costly to use and prevents it from being used for extended periods of time, which is necessary to determine if abnormal amounts of reflux are occurring.  The proposed project will use ultrasonic imaging as a control method to demonstrate the ability of single point ultrasonic transducers to generate an acoustic signature capable of detecting whether the esophagus is expanded or collapsed to identify episodes of reflux.  Detection and characterization of reflux through single point transducers would ultimately enable the development of a portable, safe, and accurate home monitoring device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to standardize the process of securing and protecting umbilical cord catheters. These catheters are inserted into newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are used to provide life-saving nutrients and medication directly into their bloodstream. Unfortunately, the infection rate associated with these catheters is among the highest in the healthcare system. There is an important need for a simple medical device that reduces the risk of infection. A reduction in infection rate would save hospitals hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they must currently absorb the cost of treating these infections. Most importantly, reducing umbilical catheter infection rates would save neonatal lives in any hospital setting.

    The proposed project will develop a standardized device that reliably secures umbilical cord catheters and protects the catheter insertion site from various sources of infection. The current standard of care for securing these catheters in NICUs across the United States is a roll of non-sterile tape that offers no protective barrier to the catheter insertion site. This is in stark contrast to medical devices that are used with adult catheters and help prevent bloodstream infections. The research objectives include evaluating different materials, testing the catheter securement mechanism, testing bacterial colonization rates, and evaluating the device?s biosafety for use on neonatal skin. This will be accomplished using custom-built testing rigs and protocols. We anticipate the successful development of a device with material specifications that allow for clinical testing in the NICU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering and enhance the workflow efficiency in physically-based rendering. This can impact a broad range of industries, including video games, product visualization, animation, visual effects, scientific rendering and virtual/augmented reality. The superior performance and greatly reduced cost will allow the same system to be used in the manufacturing industry, which requires high-resolution depth measurement. This technology will result in the broader adoption of non-contact 3D metrology and 3D machine vision for manufacturing quality control and defect inspection.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot decouple the direct reflection and sub-surface scattering. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance and greatly reduced cost.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help establish a commercially viable method for mass production of high-efficiency heat exchangers for the rapid advancement of thermoelectric solar cells and waste heat management. The advancement to be made in this project will help harvest an enormous amount of solar energy and heat energy from the environment. Thermal energy from natural (solar, geothermal etc.) as well as from man-made thermal sources is a continuously available, and currently underutilized resource with the potential to become an important pillar of renewable energy. The solar thermoelectric devices require minimal maintenance and are suitable for deployment in remote regions. The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the performance of solar thermoelectric generators. Besides harnessing solar energy, thermoelectric devices can also be used for waste heat recovery from automobile exhaust and industries using high-temperature furnaces to enhance fuel efficiency and generate electricity for automotive operations. Our estimated outcome can enhance the fuel efficiency of automobile engines by 15-20 %with around $67 billion annual reductions in gasoline expenses and around 570 billion pound reduction in annual carbon emission.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a disruptive technology to improve the efficiency of thermoelectric devices. Currently, the efficiency of thermoelectric devices is much lower than their theoretical values due to the lack of ideal heat exchanger materials for both hot and cold ends. The research goal is to enhance current module efficiency by more than 90%. The project includes testing and validation of the heat exchanger into thermoelectric generation modules for solar electricity generation and waste heat management from thermal sources at different temperatures, as well as developing methods for mass production of heat exchanger materials. The size of the treated surfaces can be well controlled, making it possible to fabricate microscale solar thermal devices for infrared sensors and night vision cameras.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to engineer brewer's yeast for a more consistent, cost-effective,
    and sustainable brewing process. The flowers of hop plants provide both bitterness
    and \"hoppy\" flavor to beer. Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive
    crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it expensive and difficult
    to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.  The goal is to engineer brewer's
    yeast to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor
    to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil.
    Over the last two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for
    beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries
    to source (total domestic hop sales have tripled over the last 10 years due to
    heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources:
    ~100 trillion liters of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops.
    Reducing the reliance of the brewing industry on hops would significantly increase
    the sustainability of the brewing process by decreasing water usage, also leading
    to the commercial benefits of decreased brewing costs and greater consistency
    of beer flavor.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer the biosynthesis
    of hop-derived monoterpenes in brewer's yeast to meet the following industrial
    performance requirements: 1) Normal propagation and fermentation characteristics,
    2) precise and robust production of monoterpenes at scale, and 3) the absence
    of off-flavors. The proposed research sets out to test whether the expression
    of 5 key biosynthesis pathway enzymes can be expressed in a way that each of these
    performance requirements is met in a single strain.  Recently developed synthetic
    biology tools will be used to create hundreds of DNA constructs, each containing
    a different combination of promoters driving expression of the 4 corresponding
    genes (designs).  Incorporating genetically stable DNA constructs into brewer's
    yeast is complicated by their polyploid genome. To overcome this difficulty, preliminary
    work was conducted to develop a Cas9-mediated integration strategy, which leverages
    a colorometric assay to assist with the challenge of identifying stable pathway
    transformants.  Strains will be constructed and evaluated in two subsequent rounds.
    \ In the first round, a diverse set of designs will be explored, and in a second
    round, strains will be constructed based on the designs that most closely meet
    with performance requirements and avoid production of potential off-flavors."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable doctors to maximize the diagnostic information extracted from costly Pediatric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Annually, approximately 3.5 million brain MRI scans are performed with average prices with interpretation from $500 - $2,000. Even though the scans are expensive to acquire and interpret, doctors generally only use visual inspection of the images to diagnose abnormalities. The proposed software will be relatively cheap compared to the overall cost of an MRI and is expected to let doctors make accurate measurements of key structures in the brain. This is important because developmental and other diseases can cause small volume and surface area changes that cannot be easily seen by the human eye. By detecting these changes early, doctors should be able to treat the disease at early stages, potentially leading to better quality of life and financial savings. The proposed tool is also expected to enable doctors to better track treatment outcomes, by measuring the effect a drug or treatment has on particular structures in the brain. Ultimately, it is expected that the proposed technology will improve quality of care as well as reduce healthcare costs.

    The proposed project leverages current advances in computational technology such as machine learning and computer vision to automatically measure volume, surface area and shapes in critical parts of the brain in children. These measurements are then compared to a large database of children over the ages of 0-12 years to determine if they have deviated from normal. Although MRIs have been increasing adopted as the diagnostic tool of choice for childhood brain disorders due to the lack of radiation, there has yet to be a tool that allows doctors to accurately measure changes in a child's brain from MRI scans. Because, in children, the brain is rapidly changing as she/he grows, it is difficult to determine visually whether the changes are due to normal development or disease. By measuring the brain accurately and comparing it to a large database already collected by the proposing team, it is expected that a pediatric doctor will be able to determine whether a child's brain has deviated from normal. It could also allow physicians to better select treatments and monitor the patient response to a specific therapy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a new disruptive approach to enable the digital transformation of US industrial infrastructure through extreme low latency, highly reliable and secure wireless networks. The proposal aligns closely with U.S. government programs such as Manufacturing USA and the National Robotics Initiative. The World Economic Forum reported recently that manufacturing has been immensely important to the prosperity of nations. This has never been more true than right now as countries compete to make huge investments in the digital transformation process of their manufacturing firms. The innovation provides significant advancement that is expected to boost U.S. worker productivity, advance wireless innovation and increase cost savings and business agility. The Industrial Internet of Things drives new investment in automated factories, industrial digital networks and integration with real-time edge computing. Data expansion at the edge of today's networks are new challenges for industrial firms that seek to deploy flexible and economically viable digital infrastructure. The company provides an innovative solution that enables wireless edge computing. Instead of expensive and inflexible wired networks, this new technology unlocks the full potential of wireless sensor networks for automation and control systems. 

    The proposed project will demonstrate the company's concept of ultra-secure, highly reliable, time-sensitive/synchronized wireless protocol for Industrial IoT markets. The novel system design is a general purpose, extremely low latency, wireless communications link that supports real-time connection to industrial devices. The company's technology operates chaos-based spread spectrum communications links, functional chaos-based IIoT sub-nets with anticipated scalability of a plurality of sub-nets operating within unlicensed bands. Enabling an extreme precision time synchronization is critical to industrial systems and network applications in time-sensitive edge computing networks. To date, standard access technologies such as Ethernet are not deterministic and clock synchronization protocols are fundamentally limited by the characteristics of packet switching or efficient access to reliable clocks. In particular, legacy network's jitter, packet buffering and scheduling in switches and network stack overheads add non-deterministic variances to the round trip time, which must be accurately measured to synchronize clocks. This proposal is for a wireless-based synchronization technology that uses more granular timing mechanisms to achieve nanosecond precision. The company introduces a clock synchronization protocol that uses wireless chaotic waveforms that connects to network devices for decentralized clock synchronization. This eliminates the need for wires and non-deterministic elements in clock synchronization protocols.

    This STTR Phase I project will enable the rapid prototyping and manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) components with 3D printing, and thereby reduce component cost, weight, and turnaround time. The global RF components market is expected to reach $17.54 billion by 2022, but fabrication techniques for commercial RF components have seen little innovation. Conventional RF manufacturing techniques, such machining and photolithography, are accurate and reliable, but they are also expensive, time-consuming and produce unnecessary waste. 3D printing enables fast and accurate manufacturing of custom components, as well as the creation of extremely complex geometries at low-cost for improved component performance. 3D printing can also enable users to design components to fit the design space available, removing the necessity of designing technology around commercially available parts, a critical feature in space and weight-sensitive aerospace applications. However, the materials available to 3D printing are mostly limited to non-conducting polymers. By creating a highly conductive 3D printing material, and testing the properties of RF components made with this filament, this project will make it possible to rapidly prototype and produce custom RF components, thereby accelerating research and improving the competitiveness of RF component manufacturing in the U.S.

    This STTR proposal will create a highly conductive (>2×10^5 S m-1) polymer filament that can be used with low-cost fused deposition modeling 3D printers to create a variety of high-value RF components. The filament will be engineered to print reliably, and retain its conductivity and mechanical integrity to temperatures of ~150 °C. To achieve these goals, the proposed work will determine the relationship between conductivity, the loading of conductive filler, the shape of the conductive filler, the filament mechanical properties, and the viscosity of the filament at printing temperatures. New methods will be developed to prevent oxidation of the conductive filler at elevated temperatures. A novel conductive filler will be developed to achieve these performance specifications at low cost. Concurrent with these material development efforts, novel RF components will be designed, simulated, and printed in order to build a comprehensive database with detailed designs and printing parameters for producing the RF components with a low failure rate. By the end of this project, users will be able to design, predict, and reliably print RF components with conductive filament on low-cost 3D printers.

    This SBIR Phase I project uses artificial intelligence techniques to identify the ways that undergraduate students in scientific courses explicate problems, describe procedures, make claims, provide evidence, offer qualifications, and draw conclusions. With emphasis on forms of scientific reasoning, this new use of artificial intelligence, to identify language patterns associated with scientific reasoning, will allow students to improve their written laboratory reports before they are submitted, therefore freeing instructors to devote precious instructional time to preparing students for roles as practicing scientists. As the U.S. continues to experience rapid diversity growth, this focus on helping students through innovative uses of technology holds the potential to expand science education by cultivating student ability through autonomous writing and revision. Because artificial intelligence techniques are intended to expand capabilities, the techniques being used, available 24/4 on the web, will have the direct impact of growing our technical and scientific workforce, thus expanding the many dynamic pathways to STEM occupations. As the NSF observed in 2015 in its report Revisiting the STEM Workforce, these jobs are extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness and are essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness. An investment in such a technology is thus an investment in national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and workforce diversity.

    NSF SBIR support will be used to design and launch artificial intelligence techniques based on Deep Artificial Neural Network (DANN) as driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the latest advances in AI algorithms. Because NLP and LSA techniques are presently used solely to identify grammatical and organizational patterns, the application of DANN is high risk in making a leap from identifying patterns of language use to capturing patterns of scientific reasoning. Trained on a proprietary corpus of 100,000 lab reports scored and annotated by instructors and students using a single rubric, the AI application will identify logic structures of scientific reasoning in student laboratory reports. Once methodically identified, categorized according to ability level, and validated by STEM instructors, digital instruction will be used to help students improve their scientific reasoning processes. With the singular goal of structuring student success through asynchronous machine learning, this innovation holds the promise to figure meaningfully in discussions of national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and diversity as related to STEM education.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of the Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a bioreactor that may be used for production and expansion of cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery.  While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

  title: 'STTR Phase I:  Novel Wicking Matrix Bioreactor for Pluripotent and Progenitor
    Cell Expansion'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an engineered nonmodel yeast platform for
    the economical and sustainable production of natural aroma compounds. High quality
    aroma compounds have a variety of applications, ranging from flavor and fragrance
    to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. With the strong consumer demand for more natural
    alternatives to chemically synthesized ingredients in both food and personal care
    items, the production of these ingredients by fermentation will add a renewable
    source to the supply chain and will reduce demand on botanical sources. This work
    will advance methodologies and knowledge for creating novel microbial cell factories
    via 13C-metabolite tracing, metabolic flux analysis, fermentation optimization,
    and kinetic modeling. The lessons from this research will offer general guidelines
    for overcoming biosynthesis hurdles and optimizing bioprocess operations, and
    will facilitate the development of transferable technologies for inexpensive production
    of diverse natural products that are broadly used for human health and wellness.
    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural
    aroma compounds. Because plants carry aroma compounds in extremely low amounts,
    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these
    challenges, this project will develop a novel fermentation process for production
    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.
    Ultimately, this environmentally friendly process would provide a new, reliable
    and natural manufacture scheme to meet the growing demand of consumers for healthier
    products."

    This SBIR Phase I project will research the feasibility of applying virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in manufacturing and material testing training programs to increase academic achievement, accelerate progress toward degree and foster more effective use of expensive lab-equipment.  According to 2014 statistics, in the United States, less than 40% of students entering college in STEM fields finish with a STEM degree. And even for those who finish, a majority (over 60% ) take several years longer than the nominal time of 4 years. Providing students with VR and AR enabled personalized manufacturing labs is a promising way to increase students' engagement and better prepare them for future careers as well as broaden students' outlook on innovation. As described in the recent US council report on competitiveness, advanced manufacturing has the largest multiplier effect on jobs. In order for the US to gain competitiveness in this sector, there is a pressing need for a trained workforce that is able to develop new materials testing protocols and manufacturing processes. This SBIR project aims to develop technologies that enable the education sector to leverage VR and AR to accelerate training. Proposed software will be evaluated through pilot testing. Technology and insights resulting from this project may find applications in other domains such as life sciences.


    Key technical innovations in this proposed research include the development of a novel high-fidelity modular virtual object model, customized task models based on evidence centered design, and methods to flexibly combine object models with task models to rapidly develop activities suitable for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. These innovations may significantly reduce the content creation cost and potentially dissolve the boundary between classroom education and hands-on training, providing an effective and seamless educational experience. In the long term, these innovations may also be applied broadly to training in other domains. The overarching goal of this SBIR project is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system for content creation and learning analytics and apply them to create innovative content for use in manufacturing courses. The proposed system and content will be evaluated via pilot testing with engineering students to collect rich datasets comprising videos, sensor time series data and simulation-event logs. Data analysis will seek evidence for changes in both students outcomes (changes in content knowledge, engagement, attitude towards engineering, self-efficacy towards learning engineering, usability of the product) and instructor outcomes (attitudes about the usefulness of the product).

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor
    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,
    and to implement on-chip blood plasma separation for PT/INR measurements."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of an instrument to address the
    scaling and regulatory challenges of quality control that increase cost and impede
    large scale deployment of cellular therapies to a wide patient base. Cellular
    therapies taking advantage of engineered human cells have shown incredible potential
    as \"living drugs\" that achieve personalized therapies for cancer patients. Recent
    improvements in these therapies have shown their efficacy in targeting and killing
    specific types of leukemias. In light of these successes, more and more research
    and clinical trials are being proposed to improve current efficacy in treating
    blood cancers and adapting these therapies to other cancers types. While showing
    promise in the fight against cancer, there is growing concern over the manufacturability
    of clinical doses, especially when scaling up to meet global demands. Additionally,
    the speed at which these therapies are being developed is causing regulatory agencies
    to lag behind in terms of quality control and release criteria. Both of these
    issues will need to be addressed as cellular therapies continue to improve and
    increase in demand. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated
    quality control instrument for the manufacture of cellular therapies, which centers
    around a disruptive new technology called ratcheting cytometry. Currently, quality
    control of therapeutic cell batches remains difficult to standardize and scale
    given the plethora of standalone tools needed to adequately characterize each
    batch. This modular approach has high capital cost, high recurring maintenance
    costs, and requires skilled technicians. Ideally, the capabilities of these standalone
    tools can be combined into one automated system to provide standardized metrics
    for cellular therapy quality without user variability. Leveraging well-established
    immunomagnetic cell labeling techniques, ratcheting cytometry is able combine
    the capabilities of quality control tools by individually measuring magnetic content
    and gating based on surface expression. Leveraging these advantages, the goal
    is to demonstrate feasibility for an integrated instrument to quantify cell number,
    viability, surface expression, and cytokine secretion of therapeutic cell batches
    in a single step assay."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will enable
    the recycling of valuable materials from complex wastes that today cannot be recovered.
    The commercial impact from this innovation is to allow for complex waste streams
    that contain multiple materials, such as carpets and textiles, to serve as the
    source of raw materials for the manufacture of new goods in a way that is cost
    advantaged. This gives those businesses that use such raw materials a sustainable
    alternative and, a lower-cost, efficiently produced material. In this way, there
    will be significant incentive for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that
    today either goes to landfills, oceans, or is incinerated for energy- a very low
    value application. The project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling
    of complex, multi-component materials.    \n\nThis project will develop novel
    technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such as
    carpets and textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today,
    there does not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are
    in these wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using
    chemical techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling, to enable the value-added
    recycling of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development
    will take place in order to take the current status of the technology to a status
    that is ready for implementation in a pilot plant. The main technical objective
    is to develop the process for production of consistent, high purity product. Materials
    such as polyester and nylon currently cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic
    fibers such as cotton or even heavily cross-linked rubbers as those that are found
    in carpet. The goals of the research are to develop the proposers' current process
    for fractionating the nylons and polyesters with an emphasis on achieving high
    purity products for reuse. To this end, various solution processing techniques
    will be investigated for exclusion of impurities from end product polymer."

    This project entails the build out of the simulation engine for a touch-based, mobile game designed to intuitively teach the basics of electricity and magnetism to children aged 5+.  The mobile game gives users a picture of what?s happening inside a circuit, and allows them to play with the charges, electric and magnetic forces, voltage, capacitors, transistors, etc.  The use of funds from this NSF SBIR Grant would include the research and development required to build and incorporate this simulator into the game.  This simulator is novel, is customized for educational use, must be extraordinarily fast, and is based on Maxwell?s Equations, the four equations that govern all of electricity and magnetism.  The successful completion of this project will create a new way of teaching electricity and magnetism to children, giving them a visual understanding of the concepts.  The goal is to make science and engineering more attainable subjects to pursue in higher education.  This will lead to an increase in the number of science and engineering graduates in the US, and help to close the international educational achievement gap, which experts agree represents over a $1T overall opportunity loss.  Besides having a profound effect on the US economy, this also benefits the individual.  In 2014, the DOE reported that the median starting income of a STEM (engineering) graduate was $74,000, almost $25,000 more than a non-STEM graduate.

    The proposed real-time, interactive, multi-touch-based simulator would be the first of its kind; no combined two-dimensional field and circuit simulator exists today, particularly for use in an educational game.  This combined simulator only has 16 milliseconds to update its results, whereas a typical two-dimensional field solver could take minutes to hours to solve.  By using a novel simulator architecture and by focusing on speed and conceptual understanding at the necessary precision, the game simulator will be able to achieve the over 100x speed-up required.  The simulator needs to solve Maxwell?s equations and thus calculate and display the electromagnetic physics behavior at 60 frames per second, the rate required for interactive gaming. Several approaches are used to accomplish this.  This simulator is built from the ground up, with a unique choice of variables that prioritizes qualitative understanding over the circuit size and accuracy requirements of an industrial simulator.  The simulator focuses on components and circuits commonly used in teaching.  The simulator also utilizes the combined central/graphics processing hardware available in modern mobile devices.  With this simulator as the core gaming engine, the company is building a game where children as young as five can experiment with and intuitively understand the basics of electricity, magnetism, and circuits.

- abstractText: "The broad impact of the proposed SBIR project is in the development
    of Graphene oxide based filtration membranes in industrial applications, such
    as pharmaceutical and chemical production.  Current polymer membranes are not
    meeting specific industrial needs and are unlikely to do so with incremental innovation.
    On the other hand, converting from distillation and evaporation to membrane-based
    separation has the potential to reduce energy consumption in the US by 10%.  The
    proposed graphene oxide based material is a robust nanomaterial that is capable
    of separating streams at the molecular level  while withstanding the challenging
    environments of chemical separations. Successful implementation will increase
    process intensification and energy efficiency for pharmaceutical and chemical
    producers, while simultaneously enabling previously inaccessible separations.
    \ \n  \nGraphene Oxide (GO) membranes enable a new materials platform for fine
    liquid filtration in harsh environments. These temperature stable, solvent resistant,
    and oxidizer tolerant membranes will accomplish nanofiltration (NF) separation
    of a range of feed streams. With immediate benefits in reducing cleaning time
    and downtime for dairy and food production and high impact for energy savings
    in pharmaceutical and chemical separations, materials innovation for membranes
    represents a large opportunity for energy and cost savings. GO is synthesized
    at near ambient temperatures with low-cost synthetic chemistry methods and thus
    is many orders of magnitude less expensive than graphene.  This proposal focuses
    on further developing the graphene oxide material for the high value pharmaceutical
    and chemical streams in order to transition from heat-based or low-throughput
    distillation, evaporation, and chromatography methods towards the significantly
    lower cost and energy-efficient membrane alternative."

    This project researches and develops a novel mathematics communication and collaboration system. Mathematics is the foundation of Science and Technology, and national competence in the STEM fields is essential to maintaining our competitive edge on a global scale. Math literacy hinges on effective communication of mathematical concepts and processes. However, despite significant advances in pedagogical methods, the way we communicate mathematics remains curiously behind the times. Preliminary customer and market research has revealed that the lack of adequate communication tools for mathematical and technical expressions is holding back the advance of mathematics in online environments such as online tutoring. Moreover, the scarcity of effective communication tools has reinforced the long-standing preconception that math is primarily a solitary activity, and it has created an unintended and harmful selection bias restricting the diversity of students entering STEM fields. This project fills the void of adequate math communications tools with an dynamic, interactive system for communicating mathematical derivations in real-time in an online environment. The system facilitates student-student and student-teacher remote communication of mathematics, and it is particularly suited for student-tutor communication on online tutoring platforms.

    The math communication and collaboration system this project develops leverages the company's proprietary equation manipulation technology. This system employs an integrated math engine and a touch-based interface allowing users to manipulate equations using simple drag-and-drop gestures. It is built on a game-engine allowing for multi-player support. This project integrates the equation manipulation technology into a networked multi-user interface to connect one or more users for real-time communication of mathematical derivations. The project researches the precise needs of students, teachers, and online tutors to tailor the user interface to the specific needs of online mathematics communication. Specific problems the project researches include multi-player networking and matchmaking functionality, optimal network architecture for the system, transfer of control between users for effective communication, integration of traditional communication tools within the system, and reduction of latency time to enhance real-time interactivity. Successful completion of the project will result in a first-of-its-kind math communication system that allows users in different places to connect online and communicate a mathematical derivation as it is happening, and as easily as if they were in the same room. The primary project deliverable is a minimum viable product to be piloted and vetted through the company?s existing math app.
