    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to them. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two key research objectives: scaling the technology to work for teams of size 10,000+, and determining the feasibility of porting the technology to mobile. A major scalability research area is search. The company envisions the technology to be the primary place where decisions are made, and hence a primary place where knowledge is stored, so fast, full-text search is important, despite the fact that chat generates much more traffic than email. One research area on mobile is the HCI challenge of displaying rich options for conversation navigation on a small mobile screen. The problem is unique to this technology, since having long running, asynchronous conversations means that users do not typically read messages in a strictly chronological fashion. The company anticipates the Phase I grant will enable it to develop a working solution to the search scalability problem, and a working prototype of a performant and productive mobile user experience.

    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture
    allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly
    to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced
    image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning
    accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal
    growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts
    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast
    phantom."

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.

    The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel set of materials for additive manufacturing technologies.  Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $5bn industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture new and innovative products.  It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing economy.  Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion of the available material library.  3D printing materials are limited to a small segment of the plastics in common industrial use today.  This project will expand that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with a broad range of flexibilities.  These materials will be particularly relevant for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear.  Manufacturers of flexible, durable polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance that match their product specifications.  The printing system will enable production of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material printing for novel product designs.


    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range.  The materials will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle liquid, reactive feeds.  The research approach will include determination of the starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.  Reaction kinetics control will be critical to develop a robust printing process and to overcome issues with print-direction strength that are common in extrusion printing processes. Raw material reactivity, catalyst selection, and relative concentrations of formulation components will be key experimental parameters.  Accessing a range of flexibility will require building formulas with varied molecular weights, and these formula variations will be balanced with resin printability.   This 3D printing technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a biofungicide for application
    on organic farms as well as conventional farms and home and lawn care as an alternative
    to chemical fungicides. More than 70% of all major crop diseases are caused by
    fungi. Despite intensive disease control practices, these pathogens are still
    causing crop losses averaging 13% with economic losses up to $100 billion annually.
    The proposed research will address the need for sustainable food production by
    development of methods/technologies to reduce or eliminate the usage of chemical
    pesticides. It will reduce the impact of plant pathogens, insect pests, and abiotic
    stresses on crop plants by inducing systemic resistance in crops. Unlike chemical
    fungicides, it will be eco-friendly and will prevent development of anti-fungal
    resistance in plant pathogens. Furthermore, reduction in chemical fungicide usage
    (produced using fossil fuels) will reduce US dependence on fossil fuels and promote
    environmental sustainability. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    a novel, broad spectrum, biofungicide for crop protection as an alternative to
    chemical fungicides. The novel broad spectrum fungicide is based on a fermentative
    strategy utilizing non-pathogenic microorganisms and low-cost carbon substrates.
    Antifungal activity testing in in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated broad
    spectrum fungicidal activity against multiple fungal pathogens that cause diseases
    in cereals, fruit, and vegetable crops. The use of chemical fungicides produced
    from fossil fuels has been shown to have adverse environmental effects on non-target
    organisms, and mammals. In addition, combinations of chemical fungicides are required
    to attain crop protection, yet fungal pathogens quickly become resistant to chemical
    fungicides. The proposed broad spectrum biofungicide has no mammalian toxicity,
    and has been shown to be safe for non-target anthropods like honey bees. It also
    has been shown to not inhibit the growth of beneficial fungi. As part of the Phase
    I research plan, the aims are to scale up production and test the biofungicide
    under development in small plot trials."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to significantly improve the patient experience by providing easy, convenient, and fast delivery of protein therapeutics through the administration of high-concentration, low-viscosity solutions via subcutaneous injection. Currently, high-concentration antibody solutions have viscosities far above the recommended limit for subcutaneous injections. This project aims to drastically lower the viscosities of high-concentration protein formulations. The success of this project would greatly benefit patients by providing a much shorter administration time for drugs that now require hours of intravenous infusion. In addition, this solution can also improve therapies that are already administered subcutaneously by reducing the frequency of injections by increasing dosage. Development of this technology can also enable the development of protein therapeutics with promising efficacy, but intractable solution properties or commercially unattractive patent lives.

    The goal of this Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept data supporting the viability of a new formulation platform for proteins. This platform will generate a formulation containing high concentrations of protein therapeutics which may be delivered at substantially lowered viscosities due to a reduction in the intermolecular interactions among proteins. The formulation thus provides a subcutaneous syringe-compatible route to delivering biologics at high-concentration, and low-viscosity, ultimately driving a shift from timely intravenous delivery protocols to simplified subcutaneous injections. Constraints on subcutaneous delivery volume (<2 mL) necessitate antibody concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL. Unfortunately, viscosities far beyond the accepted injection limit (50 cP) are typical of this situation due to extensive interaction among the protein molecules. Current viscosity reduction methods attempt to regulate these interactions but have yet to substantially address the issue. The proposed work utilizes a novel process to gently formulate proteins using only FDA-approved materials. This approach eliminates the effect of the protein-protein interactions on the solution viscosity. The proposed project will involve development of the platform through (i) identification of optimal formulation parameters, (ii) demonstration of rheological improvements to high-concentration protein solutions, and (iii) demonstration of preservation of biological structure and activity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require more modeling to be codified and bring more stakeholders into the fold. Organizations need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that are capable of handling this wider range of data, are fully accessible to non-technical users, and allow more stakeholders to participate in this important process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. On one end, spreadsheets serve as a general-purpose, ad hoc modeling tool that is open-ended and accessible for many, and on the other, whole software applications whether packaged or custom developed are generally more powerful in important ways but usually sacrifice accessibility and generalizability. This project will produce a prototype of a collaborative integrated development environment for modeling that manages code and data. The technical feasibility of this prototype will be evaluated by developing a test framework that simulates the divergence and convergence of models and scores the outcomes. The commercial feasibility will be evaluated by testing with users building real models to understand the scope of functionality required to bring this to market.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project appears in three areas.  First, there is an $8B
    dollar market for legacy hardware network security products today that is in transition
    to Software Defined Security. Adoption of this general SDSec platform has the
    potential to accelerate that market transition and improve enterprise security.
    \ Second, this project's success as an open platform could dramatically shorten
    the time between research insight and at-scale production deployments; security
    software built to a lower bar of scale/resiliency is faster and easier to build.
    The end result will be an increased rate of innovation, and new markets for niche,
    fit-for-purpose security functions that today are not profitable for vendors to
    build.  Last, this platform could harmonize enterprise security investments and
    practices for on premise workloads with security investments for public cloud
    workloads, solving a key dilemma faced by leading IT organizations. This will
    make those organizations more competitive on the world stage.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the two hardest technical
    challenges in building an enterprise-grade network security function, scale and
    resiliency, in a general way that can be applied to both new products and legacy
    codebases with no code change. Addressing scale/resiliency problems in a general
    way across many network security functions is novel, and this particular approach
    of massively parallel, lightweight packet processing functions to achieve this
    is new to this domain.  Why now? The massively parallel design proposed here is
    far too expensive and impractical with traditional hardware-based network functions.
    Even traditional hypervisor-based virtual machines carry too much hardware overhead
    to make this design cost competitive. By using vSwitches and network security
    functions packaged as Linux containers, the hardware overhead cost per instance
    drops dramatically, and this class of approach for scale/resiliency may be proven
    practical."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new approach to analyzing and understanding concisely structured documents such as legal contracts. The success of this project would provide a technological disruption in the way legal documents are processed. This will result in reduced processing time and financial savings in the review of legal contracts. Moreover, achieving this level of disruption within the legal market has the potential to open the door to automate processing, improve quality, and reduce the cost of many other legal services impacting the entire economy. With a market size of $437 Billion within the US alone, the legal industry is ready for a technological disruption that would bring this market up to par with other industries that have been significantly improved with the adoption of cutting edge Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This underlines the massive commercial potential for the technology under development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues a new innovative approach to understanding and analyzing contracts with accuracy comparable to what can be achieved by humans. Regardless of the technology, accuracy is the most important metric for lawyers to trust and adopt this innovation. Standard NLP techniques cannot generate the desired level of accuracy without a new approach to the problem.  The approach proposed for this project creates innovative custom-defined rules that operate using standard NLP technologies to break a contract into a data structure capturing different aspects of the contract meaning and allowing a higher level of understanding for the contract. In order to achieve the desired accuracy, a new innovative recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to learn over the extracted contract-meaning-data-structure which significantly improves the accuracy of the entire system. These two steps form somewhat orthogonal learning processes and when coupled with human-supervised-learning can produce the desired accuracy. This project will allow a full assessment of the underlying technology by training the core engine on a sufficiently large corpus of contracts to test the hypothesis on a larger scale.

With the growing threat of attacks at the web application layer, security is a top of mind concern for both the developers and users of web applications. At the same time, defending against these attacks is a resource-intensive, error-prone process that typically is performed manually by specialized web security experts. The project will use application-aware analysis and an innovative information model to automatically build and deploy web security policies on enterprise servers, freeing the enterprise to focus on their core business and reduce the overhead of internal security teams. The project will also use a hybrid static/dynamic analysis to automatically craft server-side and client-side policies using modern web protection mechanisms to give users of web applications confidence that their interactions with a web application will be secure. This approach leverages cutting-edge techniques from program analysis and machine learning, and will advance the state of the art in automated security policy generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore ways in which automated security policies enact meaningful protection of sensitive resources. Protecting web applications is a challenging research problem in that automated approaches are either biased towards significant false positive rates, in which benign behavior is flagged as malicious, or significant false negative rates, in which malicious activity is not detected. This project aims to resolve this bias using application aware whitelists: the project automatically explores an application's behavior dynamically, and will also statically build a model of that application's purpose. The project is expected to yield two major components: a server-side protection module to isolate and harden sensitive resources on an enterprise deployment, and a client-side protection module to enforce fine-grained policies for users of the enterprise's web applications. The project will involve developing, analyzing, and improving both of these components using large-scale web applications and will integrate the experience and challenges of enterprises with leading web applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make it cheaper and faster for architects, urban planners, and real-estate developers (APDs), as well as many others, to work with detailed models of the real world. Designers in APD fields must visualize and render their projects in the context of the real world. Pictures, videos, 3D printing, and even virtual reality inform the design process and facilitate communication with lay customers and stakeholders. These applications require consistently detailed models of the built world, and this project will automate the generation of these models. We estimate that APDs spend at least $80M annually creating these models by hand; and that at least $300M more is spent on such models for simulations, special effects, and video game design. By algorithmically generating virtual models without human intervention, the significant cost (in time and money) of manual creation will be saved, freeing design professionals to do work they want to be doing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed models of the world for diverse commercial applications. The first hurdle is solving the problem of reconstructing surfaces representing the boundaries of real-world solids (buildings) from noisy point cloud data. While surface reconstruction is well-studied in a variety of contexts, it remains an open problem in general, as successful algorithms must be informed by priors on the intended datasets. Using a data-driven approach to segment and classify input point clouds will facilitate the application of different reconstruction techniques to different objects (e.g. trees or buildings). The second hurdle is development of a machine learning algorithm which handles the dual problems of procedural modeling and inverse procedural modeling from a single statistical model, enabling visually realistic predictions about the details of a given building, even when that information is not available from source data (which may be of inconsistent quality across a large geographic area).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be large: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making; the project has the potential to make real estate sales and marketing more efficient by allowing buyers and sellers to accurately represent properties online, reducing the need for on-site visits. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second exciting effect of the proposal will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic 3D models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware, near instantaneous creation of 3D models on device, and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work might include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create a 3D model of a physical site in order to document it. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids.  In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    \ This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as Age Related Macular Degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to get American's to consume more lutein and
    zeaxanthin, which will be achieved by increasing significantly the levels of these
    antioxidants in the most widely grown staple crop: Corn. Since corn is used in
    a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving the carotenoid content
    of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of health
    benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing consumers eating
    habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically feasible, corn
    varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that are also high in
    grain yield. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop genetic markers
    for favorable alleles of genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis and stability.
    There is considerable genetic variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability, however, the most favorable alleles are typically not found in
    varieties that are commercially relevant to US corn production. Thus, the development
    of genetic markers will enable favorable alleles to be moved from lower yielding
    germplasm that is not well adapted to the US Corn Belt into elite inbreds suitable
    for the production of yield-competitive commercial F1 hybrids for the US market.
    The primary goal of this Phase I research is to create user-friendly genetic markers
    associated with favorable alleles for 12 key genes associated with carotenoid
    biosynthesis and stability. These markers will then be validated for efficacy
    by testing their ability to create progenies with higher carotenoid production,
    particularly lutein and zeaxanthin. This will result in a set of markers and experimental
    breeding materials that can be used to rapidly develop fixed inbreds for use in

    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer
    new business opportunities for small operators.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be
    used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be
    used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques
    for more effective water flooding and enhanced oil recovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project relates to the fact that the extraction and consumption of fossil carbon accounts for over 6 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.  While some mitigation approaches are fairly mature, like capturing CO2 for equestration or for enhanced oil recovery, they are very expensive in terms of both variable and capital costs and have little chance of ever providing a return on investment.  By not viewing fossil fuels and feedstocks through a circular economy lens, we estimate these companies miss an opportunity for approximately $50 billion per year in potential profit from hydrocarbons, including methanol, that could be made with waste CO2. If successful, our HI-Light reactor will enable a new economy based on the conversion of fugitive CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and solve the return on investment problem.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HI-Light, a solar-thermocatalytic "reverse combustion" technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other hydrocarbons at rate significantly greater than the state of the art. Previous approaches are limited by two roadblocks: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented, multiscale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.  The unique features of our reactor are (1) optimized light delivery to ensure that all of the catalyst material has enough light to activate the reaction and (2) an advanced nano-engineered photocatalyst which is functionalized with ligands to enhance CO2 capture and conversion.  The goal of this Phase I effort is to construct an integrated prototype reactor and evaluate its productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour and demonstrate a 10x improvement over the state of the art.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be the development of a dynamic thermal analysis system for use in aseptic food processing.  The true value of thermal properties for specific food products is required for the design of a thermal process to prevent possible bacterial contamination due to underheating, or degradation and formation of unwanted compounds due to overheating.  The proposed innovation would allow food processors to improve their understanding of thermal properties in rapid heating applications, and by validating novel food processing technologies. The impact is expected to be that the quality and nutritional value of aseptic processed foods should increase dramatically as it will eliminate the need to excessively overcook products to ensure their safety. The commercial impact of this research will be through enhancing the quality of aseptic processed food and of rapidly heated batter-based foods. As the aseptic food quality will be further enhanced compared to that of canned and frozen alternatives, this technology will also increase the growth of the rapidly growing aseptic food industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial prototype device capable of rapidly measuring the thermal properties of a material over a range of temperatures. Currently, there is no way to quickly measure properties, which are necessary for accurate modeling of rapid heating processes such as those used for aseptic food processing and for foods baked between hot irons, such as burgers. Without rapid measurement, the food product deteriorates before taking measurements. Phase I research should develop, build, and validate a physical prototype and associated software. Control and data acquisition software, along with data analysis and parameter estimation software, will be finalized and validated. The device will be tested against materials with known parameters to statistically validate its performance and accuracy. Finally the device will be tested alongside the prior state-of-the-art to compare its performance to the industry standard. The product of this research will be a commercially-viable prototype that has been validated against literature values and has been demonstrated to outperform current devices. The device will be able to measure parameters over a range of temperatures more accurately and in a fraction of the time of current methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network infrastructure in data center networks.  While modern data centers leverage server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments in the lab have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The goal of this project is to run in a production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced with production conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to reduce the necessary supervision and oversight required to operate multiple unmanned platforms in the execution of real-world, specific, task-based activities supporting search and rescue, routine mapping and intelligence gathering missions.  Shifting control from teleoperation to autonomous navigation could enable first responders such as lifeguards, to quadruple their capacity to assist in mass, maritime disaster, rescue scenarios for example. The current practice of a single lifeguard handling 3 victims in a routine riptide incident will be improved by a factor of four, through the use of this technology, allowing lifeguards to better manage mass-scale, maritime disasters that may involve a hundred victims. Human lifeguards could focus on those people requiring immediate personal assistance (unconscious, hypothermia or children for instance), while unmanned maritime platforms could be tasked with responding to clusters of survivors better capable of self-rescue.  Lifeguard assistant robots can also help with the over 400,000 lower profile events in the US each year.  A robot could not only save lives but reduce risk to the lifeguard who typically has to swim or jet-ski out to provide flotation and rescue lines to victims in dangerous conditions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop increased intelligence and self-awareness for autonomous platforms that will result in an increase in operator ?trust? and allow potential operators who might consider autonomous platforms as ?unreliable? due to potential lost communication links, to have greater confidence in adopting these platforms.  The technology will transition from far field navigation control (such as waypoint based navigation) to a near field control allowing precision delivery of the platform to the desired location in a dynamic environment.  This capability would allow a maritime platform to autonomously drive to a designated cluster of survivors, slow down and behave according to known social proxemics so as not to further stress the victims.  On board, vehicle health monitoring would allow critical system parameters to be reported and broadcast allowing ad-hoc networking with other platforms in the region.  The overall objective would be to optimize the use of resources in any region and to quickly allow multiple lifeguard teams converging on a mass marine casualty event to interact but without having to pre-register or have a priori knowledge of each other?s systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to create a personalized, precision-based practice paradigm for surgery that improves surgical outcomes and reduces the cost of healthcare. This paradigm utilizes individual patient characteristics with machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict the risk of post-surgical complications. Additionally, it offers the possibility of enacting impactful interventions among high-risk patients, while reducing unnecessary therapies among low-risk patients, thereby improving surgical outcomes, maximizing the efficiency of healthcare, and minimizing cost. In a value-based care model, this paradigm aligns the goals of health systems, surgeons, and patients.

    The proposed project combines individual patient data with machine-learning algorithms to effectively predict surgical complication risk and improve surgical clinical outcomes. Currently, 13% of 50 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually result in a surgical complication, half which are potentially avoidable. A primary cause of avoidable complications include significant variable in risk assessment and standardized preventative practice. Therefore, the principal objective of this proposal is to develop machine-learning predictive models of various surgical complications (wound, cardiac, respiratory, renal, etc.), which provides an objective risk assessment for surgeons. Additionally, this risk assessment platform will allow stratification of patients into high- vs. low-risk categories and link patients with risk-appropriate preventative interventions at the point-of-care.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project proposes
    to develop an advanced non-contact, non-destructive monitoring technology to reliably
    identify early fatigue damage in pipelines, piping, and tubing. Current industry
    practice relies on statistically based, semi-empirical models that unfortunately
    can have an order of magnitude in error in predicting fatigue life, a leading
    failure mode in metals that are exposed to high cycling, high strain, and/or elevated
    pressures and temperatures. The United States infrastructure relies on millions
    of miles of pipes, pipelines, and tubing that are critical in the transport of
    valuable fluids serving a number of industries including municipal water, production
    and transport of oil and gas, and chemicals in processing plants. Unfortunately,
    this aging infrastructure can fail with disastrous consequences. \nThe successful
    development and commercialization of this new technology will be a great leap
    in integrity monitoring, resulting in significant reduction in costs and delays,
    and eliminating catastrophic failures in the field. The estimated total addressable
    market for pipeline and coil tubing monitoring are in excess of $4 billion annually.\n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this SBIR project centers on the demonstration of the technical
    and economic feasibility of this novel fatigue monitoring technology with a specific
    target of identifying when the material has reached 90% of its actual fatigue
    life. The technology is based on a novel electromagnetic measurement scheme that
    can effectively detect magnetic dislocations in the material which have been shown
    to be early indicators of failure due to fatigue. Using advanced analytics, strong
    correlations between the measured electromagnetic properties and fatigue life
    can provide a direct and reliable identifier of imminent fatigue damage without
    loss of material integrity. The major challenges that this SBIR effort proposes
    to address are (1) engineering an electromagnetic-based measurement technique
    with sufficient sensitivity to detect the magnetic defects seen in early fatigue
    damage under field operating conditions (2) developing appropriate detection algorithms
    to handle the statistical variations affecting fatigue damage and (3) engineering
    a cost-effective monitoring solutions compared with alternative fatigue management
    practices."

    The broader reaching impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project stems from the development and application of a new generation of cost-effective devices that can efficiently recover, preserve and quantify airborne microbes in near real time.  An improved ability to characterize the microbiology of indoor aerosols has a multitude of important engineering and public health benefits for urban society. This includes a vastly improved ability to monitor bioaerosols in health care settings; in water-damaged buildings; in plane/rail/bus transportation centers; as well as other high-density public venues.  Through this work, emerging aerosol technology will be optimized and deployed in portable instrumentation that reports what currently marketed aerosol monitoring equipment cannot provide: the identity, distribution and abundance of airborne microorganisms indoors.  This approach provides an unprecedented path to compile large exposure databases, which enable the scientific and medical community to better understand the potential effects of indoor microbial air pollution.  Compared to conventional aerosol sampling, these new filter-less devices require little human oversite, communicate aerosol data to cloud-based servers, and preserve bioaerosol samples with exceptional fidelity.  These next generation instruments provide an innovative, unobtrusive and practical method for surveying the indoor air we breathe every day, in near real-time.

    This STTR Phase I project integrates portable lasers for real-time microbe enumeration, with humidity controls that efficiently recover bacteria, fungi and pollen from indoor air. This advanced equipment assembly accurately counts, preserves and concentrates airborne microbes for stringent biochemical analysis that is relevant to public health.  The opportunity for this new instrumentation leverages the fundamental technological advantages it has over conventional sampling equipment, which until now predominantly relies on filtering large quantities of indoor air.   The mechanical stresses microbes must endure during conventional air filtration, seriously compromises the accuracy of airborne microbial analyses.  The research objective of this work is to challenge this novel instrumentation array with known quantities of airborne microbes that commonly inhabit the indoor environment.  Using widely accepted engineering and biochemistry methods, the overarching goal is to systematically validate the efficiency of this new equipment, both in the laboratory and in the field.  We anticipate markedly better quantitative recovery of airborne microbial activity and genetic material (DNA) where directly compared to its filter-based counterparts.  Thus, the commercial and societal value of this new instrumentation is realized through displacing outmoded aerosol collection methods with highly efficient filter-less air sampling devices, outfitted with modern optics and digital automation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the impact of precision medicine by simultaneously addressing large-scale medical data aggregation and optimized computation that is cost-effective and to extend the utility of medical informatics well beyond current practice. Patient medical information comes in many diverse forms: genomic sequences, medical images, and clinical observations. The integration of these various data sources across patient populations have shown to reveal patterns and similarities among patients, which inform treatment options. With advances in imaging and genomic sequencing technologies, the sheer volume of available information is growing exponentially, straining current computational approaches, and creating an imminent need for scalable data integration. The ability to overcome this data mountain opens the door to support advanced analytics to support precision medicine and provide enhanced services to medical institutions. With these innovations, patients receive faster and more accurate diagnoses and treatments, clinicians deliver verified treatment decisions through patient cohort comparison, hospitals have better standard of care, and society is overall empowered by supporting global treatment options and well informed pharmaceutical development.

    The proposed project will develop a scalable aggregation and analysis framework to integrate various patient data modalities to inform personalized diagnosis and therapy in precision medicine. Currently, information from different modalities exists in silos, hindering joint analysis and insight. While there has been research trying to leverage machine learning techniques in medical imaging, these efforts have generally focused on a single domain and not been able to integrate facts from other domains. This project will aggregate features from genomics, imaging and clinical characterization of patients into scalable databases and then use a distributed, parallel framework to enable efficient analytics on the resultant joint representation. The resulting platform will enable identification of cohorts based on both genotypes and phenotypes and empower powerful machine learning analyses to inform clinical decision systems or identification of new personalized therapies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to standardize the process of securing and protecting umbilical cord catheters. These catheters are inserted into newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are used to provide life-saving nutrients and medication directly into their bloodstream. Unfortunately, the infection rate associated with these catheters is among the highest in the healthcare system. There is an important need for a simple medical device that reduces the risk of infection. A reduction in infection rate would save hospitals hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they must currently absorb the cost of treating these infections. Most importantly, reducing umbilical catheter infection rates would save neonatal lives in any hospital setting.

    The proposed project will develop a standardized device that reliably secures umbilical cord catheters and protects the catheter insertion site from various sources of infection. The current standard of care for securing these catheters in NICUs across the United States is a roll of non-sterile tape that offers no protective barrier to the catheter insertion site. This is in stark contrast to medical devices that are used with adult catheters and help prevent bloodstream infections. The research objectives include evaluating different materials, testing the catheter securement mechanism, testing bacterial colonization rates, and evaluating the device?s biosafety for use on neonatal skin. This will be accomplished using custom-built testing rigs and protocols. We anticipate the successful development of a device with material specifications that allow for clinical testing in the NICU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit nearly 6 million children per year who are suspected of having abnormal Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) which can lead to a more serious condition with numerous complications referred to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Current detection paradigms include costly and invasive procedures that often require overnight hospitalization, prescribing pharmacological Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) without objective evidence and or exposure to radiological imaging.  The outcomes of this project will lead to a low cost, non-invasive method for detecting GER, without requiring hospitalization.  This will facilitate earlier detection of GER and reduce overall healthcare costs and burdens associated with GERD and its accompanying complications.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using single point ultrasonic transducers to non-invasively detect and characterize reflux.  Current reflux detection relies on impedance and pH probes which are placed in the patient?s esophagus through a nasogastric probe.  This often requires anesthesia and overnight hospital observation which is costly, invasive, and prone to artifacts that change the reflux episodes normally experienced by the patient.  Ultrasonic imaging can observe reflux occurring in the esophagus but requires hundreds of ultrasonic transducers in a single probe and a trained clinician to manually observe and identify the reflux events.  These two factors make ultrasonic imaging costly to use and prevents it from being used for extended periods of time, which is necessary to determine if abnormal amounts of reflux are occurring.  The proposed project will use ultrasonic imaging as a control method to demonstrate the ability of single point ultrasonic transducers to generate an acoustic signature capable of detecting whether the esophagus is expanded or collapsed to identify episodes of reflux.  Detection and characterization of reflux through single point transducers would ultimately enable the development of a portable, safe, and accurate home monitoring device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering and enhance the workflow efficiency in physically-based rendering. This can impact a broad range of industries, including video games, product visualization, animation, visual effects, scientific rendering and virtual/augmented reality. The superior performance and greatly reduced cost will allow the same system to be used in the manufacturing industry, which requires high-resolution depth measurement. This technology will result in the broader adoption of non-contact 3D metrology and 3D machine vision for manufacturing quality control and defect inspection.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot decouple the direct reflection and sub-surface scattering. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance and greatly reduced cost.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help establish a commercially viable method for mass production of high-efficiency heat exchangers for the rapid advancement of thermoelectric solar cells and waste heat management. The advancement to be made in this project will help harvest an enormous amount of solar energy and heat energy from the environment. Thermal energy from natural (solar, geothermal etc.) as well as from man-made thermal sources is a continuously available, and currently underutilized resource with the potential to become an important pillar of renewable energy. The solar thermoelectric devices require minimal maintenance and are suitable for deployment in remote regions. The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the performance of solar thermoelectric generators. Besides harnessing solar energy, thermoelectric devices can also be used for waste heat recovery from automobile exhaust and industries using high-temperature furnaces to enhance fuel efficiency and generate electricity for automotive operations. Our estimated outcome can enhance the fuel efficiency of automobile engines by 15-20 %with around $67 billion annual reductions in gasoline expenses and around 570 billion pound reduction in annual carbon emission.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a disruptive technology to improve the efficiency of thermoelectric devices. Currently, the efficiency of thermoelectric devices is much lower than their theoretical values due to the lack of ideal heat exchanger materials for both hot and cold ends. The research goal is to enhance current module efficiency by more than 90%. The project includes testing and validation of the heat exchanger into thermoelectric generation modules for solar electricity generation and waste heat management from thermal sources at different temperatures, as well as developing methods for mass production of heat exchanger materials. The size of the treated surfaces can be well controlled, making it possible to fabricate microscale solar thermal devices for infrared sensors and night vision cameras.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable doctors to maximize the diagnostic information extracted from costly Pediatric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Annually, approximately 3.5 million brain MRI scans are performed with average prices with interpretation from $500 - $2,000. Even though the scans are expensive to acquire and interpret, doctors generally only use visual inspection of the images to diagnose abnormalities. The proposed software will be relatively cheap compared to the overall cost of an MRI and is expected to let doctors make accurate measurements of key structures in the brain. This is important because developmental and other diseases can cause small volume and surface area changes that cannot be easily seen by the human eye. By detecting these changes early, doctors should be able to treat the disease at early stages, potentially leading to better quality of life and financial savings. The proposed tool is also expected to enable doctors to better track treatment outcomes, by measuring the effect a drug or treatment has on particular structures in the brain. Ultimately, it is expected that the proposed technology will improve quality of care as well as reduce healthcare costs.

    The proposed project leverages current advances in computational technology such as machine learning and computer vision to automatically measure volume, surface area and shapes in critical parts of the brain in children. These measurements are then compared to a large database of children over the ages of 0-12 years to determine if they have deviated from normal. Although MRIs have been increasing adopted as the diagnostic tool of choice for childhood brain disorders due to the lack of radiation, there has yet to be a tool that allows doctors to accurately measure changes in a child's brain from MRI scans. Because, in children, the brain is rapidly changing as she/he grows, it is difficult to determine visually whether the changes are due to normal development or disease. By measuring the brain accurately and comparing it to a large database already collected by the proposing team, it is expected that a pediatric doctor will be able to determine whether a child's brain has deviated from normal. It could also allow physicians to better select treatments and monitor the patient response to a specific therapy.

    Research (SBIR) project is to engineer brewer's yeast for a more consistent, cost-effective,
    and sustainable brewing process. The flowers of hop plants provide both bitterness
    and \"hoppy\" flavor to beer. Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive
    crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it expensive and difficult
    to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.  The goal is to engineer brewer's
    yeast to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor
    to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil.
    Over the last two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for
    beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries
    to source (total domestic hop sales have tripled over the last 10 years due to
    heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources:
    ~100 trillion liters of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops.
    Reducing the reliance of the brewing industry on hops would significantly increase
    the sustainability of the brewing process by decreasing water usage, also leading
    to the commercial benefits of decreased brewing costs and greater consistency
    of beer flavor.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer the biosynthesis
    of hop-derived monoterpenes in brewer's yeast to meet the following industrial
    performance requirements: 1) Normal propagation and fermentation characteristics,
    2) precise and robust production of monoterpenes at scale, and 3) the absence
    of off-flavors. The proposed research sets out to test whether the expression
    of 5 key biosynthesis pathway enzymes can be expressed in a way that each of these
    performance requirements is met in a single strain.  Recently developed synthetic
    biology tools will be used to create hundreds of DNA constructs, each containing
    a different combination of promoters driving expression of the 4 corresponding
    genes (designs).  Incorporating genetically stable DNA constructs into brewer's
    yeast is complicated by their polyploid genome. To overcome this difficulty, preliminary
    work was conducted to develop a Cas9-mediated integration strategy, which leverages
    a colorometric assay to assist with the challenge of identifying stable pathway
    transformants.  Strains will be constructed and evaluated in two subsequent rounds.
    \ In the first round, a diverse set of designs will be explored, and in a second
    round, strains will be constructed based on the designs that most closely meet
    with performance requirements and avoid production of potential off-flavors."

The proposal aligns closely with U.S. government programs such as Manufacturing USA and the National Robotics Initiative. The World Economic Forum reported recently that manufacturing has been immensely important to the prosperity of nations. This has never been more true than right now as countries compete to make huge investments in the digital transformation process of their manufacturing firms. The innovation provides significant advancement that is expected to boost U.S. worker productivity, advance wireless innovation and increase cost savings and business agility. The Industrial Internet of Things drives new investment in automated factories, industrial digital networks and integration with real-time edge computing. Data expansion at the edge of today's networks are new challenges for industrial firms that seek to deploy flexible and economically viable digital infrastructure. The company provides an innovative solution that enables wireless edge computing. Instead of expensive and inflexible wired networks, this new technology unlocks the full potential of wireless sensor networks for automation and control systems. 

    The proposed project will demonstrate the company's concept of ultra-secure, highly reliable, time-sensitive/synchronized wireless protocol for Industrial IoT markets. The novel system design is a general purpose, extremely low latency, wireless communications link that supports real-time connection to industrial devices. The company's technology operates chaos-based spread spectrum communications links, functional chaos-based IIoT sub-nets with anticipated scalability of a plurality of sub-nets operating within unlicensed bands. Enabling an extreme precision time synchronization is critical to industrial systems and network applications in time-sensitive edge computing networks. To date, standard access technologies such as Ethernet are not deterministic and clock synchronization protocols are fundamentally limited by the characteristics of packet switching or efficient access to reliable clocks. In particular, legacy network's jitter, packet buffering and scheduling in switches and network stack overheads add non-deterministic variances to the round trip time, which must be accurately measured to synchronize clocks. This proposal is for a wireless-based synchronization technology that uses more granular timing mechanisms to achieve nanosecond precision. The company introduces a clock synchronization protocol that uses wireless chaotic waveforms that connects to network devices for decentralized clock synchronization. This eliminates the need for wires and non-deterministic elements in clock synchronization protocols.

    This SBIR Phase I project uses artificial intelligence techniques to identify the ways that undergraduate students in scientific courses explicate problems, describe procedures, make claims, provide evidence, offer qualifications, and draw conclusions. With emphasis on forms of scientific reasoning, this new use of artificial intelligence, to identify language patterns associated with scientific reasoning, will allow students to improve their written laboratory reports before they are submitted, therefore freeing instructors to devote precious instructional time to preparing students for roles as practicing scientists. As the U.S. continues to experience rapid diversity growth, this focus on helping students through innovative uses of technology holds the potential to expand science education by cultivating student ability through autonomous writing and revision. Because artificial intelligence techniques are intended to expand capabilities, the techniques being used, available 24/4 on the web, will have the direct impact of growing our technical and scientific workforce, thus expanding the many dynamic pathways to STEM occupations. As the NSF observed in 2015 in its report Revisiting the STEM Workforce, these jobs are extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness and are essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness. An investment in such a technology is thus an investment in national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and workforce diversity.

    NSF SBIR support will be used to design and launch artificial intelligence techniques based on Deep Artificial Neural Network (DANN) as driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the latest advances in AI algorithms. Because NLP and LSA techniques are presently used solely to identify grammatical and organizational patterns, the application of DANN is high risk in making a leap from identifying patterns of language use to capturing patterns of scientific reasoning. Trained on a proprietary corpus of 100,000 lab reports scored and annotated by instructors and students using a single rubric, the AI application will identify logic structures of scientific reasoning in student laboratory reports. Once methodically identified, categorized according to ability level, and validated by STEM instructors, digital instruction will be used to help students improve their scientific reasoning processes. With the singular goal of structuring student success through asynchronous machine learning, this innovation holds the promise to figure meaningfully in discussions of national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and diversity as related to STEM education.

    This STTR Phase I project will enable the rapid prototyping and manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) components with 3D printing, and thereby reduce component cost, weight, and turnaround time. The global RF components market is expected to reach $17.54 billion by 2022, but fabrication techniques for commercial RF components have seen little innovation. Conventional RF manufacturing techniques, such machining and photolithography, are accurate and reliable, but they are also expensive, time-consuming and produce unnecessary waste. 3D printing enables fast and accurate manufacturing of custom components, as well as the creation of extremely complex geometries at low-cost for improved component performance. 3D printing can also enable users to design components to fit the design space available, removing the necessity of designing technology around commercially available parts, a critical feature in space and weight-sensitive aerospace applications. However, the materials available to 3D printing are mostly limited to non-conducting polymers. By creating a highly conductive 3D printing material, and testing the properties of RF components made with this filament, this project will make it possible to rapidly prototype and produce custom RF components, thereby accelerating research and improving the competitiveness of RF component manufacturing in the U.S.

    This STTR proposal will create a highly conductive (>2×10^5 S m-1) polymer filament that can be used with low-cost fused deposition modeling 3D printers to create a variety of high-value RF components. The filament will be engineered to print reliably, and retain its conductivity and mechanical integrity to temperatures of ~150 °C. To achieve these goals, the proposed work will determine the relationship between conductivity, the loading of conductive filler, the shape of the conductive filler, the filament mechanical properties, and the viscosity of the filament at printing temperatures. New methods will be developed to prevent oxidation of the conductive filler at elevated temperatures. A novel conductive filler will be developed to achieve these performance specifications at low cost. Concurrent with these material development efforts, novel RF components will be designed, simulated, and printed in order to build a comprehensive database with detailed designs and printing parameters for producing the RF components with a low failure rate. By the end of this project, users will be able to design, predict, and reliably print RF components with conductive filament on low-cost 3D printers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an engineered nonmodel yeast platform for
    the economical and sustainable production of natural aroma compounds. High quality
    aroma compounds have a variety of applications, ranging from flavor and fragrance
    to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. With the strong consumer demand for more natural
    alternatives to chemically synthesized ingredients in both food and personal care
    items, the production of these ingredients by fermentation will add a renewable
    source to the supply chain and will reduce demand on botanical sources. This work
    will advance methodologies and knowledge for creating novel microbial cell factories
    via 13C-metabolite tracing, metabolic flux analysis, fermentation optimization,
    and kinetic modeling. The lessons from this research will offer general guidelines
    for overcoming biosynthesis hurdles and optimizing bioprocess operations, and
    will facilitate the development of transferable technologies for inexpensive production
    of diverse natural products that are broadly used for human health and wellness.
    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural
    aroma compounds. Because plants carry aroma compounds in extremely low amounts,
    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these
    challenges, this project will develop a novel fermentation process for production
    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.
    Ultimately, this environmentally friendly process would provide a new, reliable
    and natural manufacture scheme to meet the growing demand of consumers for healthier
    products."

    This SBIR Phase I project will research the feasibility of applying virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in manufacturing and material testing training programs to increase academic achievement, accelerate progress toward degree and foster more effective use of expensive lab-equipment.  According to 2014 statistics, in the United States, less than 40% of students entering college in STEM fields finish with a STEM degree. And even for those who finish, a majority (over 60% ) take several years longer than the nominal time of 4 years. Providing students with VR and AR enabled personalized manufacturing labs is a promising way to increase students' engagement and better prepare them for future careers as well as broaden students' outlook on innovation. As described in the recent US council report on competitiveness, advanced manufacturing has the largest multiplier effect on jobs. In order for the US to gain competitiveness in this sector, there is a pressing need for a trained workforce that is able to develop new materials testing protocols and manufacturing processes. This SBIR project aims to develop technologies that enable the education sector to leverage VR and AR to accelerate training. Proposed software will be evaluated through pilot testing. Technology and insights resulting from this project may find applications in other domains such as life sciences.


    Key technical innovations in this proposed research include the development of a novel high-fidelity modular virtual object model, customized task models based on evidence centered design, and methods to flexibly combine object models with task models to rapidly develop activities suitable for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. These innovations may significantly reduce the content creation cost and potentially dissolve the boundary between classroom education and hands-on training, providing an effective and seamless educational experience. In the long term, these innovations may also be applied broadly to training in other domains. The overarching goal of this SBIR project is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system for content creation and learning analytics and apply them to create innovative content for use in manufacturing courses. The proposed system and content will be evaluated via pilot testing with engineering students to collect rich datasets comprising videos, sensor time series data and simulation-event logs. Data analysis will seek evidence for changes in both students outcomes (changes in content knowledge, engagement, attitude towards engineering, self-efficacy towards learning engineering, usability of the product) and instructor outcomes (attitudes about the usefulness of the product).

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of the Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a bioreactor that may be used for production and expansion of cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery.  While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of an instrument to address the
    scaling and regulatory challenges of quality control that increase cost and impede
    large scale deployment of cellular therapies to a wide patient base. Cellular
    therapies taking advantage of engineered human cells have shown incredible potential
    as \"living drugs\" that achieve personalized therapies for cancer patients. Recent
    improvements in these therapies have shown their efficacy in targeting and killing
    specific types of leukemias. In light of these successes, more and more research
    and clinical trials are being proposed to improve current efficacy in treating
    blood cancers and adapting these therapies to other cancers types. While showing
    promise in the fight against cancer, there is growing concern over the manufacturability
    of clinical doses, especially when scaling up to meet global demands. Additionally,
    the speed at which these therapies are being developed is causing regulatory agencies
    to lag behind in terms of quality control and release criteria. Both of these
    issues will need to be addressed as cellular therapies continue to improve and
    increase in demand. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated
    quality control instrument for the manufacture of cellular therapies, which centers
    around a disruptive new technology called ratcheting cytometry. Currently, quality
    control of therapeutic cell batches remains difficult to standardize and scale
    given the plethora of standalone tools needed to adequately characterize each
    batch. This modular approach has high capital cost, high recurring maintenance
    costs, and requires skilled technicians. Ideally, the capabilities of these standalone
    tools can be combined into one automated system to provide standardized metrics
    for cellular therapy quality without user variability. Leveraging well-established
    immunomagnetic cell labeling techniques, ratcheting cytometry is able combine
    the capabilities of quality control tools by individually measuring magnetic content
    and gating based on surface expression. Leveraging these advantages, the goal
    is to demonstrate feasibility for an integrated instrument to quantify cell number,
    viability, surface expression, and cytokine secretion of therapeutic cell batches
    in a single step assay."

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor
    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,
    and to implement on-chip blood plasma separation for PT/INR measurements."

    This project researches and develops a novel mathematics communication and collaboration system. Mathematics is the foundation of Science and Technology, and national competence in the STEM fields is essential to maintaining our competitive edge on a global scale. Math literacy hinges on effective communication of mathematical concepts and processes. However, despite significant advances in pedagogical methods, the way we communicate mathematics remains curiously behind the times. Preliminary customer and market research has revealed that the lack of adequate communication tools for mathematical and technical expressions is holding back the advance of mathematics in online environments such as online tutoring. Moreover, the scarcity of effective communication tools has reinforced the long-standing preconception that math is primarily a solitary activity, and it has created an unintended and harmful selection bias restricting the diversity of students entering STEM fields. This project fills the void of adequate math communications tools with an dynamic, interactive system for communicating mathematical derivations in real-time in an online environment. The system facilitates student-student and student-teacher remote communication of mathematics, and it is particularly suited for student-tutor communication on online tutoring platforms.

    The math communication and collaboration system this project develops leverages the company's proprietary equation manipulation technology. This system employs an integrated math engine and a touch-based interface allowing users to manipulate equations using simple drag-and-drop gestures. It is built on a game-engine allowing for multi-player support. This project integrates the equation manipulation technology into a networked multi-user interface to connect one or more users for real-time communication of mathematical derivations. The project researches the precise needs of students, teachers, and online tutors to tailor the user interface to the specific needs of online mathematics communication. Specific problems the project researches include multi-player networking and matchmaking functionality, optimal network architecture for the system, transfer of control between users for effective communication, integration of traditional communication tools within the system, and reduction of latency time to enhance real-time interactivity. Successful completion of the project will result in a first-of-its-kind math communication system that allows users in different places to connect online and communicate a mathematical derivation as it is happening, and as easily as if they were in the same room. The primary project deliverable is a minimum viable product to be piloted and vetted through the company?s existing math app.
