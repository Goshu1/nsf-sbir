    Research Phase I project is to develop an effective cost saving screening technology
    based on molecular modeling for separating molecules that are identical except
    for geometric differences, that are present in the development of pure orphan
    drugs.  The separation of these molecules from one another is both important and
    challenging, since while one molecular form can have beneficial therapeutic value,
    the other molecular form can at best be benign but often can also be toxic. The
    implementation of this proposed strategy should have a significant impact on the
    rapid development of new medicines especially those being formulated by drug manufacturers
    with limited R&D resources. Ultimately, a successful outcome from this project
    will accelerate drug discovery in pharmaceutical companies and allow for unique
    drug formulations to be available in the market to consumers that are relying
    on them for treatment and to extend their life.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this Phase I research project are to develop a predictive molecular model which
    can guide experimentation in purifying chiral molecules for pharmaceutical companies
    to use in drug formulations. Over the past decade, the efforts in the pharmaceutical
    community have shifted to studying pure chiral drugs rather than racemic mixtures
    due to the discovery that certain enantiomers may have negative implications on
    the human body by causing toxicity or certain defects. Owed to the possibility
    of harmful side effects from racemic mixtures, the commercial focus has turned
    to purifying pharmaceutical drugs to create an enantio-pure chiral product. The
    modeling tools to be built will take advantage of significant proprietary data
    Orochem has developed in the past few years as part of their R&D activities in
    developing new and innovative methods for the separation of racemic mixtures of
    enantiomers. The initial molecular model will demonstrate interaction between
    a Chiral Stationary Phase, mobile phase, and enantiomers known to be resolved
    by the particular system.  The dynamic model will allow examination of conformations
    of the enantiomer within the chiral separation system in a more detailed fashion
    since molecular modeling input parameters include detail on the bond, angle, and
    dihedral energies present in molecules of the racemate. Overall, molecular simulations
    of chromatographic separations will lessen the time of discovery of systems for
    separating these chiral isomers by leading experimental investigation and aiding
    research scientists at pharmaceutical companies to identify suitable chiral stationary
    phases apriori. This will reduce both the cost and time of bringing new drugs
    to market."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to overcome some of the current
    lack of similar devices for screening and monitoring of PAD and will allow greater
    access at lower cost for current and future patients suffering from PAD. Today,
    hospitalization costs for diagnosis and treatment of PAD patients exceed $10,000
    per patient for 8 to 10 million Americans suffering from lower-extremity PAD.
    The current options for PAD diagnosis are too expensive and impractical to monitor
    or diagnose the condition in its early stages before it is too late to initiate
    therapy to reverse or slow progress. Regular screening as well as monitoring of
    PAD after an initial diagnosis by medical professionals has the potential to significantly
    reduce the current cost of managing PAD patients, including prevention of many
    of the 150,000 ischemic amputations performed annually in the US through early
    intervention. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the need for a more practical,
    accessible, user-friendly, and inexpensive technique, for monitoring PAD. The
    proposed our transdermal gasotransmitter sensor employs an innovative, patented
    gas-phase detector to non-invasively provide real-time measure of the target molecule.
    It is anticipated that this approach would provide accurate, cost-effective monitoring
    of onset and severity through monitoring plasma H2S levels, which could also enable
    subsequent therapeutic measures in real-time. During this Phase I study, a prototype
    of a TGS module will be developed and its performance will be demonstrated. Prior
    data and results will be utilized to design and develop a breadboard prototype
    for remote gasotransmitter monitoring. Key technical challenges of developing
    a disposable sensor will be addressed, including size, cost, and ease of use.
    Feasibility will be tested under simulated laboratory conditions with membranes
    and animal skin. Furthermore, the breadboard prototype will be implemented in
    ongoing studies on healthy and diabetic rats. Building on Phase I findings, more
    advanced prototype development and further testing is planned for Phase II efforts."

    \ This project uses novel methods to improve Natural Language Processing and Machine

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be derived from the novel catalyst developed of the project. The project will, if successful, dramatically improve the efficiency and scope of a specific class of industrially significant chemical reactions which are indispensable for the manufacture of many useful products such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and electronics. The improvements, for example, will provide access to newer materials for the production of newer and improved related products to address unmet biological and engineering needs. The catalyst discoveries will also enhance the scientific knowledge base of both fundamental and applied catalysis science.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a collection of novel and improved organometallic catalysts for industrially relevant cross-coupling reactions; and to address current unmet industrial needs for higher catalyst efficiency, selectivity and scope of these reactions. The Phase I research will involve detailed and innovative investigations of the current state-of-the-art catalysts; systematic and iterative design, synthesis, and testing of the new organometallic catalysts; and demonstration of improved performance of the new catalysts in relevant cross-coupling reactions. The catalysis knowledge gained from this Phase I research will enable catalyst design and development efforts in the current project for specific industrial applications. The development and commercialization of a collection of new and improved catalysts in this Phase I project will significantly expand the efficiency and industrial utility of cross- coupling reactions towards creating new products based on this chemistry.

    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is in the development of low cost, environmentally-friendly coating materials for corrosion prevention. Corrosion is a significant global issue, resulting in high maintenance and repair costs. Current anti-corrosion coatings need an improvement in effective barrier against water or moisture. As a result, it is imperative to develop improved corrosion resistance coatings, leading to reduced downtime and damage to equipment and important infrastructure. This study aims to achieve the desired level of barrier properties necessary to significantly improve passive protection of the coated surface. These coating material developed will be sustainable and will use low cost clay as fillers to replace expensive Zinc fillers in coating formulations, completely or partially. The developed technology will have the potential to reduce damages due to corrosion in spectrum of industries spanning infrastructure, shipping, food containers, defense, and automobile domains. Primary fillers used will be non-toxic, abundantly available, versatile, low-cost, and easily adaptable with current coating manufacturing protocols, making them commercially viable. Successful completion of project phase I & II will result in advanced manufacturing job creation and reduce corrosion related costs in industry and improve infrastructure lifetime.

    The technical objective of this STTR Phase-I proposal is developing a platform technology for multi- functional low cost epoxy-based nanocomposite coatings for corrosion protection. The innovation in the proposed multi-functional coatings lay in deriving the benefits of various fillers and a combinatorial approach to synergistic harvesting of functionality and robustness. Polymer nanocomposites provide an opportunity to harness the maximum benefits of properties when fillers are uniformly dispersed in the host matrix. The structural integrity of metal and its products is directly dependent on its anti-corrosive properties, which can be enhanced using modified clay as fillers. Passive and active protection against corrosion reaction can be achieved by using transition metal ion modified clay as a filler coupled with dispersion and improved polymer-filler interactions. As part of this STTR Phase-I award we will optimize the formulations such that corrosion resistance and other key properties of coatings are enhanced. The validated corrosion resistance coatings will then be translated towards commercial success by: i) producing and benchmarking novel coating formulations for corrosion resistance, ii) scaling-up the production process, iii) mathematical modeling for recursive design of these coatings. At end of the project we will have a superior low cost multi-functional coating with lower toxic footprint.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans the near-term and many years of future development. Over both phases, this proposal covers research and development (R&D) to create a robot pet companions with the potential to sell millions of units in the U.S. toy industry. The proposal also supports the development of R&D infrastructure that will be a critical component of the expansion in subsequent years to the U.S. pet industry (as a robot companion), which is larger and has less direct competition for robotic entrants. The first-generation robot product, a result of the Phase I project, will support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and robot hobbyists of all ages by facilitating user-friendly modification of its hardware and software as well as the creation of users? own robots and behavioral programs. Given the interactive nature of these modifiable robots, they are likely to have a strong appeal to females, who are underrepresented in STEM fields. The project?s ultimate goal is to develop and market interactive robots that can improve the quality of life for anyone through companionship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop first-generation robot pets that will be ready to place in thousands of customers? hands and to situate the awarded company to grow to deliver millions of sophisticated robot pets across the world, including to the many people who cannot have pets. Towards these outcomes, the following innovations will be pursued in Phase I: a puppeteer platform that wirelessly controls robot characters; specification of a mobile, social robot character through machine learning; perception of robots and their environment; reliable autonomous recharging; and a simple cloud-based infrastructure for gathering usage data and conducting field experiments on versions of robot characters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to develop short term Solar irradiance forecasting, will be to support very large deployment of Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generation capacity, by reducing the cost of mitigating cloud caused fluctuation of SPV electricity generation. This increased SPV system deployment will reduce the amount of base load and peaking generation from greenhouse gas causing, and water consuming fossil fuel generators. Such forecasting will enable development of pre-­&#8208; mitigation strategies instead of post mitigation using electrical storage systems. Prior studies indicate that this will result in the reduction by up to a factor of five, of the input/output requirements of the electrical storage system used in the pre-­&#8208;mitigation scenario, compared to the post mitigation scenario. These benefits will be seen with grid-­&#8208;tied, micro-­&#8208;grid and off-­&#8208;grid SPV systems. This opens commercial opportunities for introducing intelligent sensors and control systems to reduce bulk electrical storage. The technology areas used in this project include sensors, 3D printing, neural network based learning systems, embedded computers and cloud computing. The market sectors that will see a positive impact include all demographics as consumers, and manufacturers of SPV modules and SPV balance of system suppliers.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project  addresses  the  problem  of  mitigating cloud movement induced fluctuation in the output of SPV systems. The research objectives of Phase I are (a) prototype a whole sky imager that provides sufficient circumsolar image discrimination, to drive a neural network based learning system ? this will require  development  of  a  3D-­&#8208;printed  mounting system for a whole sky sensor, and interface to a cloud connected, local single board computer, (b) develop and optimize Image Acquisition, Compositing, Analysis, and Forecasting Algorithms to provide 15-­&#8208;500 second forecasts of Solar irradiance, and (c) deploy imager + software prototypes to evaluate real live sky imagery in multiple locations with different weather patterns, by gathering data to ?train? the neural network. It is anticipated that this evaluation and analysis of prototype performance will continue in subsequent phases, to obtain high confidence results. The anticipated results of the research in Phase I  are (i) refinement of the image capture system to produce ?good? imagery, (ii) development  of procedures  to  tune  neural  network  learning  system  towards  obtaining  high  confidence  forecasts, and (iii) understanding of performance requirements of local single board computer.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are block from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries have the ability to store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 30%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also have commercial upside with the potential to capture a $1.3 billion dollar market. Because of this, this project is expected to generate nearly 20 jobs and $79 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase 1 Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compresses by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). These membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size and size distribution, shape and network structure in order to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface chemistry modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (1 cm2) to commercial size (630 cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 30%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    This SBIR Phase I project involves the development of a turn-key simulation platform to automate electromagnetic design and modeling. This involves the integration of state-of-the-art open-source simulation engines with intelligent control software and cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC). Its three main benefits are to: (1) cut design time by at least 50%, (2) reduce operating costs by an order of magnitude via savings in labor and capital-equipment expenses, and (3) improve device performance, form factor, and energy efficiency by more than 10%. This tool enables the advanced manufacturing of new kinds of photonic and optoelectronic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, biomedicine, photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Its impact is to help propel US manufacturing competitiveness to the forefront of the $180B global photonics industry. This is the next generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools.


    Simpetus will develop an on-demand, pay-per-use, cloud-based photonics simulation platform, built on top of state-of-the-art open-source electromagnetic simulation engines, to automate the design and prototyping of a range of photonic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase I will involve developing a new Python application program interface (API), simulation templates for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), metamaterial split-ring resonators, and other common devices, as well as pre- and post-processing modules to enhance the productivity of our tools. This tool for research and development will be deployed on scalable, high-performance computing (HPC) in the public cloud. Work in Phase I will lay the groundwork for Phase II to develop the first turn-key simulation platform for advanced photonics manufacturing.

    The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the area of personalized and preventative medicine. The proposed work is aimed at bringing current laboratory-based blood/urine/saliva-tests, to the point-of-care, such as primary/urgent/emergency care facilities, community centers, and for some diseases, retirement homes, and self-testing. Current standard time-to-results, ranging from days or weeks, will be reduced to a few minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine physician visits resulting in early-diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and eventually reduced healthcare costs. This work will result in the development of a portable, low-powered, hand-held device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings, here in the US and internationally, thus supporting improved health management in these under-served communities. This unique technology has the potential to further improve the current standard of care by reliably and reproducibly detecting multiple diseases from the same few drops of blood in a few minutes. Although a single disease, liver cancer, is the initial target, future generations will target diseases ranging from cancers to viral and bacterial infections and can be expanded to environmental and veterinary applications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a proprietary multimodal approach (essentially lab-on-chip) that will translate the entire laboratory based diagnostic testing procedure to a rapid and disposable point of care test. The challenge lies in low sample volume availability (few drops), complex sample type (unprocessed whole-blood), short time-to-results and need for high accuracy and reliability. To address these stringent requirements, a platform technology based on a unique combination of label-free, very high frequency piezoelectric biochips, magnetic nanoparticles, and microfluidics is being developed. During this Phase I, key technology component designs and specifications that are required for the point-of-care detection of Alpha Fetoprotein with performance comparable to the current gold standard centralized laboratory method, i.e. ELISA, will be developed. At the end of this Phase I project, the critical designs of individual cartridge components will be fabricated and tested. These components will serve as critical inputs to the integrated prototyping to be performed in phase II that will result in a portable point of care diagnostic device.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves Web, Mobile and IoT applications, which
    generate significant economic value for society. IoT applications alone will add
    about $2T in economic value over the next 10 years. However, in order to fully
    realize the economic potential, high value applications will need to be created
    and brought to the market at low cost and quickly. This project will develop products
    that will significantly reduce development cost, improve quality, and bring these
    applications to market faster. The proposed project will also have significant
    impact on computer science education. Given the growing interest in programming
    at high school and college levels, the project will produce software tools and
    educational material that students can use to build novel applications without
    needing to learn a wide variety of languages and tools to experiment with different
    mobile and IoT devices. Further, interest in IoT has given rise to the maker movement,
    where low cost software and hardware tools are being used to build smart objects.
    Tools produced by this project will further lower the barrier of entry for the
    maker community. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
    the problem of developing IoT, Mobile and Web applications. Developing these applications
    is extremely challenging because of the differences in device capabilities, platform
    support (iOS vs. Android vs. Windows), and resources (memory, CPU, power). Building
    such applications often has meant rewriting a large percentage of the application
    code using different programming languages, tools, libraries and platform support.
    This has resulted in high development and management costs, inconsistent and poor
    product experience across platforms, and low software quality. This project addresses
    the problem by using a language-driven approach. In this approach, a new language
    is designed specifically to provide abstractions for the various forms of heterogeneity
    (including hardware, capability, resource and abstraction heterogeneities). Compilers
    and code generators use the semantic properties of the abstractions to generate
    code customized for each device. The Phase 1 project will develop tools and libraries
    for targeting the language for several mobile and IoT platforms. The outcome of
    Phase 1 will be a set of tools, which when given a program and a description of
    devices, will generate code for each device, distribute and install the binaries
    on each device, and manage the binaries for the devices."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to protect consumer privacy while continuing
    to enable the ad-supported Internet model. Current tracking-based consumer targeting
    approaches inherently erode consumer privacy, surreptitiously tracking users across
    many different web sites in an effort to gather demographic and behavioral data.
    On the flip side of the coin, marketers need to collect such data to successfully
    reach their audiences, and the revenue that marketers pour into advertising online
    has become an essential component of the economics of the internet. Today, this
    delicate balance of competing pros and cons is further threatened by the rise
    of ad-blocking software, which erodes the value of internet ad placement. The
    video marketing analytics capability developed in this project will limit marketers'
    need for invasive consumer data, while improving consumer experience. In the commercial
    realm, marketers would value the opportunity to target their ads in the most emotionally
    consonant, least disruptive, and most engaging manner possible. This technology
    will provide marketers with the capability to watch millions of videos algorithmically,
    thus enabling a more streamlined and customized viewer experience than has ever

    to generalize better to new, previously unseen images. While the company's technology

    a major technical drive in the proposed SBIR Phase I activities will be to shift
    the company's efforts to the analysis of \"live,\" enormous, and ever-expanding

    This SBIR Phase I project strives to reduce aircraft wire weight in order to improve aircraft range and reduce operating costs.  Commercial and military aerospace companies are heavily concerned with fuel costs associated with aircraft operation, as this expense contributes significantly to the total costs of the company.  Substantial reductions in aircraft weight could save millions of dollars per plane over its operating lifetime.  For example, eliminating a single pound from a military fighter aircraft can save up to $3,000 over its lifetime, as well as increase its operating range, capacity to carry a larger payload and extend its time-on-station capabilities.  These cost savings will benefit commercial aviation companies from decreased expense, resulting in a higher net income.  Enhanced financial performance promotes company growth and the creation of more jobs throughout all levels of the organization.  Increased income and job growth in this sector with stimulate continued national economic growth, providing benefit to the government via tax collections and increased commercial sector performance.  National defense and aerospace sectors would also benefit from fuel cost reductions reducing costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This project directly aligns with the NSF mission to progress science, advance national prosperity and secure the national defense.


    This project provides innovative contribution to wire development and manufacturing through the use of a carbon nanotube deposition process in order to produce shielding for wires. This process is versatile and can be used to produce cables with a commercial metal inner conductor or a carbon nanotube fiber bundle as inner conductor and a specific conductivity similar to tin. It combines high strength, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity with low density, which makes them ideal for applications where weight reduction is a priority, specifically in aerospace applications.  Until now, only minor reductions in wire weight have been achieved, through advances in composite connectors, thermoplastic cable clamps, downsizing connectors and using thinner wall insulation. The use of carbon nanotubes would remove the need for component removal due to decreased weight. The goal of this project is to prove out a continuous roll-to-roll wire coating process to produce carbon nanotube electromagnetic interference shields suitable for a large volume manufacturing operation. This will be accomplished through the use of foundationary methods of carbon nanotube deposition developed prior to this Phase I project. This project will produce the methods required for developing roll-to-roll continuous carbon nanotube wire coating.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to trigger a major shift toward mobile content across the marketing industry - broadening the market and generating larger economic impact. Massive amounts of media dollars are poised to shift toward mobile video, but will not flow freely until ads can be delivered on the right content (engaging and safe) to the right people (targeted consumer segments) at the right time (when consumers are actively engaged). This SBIR Phase I project will radically advance the scientific and technological understanding needed for marketers to deliver ads this way, thereby enabling them to build their brands with sight, sound, and motion content delivered surgically through the most personal and engaging channel available - mobile. With the project facilitating this transition: 1) brands will be able to advertise more efficiently across TV and mobile media; 2) content producers, now able to extract fair market value for their efforts, will be motivated to create more and better content; and 3) audiences will benefit from improved content quality, selection and accessibility.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to enable brands and agencies to quickly and efficiently extend TV media plans into the rapidly growing mobile video space. While marketers have sophisticated TV planning tools at their disposal, they currently lack the ability to integrate TV/mobile video advertising in a way that optimizes their audience engagement and media spend. The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop social media-based recommendation technology to help marketers plan mobile video ad campaigns that seamlessly integrate with their traditional TV campaigns. The proposed project will 1) validate the technical and commercial feasibility of this approach and 2) produce an alpha version of the technology. Anticipated technical results include: building and testing a video content discovery engine; validating and implementing a planning system; initiating UI testing and user studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in creating a market for financially sustained and accountable water services in developing countries. The impact of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene on public health is significant, and has the potential to prevent at least 9.1% of the global disease burden and 6.3% of all deaths. Present-day approaches for delivering water services in developing countries typically focus on deploying, maintaining, and monitoring aid-projects for only a few years. Impact is nominally evaluated by implementers (non-profit, private and government alike) directly. However, even when a positive impact is measured, the majority of these environmental service and monitoring interventions are short-term, and measurements may be misleading. For example, a multi-decade project apparently increased access to clean water supplies in rural areas from 58% in 1990 to 91% in 2015. Improved services may be realized through preventative and "just in time" maintenance activities, enabled through instrumentation and predictive failure data analysis algorithms. This may, critically, enable zero-interruption in water supply. Intermediate access to water, caused by water point failure, to clean water is known to increase health risks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to develop predicative machine learning algorithms for water point failures derived from cellular reporting electronic sensors installed on rural water infrastructure in developing countries. The innovation proposed for research in this proposal consists of employing an ensemble of robust machine learning classification techniques, using cross-validation methods to tune model parameters and evaluate performance, in order to develop a data-adaptive system capable of predicting failure well enough in advance to allow preventive maintenance, repair or replacement.  Specifically, we will first examine condition based maintenance. Condition based maintenance has several advantages over time based maintenance, especially the ability to allocate limited maintenance resources where they are needed, instead of spreading maintenance resources evenly, including where they may not be needed. Our proposed Phase 1 SBIR focuses on developing predictive algorithms for water point failures using our existing sensor hardware and applied to existing customers. Our success criteria for a Phase 1 SBIR is a predictive algorithm that can accurately identify water points in near-failure.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development
    of a novel, real-time biomedical sensing platform that can revolutionize personal
    health and clinical research. Chronic diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, etc.)
    are the leading causes of death and disability in US. Diabetes alone affects more
    than 29 million people in US, resulting in $245B annual health care cost. Disease
    management requires a long-term and reliable body metabolite monitoring system.
    The proposed wireless sensing technology will address this need by providing low-cost,
    minimally invasive, subdermal sensing of interstitial fluid (ISF) constituents
    using a novel mm-size integrated system utilizing scalable microelectronics fabrication
    technology. The proposed development effort will allow the use of this technology
    to wireless sensing applications in medical research (drugs/diseases) and connected
    or digital health. Currently, diabetes patients rely on painful and discrete fingerstick
    measurements or expensive (>$4k/year) and short-lived (7 days) transcutaneous
    devices for glucose monitoring. A low-cost (<$500/year), pain free, reliable and
    accurate glucose monitor will have a broad commercial impact by providing a solution
    suitable to a diverse set of patients as well as clinicians and researchers. The
    proposed project will result in a truly \"user-independent\" operation of implantable
    glucose sensors, rendering competitive market edge and job creation. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is intended to develop a wireless
    monolithic sensing platform that combines sensing, control, autonomous powering,
    and communication on a single mm-size microchip implant. The extremely small device
    size minimizes foreign body response and results in a stable sensor-tissue, allowing
    for much longer and stable operation compared to current devices. The device utilizes
    wireless operation using industry standard technologies, simplifying system development
    and integration. The sensor is fabricated on the semiconductor platform to form
    a fully integrated system and avoid expensive wiring and packaging. The scalable
    nature of the semiconductor technology enhances manufacturability, reduces unit
    cost in volume production, and ensures the availability of high volume manufacturing.
    Phase-I seeks to develop the integrated sensor solution in a needle-shape form
    and provide appropriate insertion/extraction device as a proof-of-concept to allow
    for a small-scale animal study to characterize the functionality of the system.
    It is also proposed to test the feasibility of achieving performance goals (in-vitro
    MARD, stable in-vivo operation longer than state-of-the-art CGM devices, determination
    of in-vivo MARD) using the proposed system. After successful feasibility phase,
    we will optimize the system performance and move to FDA IDE filing for clinical
    trials needed for commercialization, during Phase II."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce wearable personal comfort systems into the internet of things, reducing energy consumption in buildings while improving the comfort and well-being of building occupants. EMBR Labs? proprietary wearable technology generates real-time comfort data, enabling reduced and optimized HVAC loads, while simultaneously providing personalized comfort to occupants. Personal comfort systems have the potential to reduce building energy consumption by 20-40% and improve occupant productivity by 2-7%.  Providing this technology in commercial buildings could generate a return on investment in under 6 months while adding value for building occupants, facilities managers, and business owners. The R&D supported by this SBIR Phase I could save $B of dollars in energy costs, recapture over $20B of lost productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a personal comfort Internet of Things technology to resolve fundamental inefficiencies in the current approaches to maintaining the comfort and productivity of the American workforce in offices, hospitals, schools, and government buildings. The objectives of this project are to (i) demonstrate the technical feasibility of a wearable personal comfort system that is sufficiently ergonomic for adoption in the workplace, (ii) quantify the ability for the wearable technology to improve occupant comfort, and (iii) demonstrate the ability to collect real-time comfort data from the wearable personal comfort system. This SBIR Phase I project will culminate in the demonstration, validation, and quantification of wearable technology that provides real-time comfort data to smart buildings and personalized comfort to occupants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to them. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two key research objectives: scaling the technology to work for teams of size 10,000+, and determining the feasibility of porting the technology to mobile. A major scalability research area is search. The company envisions the technology to be the primary place where decisions are made, and hence a primary place where knowledge is stored, so fast, full-text search is important, despite the fact that chat generates much more traffic than email. One research area on mobile is the HCI challenge of displaying rich options for conversation navigation on a small mobile screen. The problem is unique to this technology, since having long running, asynchronous conversations means that users do not typically read messages in a strictly chronological fashion. The company anticipates the Phase I grant will enable it to develop a working solution to the search scalability problem, and a working prototype of a performant and productive mobile user experience.

    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture
    allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly
    to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced
    image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning
    accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal
    growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts
    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast
    phantom."

    and Accessible Breast Imaging'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.

    The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.

    This SBIR Phase II project deals with the development of a gamified educational platform meant to excite and inspire children to learn about the sciences through the medium of cooking. By engaging students with interactive content in K-8 classrooms, after school programs, and special education settings, the proposed innovation aims to simultaneously accomplish three outcomes that are important to K-8 students' education and healthy living. These outcomes include: (1) helping students develop a highly practical skill (cooking), (2) generating excitement about and enhancing learning in several scientific disciplines (particularly nutrition science, STEM, and human geography), and (3) promoting a highly desirable behavior in students (the development of healthy eating habits). This project proposes to develop a prototype version of the innovative educational technology. It builds upon an existing proof-of-concept application that integrates nutrition science (in the form of cooking recipes) with human geography (different countries and cultures) and significantly enhances this application by innovatively linking the cooking-related content to a STEM curriculum and testing the addition of a variety of capabilities meant to increase user engagement and learning through the application. This Phase I proposal will research the feasibility and usability of the product, and investigate the extent to which the proposed technology is able to simultaneously achieve the three stated outcomes in a way that outperforms traditional paper-based school curricula. With the market for mobile learning products valued at $12.2 billion, the company's three-pronged approach to improving learning and health-related outcomes for K-8 students stands to generate significant revenue. The team estimates that the business can reach roughly 2 million in sales in the first three years following the product?s launch.

    The proposed research will explore (1) various ways for the system to automatically link cooking concepts with STEM concepts in a way that enhances learning and engagement and produces a curriculum compliant with Next Generation Science Standards, (2) the application of emotional intelligence to data gathered, such that the technology will track students? mood and food choices, and provide suggestions based on an optimal match between the two, and (3) the use of adaptive learning to effectively deliver the above curriculum in a targeted and personalized manner (including accommodations for children with special needs during Phase II). These outcomes will be achieved by creating and testing new capabilities for the system, including the ability to monitor user performance, a points-based progression system, personalization, customized STEM games, and matching students with recipes and lesson plans based on their culinary preferences and emotional moods, the majority of which will be implemented via the use of machine learning. Overall, the goal of the small business is to develop several different app features that incorporate the above-mentioned approaches, and to determine, through repeated and rigorous classroom testing with K-8 students, which combination of features maximizes the learning and behavioral outcomes that the application is targeting.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to design, build, test, and refine a cartridge of medicine for use with an inkjet printer for printing medicine that was developed with past NSF ERC support for academic research and I-Corps support for market research. Similar to how a conventional inkjet printer deposits small quantities of liquid ink on blank paper, the printer deposits precisely measured quantities of medicine on blank carriers to make the final pharmaceutical product. Due to its smaller size and relatively quick production times, the printer enables and is currently aimed at personalized medicine applications, wherein dosages and other product factors are customized to individual named patients by their medical practitioner and drug products are made for the patient to suit based on such a patient-specific prescription. The detailed development of medicine cartridges has not been attempted before, and is specifically pursued in this SBIR Phase I project to demonstrate cleanliness, address potential counterfeiting concerns, provide ease of use, and provide tracking if required. Such cartridges are envisioned to enhance the impact of printed medicine for personalized medicine applications, thereby improving the level of healthcare for this nation?s ill and creating a high-value just-in-time pharmaceutical production market.

    It is technologically very challenging to adapt the cartridge concept to pharmaceutical applications. These challenges include: the need for the cartridge to maintain cleanliness and integrity during storage and in use; the need to ensure that final products match required composition and dissolution profiles; the need to ensure that the contents of a cartridge are shelf-stable over its life; the prevention of any accidental introduction of impurities or deliberate counterfeiting; and the need to preclude operator error in wrong-substance or wrong-dose dispensing. Further challenges include the need to select and optimize cartridge size and form factors. Preliminary designs for cartridges have been identified, and this SBIR Phase I support will enable such designs to be built, tested and improved. Such cartridges will be filled with both inert materials and with certain specific drug substances identified as being of commercial interest. The cartridge and printer are planned to recognize each other to prevent operator transcription error. Testing for composition and impurities is planned with standard analytical chemistry techniques used in the pharmaceutical sector, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry. The end result is a robust and reliable cartridge, to transform personalized medicine for the better for everyone.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application,
    to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular
    resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks
    are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically,
    elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what
    is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks
    often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate
    mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop
    and test a personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support.
    The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science
    comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce
    content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards on Global
    Climate Change. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge
    more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the general public. Given
    these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM
    professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry. \n\n\nThis project
    will produce an innovative iOS reading app to support science learning.  The key
    innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners.
    This Phase I project has five technical goals: (a) create NGSS-aligned content;
    (b) write and test assessments using item response theory; (c) develop and test
    the back-end for the app, to include cloud-based SQL databases, content delivery
    network, and the application programming interface; (d) develop and test&#8232;the
    front-end for the app, to include the user interface design and the model view
    controller architecture; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers to
    evaluate the usabilityand initial feasibility of SquidBooks. During Phase I, the
    SquidBooks team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation
    to market. The key features of the iOS app create a potential for unnecessary
    memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the
    program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is making scientific
    content more readable and accessible. This requires a balance between using precise
    scientific language and common language, while maintaining core scientific ideas."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be to develop an effective new mosquito control product that works against both adult and immature vectors, drastically reducing the size of the vector population without reliance on conventional insecticides. It will consist of two components: a potent plant-derived attractant to lure adult vector mosquitoes and an insect development disruptor that locks larvae in a permanent state of immaturity, eventually resulting in death, and also renders exposed adults infertile. This product will reduce the impacts of mosquito-borne illnesses around the world, and reduce environmental contamination by cover sprays of hazardous conventional pesticides. This strategy could revolutionize area-wide mosquito control programs: by inducing a large proportion of mosquitoes within the target population to act as their own delivery mechanism for the control agent, the proposed product substantially increases the effective size of the treated area, making it operationally viable to effectively treat every larval habitat and adult resting site, even in urban areas with an overwhelming abundance of potential habitats. Because this product attracts and contaminates all key species of mosquitoes, it will become an invaluable tool for the $16B/yr global vector control market.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I project are designed to demonstrate feasibility of an auto-dissemination strategy to control mosquito populations via three mechanisms: 1) exposure to the formulation containing the disruptor sterilizes adults; 2) larval breeding sites contaminated by the disruptor during adult visits will produce no viable offspring; and 3) the disruptor passed between adults during interactions (mating) increases the proportion of sterile individuals in the population and unproductive larval habitats in the treated area. By manipulating mosquitoes to deliver the control agent to their own offspring and restricting the reproductive capacity of the adult population, this project will help to overcome the long historical prejudice in favor of adult-targeting chemical insecticides by demonstrating that larval-targeted measures can be used to suppress vector populations at reasonable cost, renewing scientific and commercial interest in such alternative strategies. To demonstrate feasibility of this approach, Phase I research will focus on evaluating the effects of the formulation on vector mosquitoes when exposure occurs through contact and/or ingestion; determining the capacity of female mosquitoes to deliver the formulation to larval habitats; and finally, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed auto-dissemination strategy in reducing vector populations in an endemic field setting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the expansion of the range of applications of safe, selective, and effective ribonuclic acid interference (RNAi) triggers for use as pesticides. If successful, this biotechnology will contribute to sustainable food production and enhance biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective pesticides associated with human health costs and harmful impacts to non-target flora and fauna.  The intended first product resulting from this project will be an insecticide to control fire ants.  It is estimated that fire ants cause $7 billion in damages in the U.S. annually.  There are number of products on the market that control fire ants, but few that customers are confident are environmentally benign and completely safe to humans and pets.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize topical RNAi-based pesticides. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, few pests are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to 1) RNAi efficacy 2) cost of RNAi triggers. The outcomes of the proposed research would enable 1) lower the cost of topical RNAi-based pesticides by at least four-fold, 2) extend the range of the target insects, and 3) target Solenopsis Invicta Buren (Red Imported Fire Ant, RIFA). Once effective RNAi triggers have been identified, the process will be scaled up for the Phase II proposal. During Phase II, reaction conditions will be optimized at pilot scale to demonstrate the technology's value for production of RNAi triggers needed for field tests on RIFA.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop an improved permanent magnet that will allow cost reduction and/or vehicle weight reduction in automotive applications. This permanent magnet product will be fabricated from samarium cobalt magnetic particles that are encapsulated with a nanometer scale coating of iron or cobalt metal. Bonded permanent magnets manufactured using these nanostructured powders will have energy products at least 30% greater than samarium cobalt alone. This increase in performance means that the same motor can use 20% less magnetic material resulting in cost savings, weight savings, and reduction in the use of the critical rare earth element samarium. In addition, compact high-performance permanent magnets will help the United States reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emission with no adverse effect on vehicle performance.

    The technical objective in this Phase I research project is to validate the feasibility of achieving a high energy product nanostructured permanent magnet powder by coating commercially available samarium cobalt particles with nanometer-scale shells of iron or cobalt. Nanostructured permanent magnet powders, comprised of micron-size hard magnetic core particles surrounded by nanometer-scale soft magnetic shells, show promise as a replacement for high energy product rare earth permanent magnets. Commercial production of these materials, however, has proved problematic due to the difficulty of handling and coating ultrafine powders while maintaining clean core-shell interfaces. In this Phase I project, magnetic nanostructured powders will be fabricated using powder encapsulation technology has been shown to enable the production of nanometer-scale metallic shell layers on micron-sized metallic core particles in an ultra-clean atmosphere controlled environment. Using these powders, proof-of-concept bonded permanent magnets will be manufactured and evaluated for potential use in simple motors that utilize bonded samarium cobalt or neodymium iron boron magnets. High performance magnetic core-shell powders produced with this particle encapsulation technology will demonstrate the possibility of achieving reduced rare-earth-content high energy product permanent magnets and lay the foundation for commercial-scale production of these materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is two-pronged: removal of metal  contaminants in wastewater to limit regulatory/environmental costs and recovery of economically valuable metals. Water metal contamination is a ubiquitous problem due to the many industrialized processes that drive our economy. Examples include mining drainage, metal plating, semiconductor fabrication, and solar cell production. These examples straddle well-established and emerging industries but each pose significant environmental impact due to metal contamination potential. Furthermore, the loss of the associated metals carries an economic consequence as un-recovered material represents a significant missed opportunity in raw material utilization. The proposed technology in this Phase I project is poised to address these concerns.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to produce a novel metal binding compound and to scale-up the water-metal removal prototypes based upon this compound. The project will develop a production system for producing a small molecule natural product capable of binding metal compounds with high affinity. This compound will be bound to a solid matrix which enables a heterogeneous means of removing metal content from contaminated water samples. Existing small-scale production and water treatment prototypes will be subjected to cellular and process engineering to scale up for water treatment applications. This scaling step is considered crucial to establishing the viability of the overall technology and approach. Metabolic engineering strategies will be utilized to improve cellular production of the metal binding compound. Process engineering will be applied to scale production of the compound and to assess subsequent packed-bed column operations designed to continuously remove metals from water samples. The team will work closely with a local metal plating company to demonstrate the technology with field wastewater samples. Success will result in a scaled prototype for extended application across industries facing metal contamination/loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is the development of a process for the sustainable production of high value chemicals (HVCs) from non-food biomass. The resulting HVCs, isoeugenol and ferulate, are the starting materials used in the flavor and fragrance industry for the manufacture of natural vanillin. Today, only a small percentage of the 18,000 metric tons of vanillin used annually is produced from natural sources. The clear majority of vanillin is produced by harsh chemical derivatization of petroleum feedstock. Using the innovative technology developed by Spero Energy, Inc., non-food biomass can be used to produce the starting materials for natural vanillin production. Sustainable manufacturing of natural isoeugenol and ferulate from non-food biomass will serve to advance the US bioeconomy while supplying essential starting materials to the $600 million a year and growing vanillin industry.

    The technical objectives of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to demonstrate the scalability of Spero?s technology for production of natural isoeugenol and ferulate from non-food biomass. Increasing consumer demand for products containing natural flavors and fragrances, and the associated premium prices relative to artificial alternatives, offers a promising venue to advance the US bioeconomy. Spero Energy, Inc. has developed natural and sustainable methods to produce isoeugenol and ferulate, key starting materials for the synthesis of natural vanillin. Vanillin is one of the most widely utilized flavors with a market value of over $600 million per year. Key research objectives include scaling production volumes of ferulate and isoeugenol, followed by a detailed study of purification methods, biochemical conversion to natural vanillin, and validation of the organoleptic properties of the resulting vanillin. This work is anticipated to yield key reaction and purification data which will be analyzed with ASPEN modeling in preparation for pilot scale production in Phase II.

    Research Phase I project is the potential to impact water scarcity in arid and
    semi-arid geographies within the US and beyond.  The proposed photobiological
    water treatment process  utilizes the natural power of photosynthetic microorganisms
    (diatoms) and sunlight without the use of hazardous chemicals or non-renewable
    energy to remove contaminants such as silica, calcium, iron, manganese, phosphorus
    and nitrogen from the concentrated waste streams (brines) from advanced water
    reclamation and brackish groundwater desalination facilities.  Additional clean,
    (re)usable water can be obtained from the treated brine quite cost-effectively,
    while reducing the volume of brine by >50% and producing algal biomass as a marketable
    by-product.  This technology will reduce the environmental impact and also potentially
    improve the efficiency of water treatment.  This Phase I project will have broader
    impacts on the advancement of science and technology related to environmental
    microbiology, water reuse and water resource management.  The experimental data
    to be generated in this project could reveal many characteristics and fundamental
    chemistry and biology of brackish water diatoms that have not been studied in
    detail, as compared with those found in the freshwater and marine environment.
    \ \n\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to investigate
    the feasibility of a diatom-based photobiological process for scalant and nutrient
    removal to recover more fresh water from reverse osmosis concentrate;  to characterize
    the byproducts of this process including organic matter and algal biomass;  and
    to investigate the scale-up challenges.  The challenges and opportunities include:
    (1) the optimization of the biomass growth and constituent removal, including
    diatom strain screening, (2) impacts of toxic elements, chlorine residuals, salinity,
    pH, temperature, light sources, intensity, and duration, (3) formation and characterization
    of byproducts, (4) removal of synthetic organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals
    and personal care products, (5) photobiological reactor configuration and hydraulics,
    and (6) possible uses and economic values of algal biomass.  Among them, the major
    challenges are the possible soluble organic byproduct formation and the relatively
    modest silica uptake rate.  Bench- and pilot-scale experiments will be conducted
    to optimize the photobiological process to enable a full-scale application with
    a reasonable footprint.  Careful diatom strain/species selection and more detailed
    chemical and biochemical analyses will also facilitate further process optimization
    and understanding of the fate of byproducts, their impacts on subsequent desalination,
    and possible control strategies."

    This SBIR Phase I project is to develop and demonstrate novel nanotechnology based flow battery that meets demanding 2020 energy density targets for transportation and stationary storage and offers a cheaper, safer and environmentally friendly rechargeable energy-storing fluid, which could ultimately allow using batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in the same fashion as gasoline-powered engines. The proposed innovative approach uses advancements in nanotechnology to merge solid battery chemistries into a convenient flowable format (nanoelectrofuels or NEF). The low cost and high energy density of the proposed flow batteries (up to 350 Wh/L) makes this technology highly competitive with currently used Li-ion batteries (250 Wh/L), while the flowable format enables charging the liquid in one device and use of energy in a separate device, offering new refueling opportunities for EV operations, specifically addressing range anxiety and long charging time - issues currently preventing widespread adoption of EVs. From the commercial perspective the successful development of the proposed low cost high energy density aqueous flow battery could be transformational for electrification of personal and commercial transportation, grid leveling, and integration of renewable energy sources into our individual energy usage for a climate-friendly, environmentally and economically sustainable future.


    In this project novel low-cost, high energy density rechargeable liquids that feature active energy storing materials in pumpable low viscosity aqueous nanosuspension (NEF) will be demonstrated in a full flow cell reactor (Phase I). The challenge of achieving electroactive suspensions with high solid loading and low viscosity is addressed by changing the surface chemistry of nanoparticles and based on the patented surface modification approach which enables high dispersibility of nanoparticles in fluids and their ability to more efficiently transport and store electrical energy. Innovation in flow cell designs are also proposed for effective battery operations with this new energy storage format. Demonstration of this technology in a full flow cell will significantly de-risk further commercialization efforts for this transformational technology and will enable highly versatile, interchangeable and rechargeable liquids for electrical energy storage solutions. The main outcome of this project (Phase II) will be the prototype of NEF flow battery with design geared towards the first market - light electric utility vehicles (EUVs, $1.3 B market in US) that currently use Pb-acid batteries. For the same volume and 25% lower price per kWh the NEF battery offers ~3 times the energy storage and the additional ability of rapid charge replenishment through active material (NEF) replacement.

    Pre-K and Kindergarten students by providing support for neuro-cognitive skills,
    such as executive functioning and reasoning, shown to be critical for school success.
    The first aim is to build a prototype of a game-based assessment tool for these
    skills that can be implemented in classrooms to measure these skills as a baseline
    and to track and measure progress over time. If proven feasible, the prototype
    is expected to assess a child's skills in five neuro-cognitive areas in 10-15
    minutes with minimal adult intervention and provide recommendations for further
    support. Phase I of this project will focus on developing the prototype, testing
    usability and feasibility with Pre-K students and teachers, and collecting data
    to calibrate the tool using factor analysis and item-response theory. The broader
    impact of this research is to gather rich data that will advance the scientific
    community's understanding of cognitive development in relation to multiple factors
    and to increase the ability to evaluate the impact of targeted interventions.
    In addition, commercialization of the proposed tool will help increase teachers'
    and caregivers' awareness of these skills and shift classroom practices towards
    fostering the critical underlying skills for school readiness. \n\nThis project
    will build a prototype using constructs that are based on neuropsychological tasks
    designed to target these skills in lab research. Five skills will be included
    in the prototype: working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, reasoning
    and spatial skills. First, results from a convergent reliability study fielded
    in spring 2016 comparing Pre-K students' performance in these constructs vs. normed
    reference tests will be used to refine and improve the reliability of the constructs.
    Next, the prototype will undergo usability and feasibility testing with Pre-K
    students and teachers. The goal is to optimize the experience such that it can
    be completed in a single 15-minute session with minimal adult intervention. Finally,
    data will be gathered to calibrate the tool using factor analysis and item-response
    theory to refine the test branching algorithms. At the end of Phase I, the prototype
    will be ready for further research to normalize the results nationally."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project comes from addressing a demand in many parts of the world for a scalable technological solution for managers of nature resources to deal with human-animal conflicts and rapid deforestation. Natural resources have large and sometimes surprising ecosystem impact. Even the direct economic value of individual wildlife and forest reserves is often in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Operationally relevant protection technologies that are sustainable can serve as an import tool in effective management. Having a low total cost of ownership and effectively co-existing with conventional human surveillance methods is key to sustainability. We seek to commercialize a protection system that is sustainable as it offers low cost, long lived devices, ease of use and maintenance, robust performance across diverse natural environments, and stealthy operation. It also augments accountability of the guards, and automates tasks such as notifying management and sharing forensic evidence of incidents in settings where communication infrastructure is not readily available.

    The proposed project addresses the challenge with reducing energy consumption for our battery powered, radar device based, mesh network solution for persistent, time-sensitive protection of natural resources. Commercial impact for the proposed system can only be realized if the sensor is low-power, the data driven machine learning based signal processing is low-power, and the wide area networking is low-power. Addressing all these will unlock commercial value, but the impact is limited by the least efficient part of the system. Today the radar's efficiency is the essential bottleneck in system performance; it consumes about 40 milliWatts (mW). Reducing the radar's consumption to 5mW would double, and reducing it to 1mW would at least triple, the time between battery changes. The proposed effort would design, implement, and validate power reduction in the radar subsystem and integrate the result into an overall system. The largest technical risk in the plan is the Radio Frequency subsystem, which will therefore be addressed in Phase I. Phase II will implement power reductions in all the other radar subsystems, integrate the results into a coherent sensor, and integrate that sensor into the overall system. This integration into the larger system will also deal with whole system optimizations.

    This SBIR Phase I project provides student access to computer science curriculum and computational thinking skills to better prepare for college and the workforce. Unfortunately, no organized computer science curriculum is offered in majority of schools in the United States and only 1 out of 4 public high schools in the United States offer even one computer science class.  Educators and administrators need new platforms of community and technical support to overcome these modern challenges and accomplish these critical goals. This project is aimed at the design and development of a web-based software platform to enable educators to confidently teach computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education in classrooms and community centers. The resulting software platform would enable rapid growth of after-school clubs, camps, evening classes, in-school field trips, workshops, and educational gaming. This effort further democratizes the teaching of computer science and engineering concepts, thus addressing the talent gap that is leaving the United States behind in cybersecurity and in the world economy. This project has significant revenue and growth potential as it can be of service to approximately 3 million public school teachers and 50.1 million students who attended public elementary and secondary schools in 2015.

    This project will design and develop a web-based software platform to easily connect, attract, and foster the exchange, co-creation, and delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. Analytics and metrics will be applied and developed to gain insight into the support needed for effective instruction. Instructors will be able to develop rich, dynamic, and engaging content, allowing secondary and elementary students to actively participate with the material and to assess their understanding. Students using the platform will also get access to expert mentors for debugging help, code review, and to ask questions. Educators will able to communicate best practices to ensure continuous access to high quality computer literacy resources. As a result, the platform provides superior pedagogy for secondary and elementary school students learning computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity.  An initial alpha launch, a pilot study and analytical data gathering will be conducted throughout Phase 1 to study the efficacy of the proposed solution. The goal of this research is to verify the system features, the ease of use and to understand if Phase 1 activities result in a prototype that offers technical feasibility to solve the problem.

    fabrication of X-ray focusing devices for high photon energies in the range from
    10 keV to >100 keV, necessary for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and
    structural analyses of materials in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable
    today. Their primary use is in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in
    X-ray microscopes with X-ray tubes sources in specialized industrial and research
    environments. They form a special class of high-value consumables, with a functional
    life time of ~2.5 years, with capabilities to address the global market segment
    worth about $1M today for low and average performance diffractive focusing devices,
    to more than $4M, if the unprecedented performance devices will be developed.
    Availability of such focusing devices will enhance the scientific understanding
    of structure of matter at the nano-scale and the interplay of structure and functionality
    for applications ranging from drugs development to materials science, nano-electronics,
    biosciences, forensics, battery and energy research, investigating terrestrial
    soils or cosmic dust, the kinetics of ultra-fast chemical reactions, advanced
    catalysts, and others. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is twofold.
    First, the innovative method of fabrication is a combination of top-down and bottom-up
    processing. It includes the atomic layer deposition onto batch-fabricated cylindrical
    silicon precursors of sequences of low and high absorption and refractive index
    materials, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers
    according to the Fresnel zone rules, followed by polishing the wafer to form membranes
    with focusing devices embedded into them. Hundreds of zone plates can be produced
    on one wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the method is
    extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which
    enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index kinoforms ? devices with single
    foci and of ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I will address these issues
    by effectively assessing the capabilities for individual key processes and will
    prove the fabrication feasibility, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication
    and testing of prototypes with long runs of atomic layer deposition processes,
    as necessary for functional devices."

    This Phase I SBIR project is directed at developing  a portable, sensitive, and affordable device to detect M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum samples and simultaneously determine the multidrug resistance profile of the pathogen, all within 3 days of sputum collection (It takes more than 6 weeks using current technology).   By significantly reducing the time to detect viable Mtb and obtain its drug resistance profile in patient specimens, the device being developed promises to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public-health challenges in the world today, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2013. More alarmingly, the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is rapidly increasing, especially in low resource environments.  Being able to detect the presence of low loads of mycobacteria and gaining knowledge about the drug resistance profile of a particular isolate in 3 days will be a game changer in global community?s efforts to combat the spread of TB (esp. MDR TB). It will lead to better outcomes for patients (less mortality, quicker recovery), and also better public health (less transmission to others and less fostering of drug resistance in populations).

    The device being developed incorporates two key technologies that enable it to achieve rapid detection and drug-resistance profiling: (1) super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalized with moieties that bind to bacterial cells, and (2) microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) that is able to detect in real time the growth or death of cells in suspension.  The proposed approach involves (a) using MNPs to collect the ~1000 Mtb cells present in 2-10ml of sputum sample into a small (200ul) of growth medium during the standard decontamination process (b) dispensing the 200ul suspension into 16 microwells, each containing different formulations of freeze-dried growth-media and/or drugs of interest (c) monitoring the cells in each well m-EIS.  The pre-concentration will take <1 hour, and the monitoring of death/growth/stasis will take 3 days. In Phase I, the team will (1) verify the efficacy of the pre-concentration technique,  (2) establish the ability of the m-EIS method to record in real time the death, proliferation, or statis of mycobacteria, and (3) design a prototype cassette containing 16 wells, and fabricating it using 3D-printing (stereolithography).  In addition, a detailed design (electrical, mechanical and fluidic) of the automated system (disposables and nondisposable hardware) to be built in Phase II will be completed, and other applications of the core approach explored.

    This SBIR Phase I project is proposing the development of a new electrochemical method for the manufacture of chemicals of interest to pharmaceutical, agricultural and fine chemical producers. New chemical manufacturing technologies are needed to reduce the environmental costs and the risk posed by traditional chemical manufacturing technologies. Flow technology is reducing the hazard, environmental impact and cost of drug manufacture while at the same time providing an improved product. This project will develop new chemistries designed to operate using flow technology. The development of such new reactions is necessary to realize the full benefit of flow technology. Further, new equipment for the research laboratory is also necessary to speed the development of this advanced manufacturing technology. NSF investment in the development of advance manufacturing technology like this SBIR Phase I project will have widespread impact on the US economy. The technology promises to lower the cost of producing medicines and materials. The point-of-use production of chemicals enabled by this proposal has the potential to eliminate the need to ship, store and handles hazardous materials. The development of advanced chemical manufacturing technologies such as this project will be a strategic advantage to US manufacturers enabling the creation of new high value molecules using the highly efficient technologies such as this project.


    This SBIR Phase I project is aimed at the development of an electrochemically-mediated reaction using flow chemistry as practical, safe and sustainable means of replacing hazardous and environmentally damaging catalysts and reagents in the manufacture of high-value chemicals and materials. Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are of critical importance to the commercial production of medicines and materials. These reactions typically use of highly reactive organometallic reactants in combination with precious metal catalysis to form the bond. This SBIR project is aimed at developing an electrochemical sp2-sp3 bond forming reaction. The project will use the Kolbe electrolysis reaction to generate sp3 radicals which will react with an aryl or vinyl halide in the presence of a nickel catalyst used to activate a sp2-halide bond. Electricity will be used to both oxidize the carboxylates and reduce the nickel catalyst in an electrochemical flow-cell. Developed as a flow process, this method will be readily applicable to commercial scale production. To facilitate development of the reaction the project will also develop an optimal lab-scale electrochemical flow cell. The project goal is to both develop both a more efficient method for sp2-sp3 bond forming and also develop appropriate lab tools to enable other researchers to easily adopt and use the new reaction types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a technology for remediating contaminated  water.  These  new  materials that called controlled release polymer structures  (CRPS) are being developed for In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO). ISCO is an advanced remediation technology that has proven efficacy in reducing groundwater pollution. There are currently 1,322 sites on the EPA's National Priorities List where hazardous contaminants have or are expected to be released into the environment. CRPS serves this large $60 billion market with a low-cost, flexible remediation material. This proprietary technology offsets growing water scarcity and aging infrastructure that leads to compromised water sources. Current ISCO methods require using hazardous liquid oxidizers that pose significant worker safety risk and are not effective in all environments. CRPS can be delivered as a solid designed to treat specific contaminated zones over the course of months to years. It is expected that CRPS can transform the remediation industry by: 1) ensuring worker safety, 2) reducing labor costs, 3) allowing sustained, long  term treatment decreasing  redeployment cost, 3) providing  tunability  to  meet specific site characteristics or toxins, and 4) allowing ISCO to be a more attractive remediation approach due to increased ease of use.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to  support  scale-up  manufacturing  and efficacy testing in preparation for field-testing at a contaminated groundwater  site.  This  program  will develop and optimize material formulation including active ingredient loading, stability, and handling / transport for commercial use. Likewise, methods amendable to large-scale manufacturing will be investigated as well as performance testing in dynamic flow contaminated water studies. Work  will investigate the ability of CRPS to be tuned for controlled release rates under multiple environmental simulations to determine contaminant degradation such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). MTBE is used as a fuel additive and is a common groundwater  contaminant  that  results  from  leaking  underground storage tanks. MTBE is particularly problematic due to its solubility and mobility in water as well as environmental persistence. Contaminant degradation by CRPS will be tested  over  a  range  of concentrations to yield dose response curves. Collectively, this Phase I program will result in a clear understanding of CRPS performance guiding future pilot scale field studies. Cost  and  deployment strategies of the CRPS compared to current ISCO remediation technologies will be evaluated in preparation for commercialization

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to understand how conductivity in the brain is affected by anatomical variability between patients and, more importantly, to enable precise treatment of neurological diseases using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques. A number of studies have shown these techniques may be used, cost-effectively, to improve learning, working memory, as well as relieve chronic pain and the symptoms of depression, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia. However, current understanding of electromagnetic (EM) characteristics for the human head and state-of-the-art TMS and tDCS techniques suffer from the inability to precisely control the most appropriate excitation pathways in the brain to support a specified clinical objective. This can result in unexpected and sometimes ineffective or even detrimental outcomes. Models and TMS/tDCS treatment systems for implementation of excitation techniques are not validated to standards.  A thorough understanding of pathways and development of validated mimics and phantom structures will enable development and clinical implementation of precisely controlled analytical models and protocols for effective, widely accessible, reliable and safe TMS/tDCS treatments.

    The proposed project will address gaps in current knowledge of intracranial electromagnetic characteristics and materials performance to develop reproducible head phantoms for clinical implementation of more precise, quantifiable tDCS and TMS techniques. This research will characterize solid, liquid and gel materials selected to comply with biomedical and commercialization criteria. Analyses will be used to develop formulations of combinations of materials that address the range of conductivity and anisotropy of the parts and interfaces of the human brain. These formulations will be experimentally evaluated and refined for producibility and accuracy.  This will provide a database of materials solutions which will be used in Phase II and beyond.  Traditional brain conductivity mimics are simple spherical shells consisting of a single agar based conductivity mimic, which lacks the complexity of the human brain. The challenges of developing an EM brain phantom include fabrication of the various materials for controlled and reproducible anisotropic conductivity values, shaping these materials to mimic anatomical features, and combining them to represent boundary interfaces and control gaps for accurate pathway performance. The proposed effort includes development of a shell mimic that incorporates applicable material formulations to validate extensibility to more sophisticated prototype phantoms during Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the ability of forensic scientists to capture, analyze, and search fingerprint impression evidence in the field. Additionally, a contactless device will eliminate the potential for alteration, loss of detail, or destruction of the fingerprint impression. This system will also have a positive impact on law enforcement agencies by accelerating fingerprint recovery, improving the quality of fingerprint impression evidence collected at crime scenes, reducing training requirements, and accelerating investigations. Furthermore, this project will address numerous concerns and recommendations regarding fingerprints and forensics published in the National Research Council's (NRC) 2009 Report, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel device capable of digitally acquiring the various types of fingerprint impressions found at crime scenes - latent, patent, and plastic. Fingerprints represent one of the most important and fragile types of evidence. However, manually processing crime scenes for fingerprint impressions requires trained technicians, a variety of supplies, and a significant amount of time. Once visualized and processed, fingerprint impressions must undergo a multitude of steps in order to be digitized for searching against databases of exemplar fingerprint records. The goal of Phase I is to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of utilizing a contactless, three-dimensional (3D) scanning device to acquire different types of fingerprint impressions deposited on a variety of surfaces and convert them into two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints that are consistent and compatible with existing fingerprint databases and matching algorithms. To achieve these goals, the research team will build a prototype 3D scanner, develop new unrolling and segmentation algorithms, and test the ability to match recovered fingerprints against a database of exemplar fingerprint records.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this small business innovative research (SBIR) Phase I Project is the further commercialization of the highly efficient and unique technology organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). This panel technology has the potential to strongly impact the automotive industry by replacing the current tail light technology. The benefits offered by OLED taillights include low cost manufacturing, space and weight saving, reduction in material consumption, energy efficiency, and freedom of form factors for design.  The broader impacts of this technology coming to the commercial market are, reduced environment impact in the automotive industry and the furthering of OLED panel technology. This innovation offers a future potential to be used in residential general-purpose lighting. The demonstration and adoption of this technology in the lighting market can lead to a large national or global reduction in energy demand.

    This Small Business innovation research (SBIR) Phase I Project contains intellectual merit across chemistry, materials science, optics, semiconductor physics, and device engineering. In their initial phases traditional light emitting diodes (LEDs) were very efficient and converting energy into light, but it was a very difficult task to extract the light from the device for illumination. Once this problem was solved LEDs took on the well-known dome shape and immediately gained commercial traction. Currently organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer a similar issue. OLEDs are very efficient at converting energy into light; however, much of the light is trapped within the device and is unable to be used for illumination. The research targets this issue with microcavity structures in hopes of creating a solution to OLEDs, allowing them to become widely available in the commercial market.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project relate to the increased viability of indigo as an agricultural crop competing with synthetically manufactured indigo dye.  Indigo was among the major global cash crops of the 18th and 19th centuries and accounted for 100% of the indigo dye consumed in the world.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, nearly 100% of the indigo dye consumed in the world has been synthetically manufactured from petroleum derivatives and hazardous and toxic chemicals.  A small amount of plant-derived indigo dye is produced throughout the world using traditional artisan methods largely unchanged for centuries, but this supply is highly variable in purity and consistency and is far from cost competitive with synthetically manufactured indigo dye.  Stony Creek Colors in cooperation with the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center seeks through this project to improve the available indigo planting stock by creating a high-throughput handheld assay device capable of rapid measurements of the chemical precursors for indigo which exist naturally in the plant leaves.  During this process the team will also improve the understanding of the genetics of the existing indigo planting stock through DNA analysis of specific high-yielding plant varieties.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop new tools, both genomic and phenomic, for analyzing the indigo crop Persicaria tinctoria, to produce an improved bio-based specialty chemical derived from renewable, abundant plant-material. The STTR project will map existing genetic resources while developing a unique approach for plant indican (indigo precursor) analysis which will enable non-destructive analysis of plant leaves in breeding lines.  Finally, a genetic mapping population between high and low indican-producing parent plants will be constructed for analysis and laboratory validation.  Successful completion of the Phase I tasks tied to these objectives will prove the feasibility of selecting and maintaining high indigotin yielding strains of P. tinctoria.  These improvements will be commercialized through higher indigotin yielding breeders seed stock and will be spread to over 26,000 acres of cropland in the Southeast US within 6 years, resulting in a more reliable and cost-competitive bio-based indigo dye extracted from U.S. grown plant material.  This will allow plant-derived indigo to be more cost-competitive with synthetic indigo dye and to meet the immediate market demand for U.S. bio-based indigo by denim mills.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to reduce the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. Its patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations based on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if you captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is based on a proof-of-concept demonstrating that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, the project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military applications that would help secure the national defense.

    The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) alpha device. A meaningful-scale alpha device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.

    This Phase I SBIR project proposes to research and develop a fully pen-centric software application for tablet devices which has the potential to become a groundbreaking component of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Teachers and students are rapidly gaining access to mobile tablet devices with touch sensitive screens and educators are quickly adopting one-to-one (1:1), online, blended and distance learning environments wherein teachers and students have mobile tablet devices. The research and development of Phase I will create a new application providing online collaborative math (OCM) for use on networked tablet computers. OCM brings the power of co-located persons working side-by-side and collaborating with paper and pencil to distributed online environments with students writing on tablets.  OCM enriches the static paper-and-pencil experience with powerful handwriting and gesture-driven math functionality for computation, graphing, and interactive illustrations enabling rich online collaboration. OCM has the potential to evolve into a robust commercial application suitable for worldwide use by teachers and students for the teaching and learning of math and science.

    OCM provides a high degree of interaction using handwritten math notation on tablet computers. Increased interaction in distance learning is associated with improved achievement and student satisfaction. The development of OCM is both an art and a science. The art involves making OCM feel like a true collaboration. The science involves developing the technology to create the feel of true collaboration. OCM enables two or more persons to create documents for their collaborative use in teaching and learning STEM subjects. OCM will provide an innovative mechanism to synchronize document state among multiple editors in real-time with minimal or no loss of data/information due to edit conflicts, thereby producing the feel of true collaboration.  OCM represents over 10 years of research and development in the field of pen-centric math expression recognition and is presently covered by three patents pending. The goal of Phase I is to build a prototype OCM application and test its feasibility and efficacy in a computer simulated teaching environment. Ultimately, OCM will have a broad impact on the worldwide use of tablet computers in online, distance, and blended learning environments.

    Research Phase I project would be commercialization of a surfactant (acyl ethanolamine)
    made from renewable raw materials, which do not compete with food sources. Surfactants
    are the bubbly components of cleaning products that give them their cleansing
    power.  Surfactants are manufactured from petroleum or from seed oils, such as
    palm oil.  The use of those raw materials increases greenhouse gas pollution and
    contributes to deforestation of rainforests.  Society is demanding environmentally
    sustainable (greener) products with reduction or removal of toxicity.  The demand
    for greener chemicals creates an opportunity to replace today's surfactants with
    greener alternatives. The surfactant chemicals produced in this project are inherently
    safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not used, and the
    surfactants are biodegradable and produced from renewable raw materials such as
    sugars, and as a result do not contribute to increased greenhouse gas accumulation.
    \ The acyl ethanolamine surfactant is designed to replace current commercial surfactants,
    which are contaminated, during the current manufacturing process, with the carcinogen
    1,4 dioxane.  The surfactant produced by the effort described here will not contain
    any 1,4 dioxane.  Successful completion of this project will demonstrate a new
    technology for the production of nonionic surfactants.  This is significant since
    nonionic surfactants represent about 40% of the $30 billion surfactant market.
    \n\nThe technical objective of this Phase I research project is to construct a
    Bacillus strain that produces an acyl amino alcohol surfactant, namely, acyl ethanolamine.
    \ Certain naturally existing peptide synthetase enzymes catalyze the linkage of
    particular amino acids to other particular amino acids.  In addition, certain
    peptide synthetase enzymes catalyze the linkage of particular fatty acids to particular
    amino acids.  Past work demonstrated that this system can be engineered to catalyze
    the creation of unique molecules, such as acyl glycinate (fatty acid linked to
    glycine).  During enzymatic synthesis of acyl glycinate, glycine is covalently
    attached to the synthetase via a thioester bond.  Product release is catalyzed
    by a thioesterse domain.  Release by a thioesterase results in production of fatty
    acid linked to the amino acid glycine.  Certain naturally occurring peptide synthetase
    enzymes use reductase domains to release products.  We hypothesize that release
    of acyl glycine via a reductase domain will result in the synthesis of acyl ethanolamine,
    rather than acyl glycine.  The objective of this Phase I project is to create
    a chimeric peptide synthetase enzyme that converts acyl glycine into acyl ethanolamine
    during the process of release of the product from the enzyme."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be a reduction in human exposure to harmful chemicals, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced volumes of solid waste for biodegradable foam plastic products. This project describes a project to develop biodegradable plastic cups and other products using a sandwich process that includes a foam core. The strength provided by the sandwich structure is designed to allow weight reduction which reduces the environmental impact. Grow Plastics? technology replaces petroleum-based polymers with reduced amounts of plant-based polymers.  The plant-based polymers used in Grow Plastic's process contain no harmful chemicals to leach into humans and the environment and generate as little as 1/3 the CO2 emissions per pound used.  Grow Plastic's technology enables the replacement of petroleum based plastics with as little as 1/3 the plant-based plastic, reducing solid waste by up to 67% by weight, and CO2 emissions from raw materials by as much as 90%.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to increase the service temperature of foam plastic products to at least 95 Celsius, while maintaining polymer densities below 0.1 grams/cubic centimeter.  In polymer products, the weight of plastic used is a key driver in product cost.  This Phase I research project, a partnership between Grow Plastics and Western Washington University, will use polymer blending, solid state foaming and polymer crystallization in order to generate samples for evaluation.  Samples will be evaluated in terms of thermal performance through dynamic mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and evaluation of product rigidity for final products.  The research project will seek to develop extremely lightweight products with service temperatures of at least 95 Celsius.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability of this technology to impact how every battery is made, tested, managed, and re-used in the near future. Batteries are ubiquitous, and their use is likely to increase in the future. As such, there is a growing need for low-cost, accurate methods for monitoring the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH) in real time to optimize performance and maximize lifetime. The technology that will be developed in this project will use ultrasound to noninvasively probe batteries and provide physical insights into SOC and SOH, and will work on any closed battery regardless of chemistry and form factor. Initial finding of this hypothesis have already been demonstrated and published. This is an unexplored area and presents a large commercial opportunity in each sector of the battery industry, including diagnostics, quality assurance, active cycling control, and the emerging second-life markets. Several advantages include sensitivity to subtle physical changes within cells, the ability to probe lab and commercial scale cells, and sub-millisecond readings. From battery R&D, to manufacturing, to management systems, ultrasound for batteries will help enable the efficient generation, storage, and use of energy worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of this technology leading to the first commercial ultrasonic battery analysis unit. The feasibility of 1) miniaturized pulser-receivers with pulsing and switching speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than commercial units, and 2) miniaturized transducers that can transmit and receive high quality signals will be demonstrated. This would enable the detection of high-rate phenomena and the use of multiplexed systems. 3) The use of fast data analysis algorithms for real-time SOC prediction using acoustics as the main input will also be addressed. These objectives are necessary for demonstrating the applicability of ultrasonic analysis to the battery R&D, manufacturing, and second life markets. The success of Phase I of this project will lead to the development of micron-scale sensors for incorporation in battery management systems. In Phase II, algorithms for SOH prediction and cycling control based on acoustic data will be developed, as well as investigation of the design and fabrication of microelectronic transducers will be performed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of a high speed and reliable wireless technology that will enable telecommunications and wireless network operators to keep up with society?s bandwidth and information needs. The tremendous growth of multimedia users and Internet traffic has placed a significant strain on existing communication networks. Over three billion people are connected to the Internet globally and the explosion of mobile devices will continue to accelerate the worldwide growth of Internet connectivity. Mobile network operators and other commercial and government entities with large transmission requirements for backhaul and access network applications need low cost and reliable high speed data transmission solutions. Whereas fiber is the preferred solution, it is often not practical and sometimes even impossible to install. The proposed technology will provide an ultra-high capacity wireless communications solution for advanced and developing countries that will provide an unprecedented combination of bandwidth and range to meet the next generation?s service needs of carriers, enterprises and government agencies around the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a commercial Free Space Optical (FSO) communications system that provides multi-Terabit per second data transmission capacity over long ranges. Specifically, the team will build on its numerous refereed publications for combining Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Polarization Division Multiplexing (PDM), and Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) multiplexing to address the technical hurdles that must be overcome to transform the scientific results into a commercial product for the wireless communications industry. Leveraging both experiments and simulation, the team will demonstrate how to achieve real-time performance within a price point and form factor suitable for a commercial product. With the successful completion of Phase I, the team will lay the foundation for Phase II by significantly advancing the readiness of the proposed technology and strengthening and validating its commercial position.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the CPU. Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are often used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. This is not sustainable from both an economical and an environmental standpoint, due to the power consumption involved and the lack of performance resulting from the limited parallelism of computation. Datacenters and cloud computing have long lost the ?green label? originally associated with internet technology and software. Their operators need to find more economical ways to process large amounts of data. Linear searches and data indexing can be performed economically within the memory itself, and at a several orders of magnitude increase in performance, due to the inherent parallelism of memory architecture. At the same time, this comes with significant power savings due to the elimination of data transport and CPU clock cycles involved. Datacenters will be able to serve more clients, with fever servers and less power consumption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the feasibility of in-memory data search and compare algorithms which utilize the inherent repetitive structures of high density memory chips. Initial calculations suggest several orders of magnitude improvement in data throughput by in-place computation and simultaneous elimination of data transport. This addresses the industry's significant need for lower power solutions for so called "Big Data" applications, which are expected to continue their exponential rise through the Internet of Things (IoT), where cloud-stored sensor data are expected to eclipse data uploaded by humans in the near future. This Phase I project will perform a detailed architecture study along with a commercially viable and backward compatible communication protocol as well as behavioral models aimed at establishing the commercial viability and at attracting potential clients and licensing partners. Detailed simulations of the novel digital to analog sensing circuitry will thoroughly investigate the key intellectual property, laying the groundwork for the commercial realization of this innovation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is to develop an affordable suite of modular devices and software that makes it easy to design, assemble, and automate a custom bioinstrument. The goal is to provide biologists with an effective method to employ microfluidic tools and automation to accelerate scientific progress and commercialize new technologies.  Microfluidic technologies promise revolutionary improvements in diagnostics and life sciences, but their market penetration is hampered by high costs, a lack of available instruments, and ineffective training curricula.  The components of this suite will be designed to be inexpensive and re-usable, so when the biologists' needs change, they can be repurposed. The software will be designed to provide step-by-step assembly instructions and automatically configure devices, so making an instrument will be like putting together a Lego set. The technology may be used to train high school and college students in real-world laboratory techniques.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop modular devices and software that will enable biologists to produce custom bioinstrumentation to accelerate their research. The Phase I effort will focus on new microfluidics tools and will include prototyping and testing.  This development proceeds on three fronts:  1) Implementing the software to allow simultaneous and nested automation-script execution.  This allows virtualizing instruments into blocks and hiding operational complexities from users.  2) Expanding device functionality to include thermal control, e.g., for rapid PCR, incubation, sterilization, etc., and to perform accurate, pulse-free, high-temporal-response fluid dispensing for droplet generation, HPLC, sample preparation, etc.  3) Prototyping and refining user-interface and curriculum materials on biology and engineering students in high school and college to find effective graphical interfaces for instrument design and assembly. In Phase II, the plan is to incorporate these interfaces into the software, so top-level design is intuitive, and instrument assembly follows clear step-by-step visual instructions.

    the feasibility of creating fine grain ultra-high strength steel (UHSS) castings
    using a novel semi-permanent active forced cooling mold casting manufacturing
    process. With the demand for low-cost high performance cast components for light-weighting
    applications for the defense, off-highway, automotive and construction industries,
    new manufacturing methods are needed for the production of steel and cast iron
    components. This innovation will utilize active cooling methods, effectively arresting
    the grain growth of the casting within the mold, and resulting in greatly improved
    mechanical properties, process yield and productivity. Compared to traditional
    sand casting, this process is predicted to reduce manufacturing cost per casting
    by up to 40%, and to increase productivity (casting throughput) by up to 150%.
    This disruptive technology targets the steel and other ferrous metal casting industry,
    which domestically accounts for over 10 million tons of steel castings annually,
    with revenues reaching $20 billion. This industry is highly fragmented, with frequent
    consolidation of smaller players.  The proposed technology will be implemented
    at the foundry level, providing significant improvement in casting quality, operational
    efficiency, and overall casting yield. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project
    includes the development of a semi-permanent mold casting system with active cooling,
    the determination of the effects of the active cooling on the performance of the
    produced castings, and a techno-economic study of the innovation in use at the
    foundry level to determine to costs/benefits of implementation at scale. The innovation
    of this technology lies in the application of active cooling to the casting within
    the mold, and in the semi-permanent mold construction. The main objective of this
    Phase I is to develop a proof-of-concept casting apparatus and to produce a series
    of steel plates with varying forced cooling rates from which to determine the
    effect of cooling rate in the mold on grain size, elongation, strength of the
    casting and soundness of the casting. It is anticipated that this manufacturing
    process will produce aerospace grade properties at cast iron manufacturing cost.
    Completion of this Phase I will enable scale up of the casting process to complex
    parts."

    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a biofungicide for application
    on organic farms as well as conventional farms and home and lawn care as an alternative

    a novel, broad spectrum, biofungicide for crop protection as an alternative to
    chemical fungicides. The novel broad spectrum fungicide is based on a fermentative

    Antifungal activity testing in in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated broad

    fungicides. The proposed broad spectrum biofungicide has no mammalian toxicity,
    and has been shown to be safe for non-target anthropods like honey bees. It also
    has been shown to not inhibit the growth of beneficial fungi. As part of the Phase

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to significantly improve the patient experience by providing easy, convenient, and fast delivery of protein therapeutics through the administration of high-concentration, low-viscosity solutions via subcutaneous injection. Currently, high-concentration antibody solutions have viscosities far above the recommended limit for subcutaneous injections. This project aims to drastically lower the viscosities of high-concentration protein formulations. The success of this project would greatly benefit patients by providing a much shorter administration time for drugs that now require hours of intravenous infusion. In addition, this solution can also improve therapies that are already administered subcutaneously by reducing the frequency of injections by increasing dosage. Development of this technology can also enable the development of protein therapeutics with promising efficacy, but intractable solution properties or commercially unattractive patent lives.

    The goal of this Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept data supporting the viability of a new formulation platform for proteins. This platform will generate a formulation containing high concentrations of protein therapeutics which may be delivered at substantially lowered viscosities due to a reduction in the intermolecular interactions among proteins. The formulation thus provides a subcutaneous syringe-compatible route to delivering biologics at high-concentration, and low-viscosity, ultimately driving a shift from timely intravenous delivery protocols to simplified subcutaneous injections. Constraints on subcutaneous delivery volume (<2 mL) necessitate antibody concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL. Unfortunately, viscosities far beyond the accepted injection limit (50 cP) are typical of this situation due to extensive interaction among the protein molecules. Current viscosity reduction methods attempt to regulate these interactions but have yet to substantially address the issue. The proposed work utilizes a novel process to gently formulate proteins using only FDA-approved materials. This approach eliminates the effect of the protein-protein interactions on the solution viscosity. The proposed project will involve development of the platform through (i) identification of optimal formulation parameters, (ii) demonstration of rheological improvements to high-concentration protein solutions, and (iii) demonstration of preservation of biological structure and activity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require more modeling to be codified and bring more stakeholders into the fold. Organizations need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that are capable of handling this wider range of data, are fully accessible to non-technical users, and allow more stakeholders to participate in this important process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. On one end, spreadsheets serve as a general-purpose, ad hoc modeling tool that is open-ended and accessible for many, and on the other, whole software applications whether packaged or custom developed are generally more powerful in important ways but usually sacrifice accessibility and generalizability. This project will produce a prototype of a collaborative integrated development environment for modeling that manages code and data. The technical feasibility of this prototype will be evaluated by developing a test framework that simulates the divergence and convergence of models and scores the outcomes. The commercial feasibility will be evaluated by testing with users building real models to understand the scope of functionality required to bring this to market.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project appears in three areas.  First, there is an $8B
    dollar market for legacy hardware network security products today that is in transition
    to Software Defined Security. Adoption of this general SDSec platform has the
    potential to accelerate that market transition and improve enterprise security.
    \ Second, this project's success as an open platform could dramatically shorten
    the time between research insight and at-scale production deployments; security
    software built to a lower bar of scale/resiliency is faster and easier to build.
    The end result will be an increased rate of innovation, and new markets for niche,
    fit-for-purpose security functions that today are not profitable for vendors to
    build.  Last, this platform could harmonize enterprise security investments and
    practices for on premise workloads with security investments for public cloud
    workloads, solving a key dilemma faced by leading IT organizations. This will
    make those organizations more competitive on the world stage.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the two hardest technical
    challenges in building an enterprise-grade network security function, scale and

    way across many network security functions is novel, and this particular approach
    of massively parallel, lightweight packet processing functions to achieve this
    is new to this domain.  Why now? The massively parallel design proposed here is
    far too expensive and impractical with traditional hardware-based network functions.
    Even traditional hypervisor-based virtual machines carry too much hardware overhead
    to make this design cost competitive. By using vSwitches and network security
    functions packaged as Linux containers, the hardware overhead cost per instance
    drops dramatically, and this class of approach for scale/resiliency may be proven
    practical."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new approach to analyzing and understanding concisely structured documents such as legal contracts. The success of this project would provide a technological disruption in the way legal documents are processed. This will result in reduced processing time and financial savings in the review of legal contracts. Moreover, achieving this level of disruption within the legal market has the potential to open the door to automate processing, improve quality, and reduce the cost of many other legal services impacting the entire economy. With a market size of $437 Billion within the US alone, the legal industry is ready for a technological disruption that would bring this market up to par with other industries that have been significantly improved with the adoption of cutting edge Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This underlines the massive commercial potential for the technology under development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues a new innovative approach to understanding and analyzing contracts with accuracy comparable to what can be achieved by humans. Regardless of the technology, accuracy is the most important metric for lawyers to trust and adopt this innovation. Standard NLP techniques cannot generate the desired level of accuracy without a new approach to the problem.  The approach proposed for this project creates innovative custom-defined rules that operate using standard NLP technologies to break a contract into a data structure capturing different aspects of the contract meaning and allowing a higher level of understanding for the contract. In order to achieve the desired accuracy, a new innovative recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to learn over the extracted contract-meaning-data-structure which significantly improves the accuracy of the entire system. These two steps form somewhat orthogonal learning processes and when coupled with human-supervised-learning can produce the desired accuracy. This project will allow a full assessment of the underlying technology by training the core engine on a sufficiently large corpus of contracts to test the hypothesis on a larger scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide robust, automated security protections to enterprise web applications. With the growing threat of attacks at the web application layer, security is a top of mind concern for both the developers and users of web applications. At the same time, defending against these attacks is a resource-intensive, error-prone process that typically is performed manually by specialized web security experts. The project will use application-aware analysis and an innovative information model to automatically build and deploy web security policies on enterprise servers, freeing the enterprise to focus on their core business and reduce the overhead of internal security teams. The project will also use a hybrid static/dynamic analysis to automatically craft server-side and client-side policies using modern web protection mechanisms to give users of web applications confidence that their interactions with a web application will be secure. This approach leverages cutting-edge techniques from program analysis and machine learning, and will advance the state of the art in automated security policy generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore ways in which automated security policies enact meaningful protection of sensitive resources. Protecting web applications is a challenging research problem in that automated approaches are either biased towards significant false positive rates, in which benign behavior is flagged as malicious, or significant false negative rates, in which malicious activity is not detected. This project aims to resolve this bias using application aware whitelists: the project automatically explores an application's behavior dynamically, and will also statically build a model of that application's purpose. The project is expected to yield two major components: a server-side protection module to isolate and harden sensitive resources on an enterprise deployment, and a client-side protection module to enforce fine-grained policies for users of the enterprise's web applications. The project will involve developing, analyzing, and improving both of these components using large-scale web applications and will integrate the experience and challenges of enterprises with leading web applications.

    in the next four years, currently being at $10.2 billion. The findings from this
    development work will also be incorporated into research based educational programs.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of a promising synthetic
    conopeptide analog to the noradrenaline (NA) molecule. Prior art has shown that
    NA, when bound to a surface (or included as part of a coating covering a surface),
    deters fouling marine invertebrates from settling, thus preventing biofouling.
    Another distinct advantage of using conopeptide based systems is their stability
    in the marine environment. The current efforts are focused upon improving the
    efficacy and antifouling performance of these molecules. The phase I research
    objectives are (1) conjugation of the bioactive conopeptide additive to the current
    foul release coating; (2) demonstration of antifouling efficacy and proof of concept
    by bioassay; (3) development of batch coatings for scale-up for marine field tests.
    The results will be useful for designing new test coatings for scale up and testing
    in the marine environment."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make it cheaper and faster for architects, urban planners, and real-estate developers (APDs), as well as many others, to work with detailed models of the real world. Designers in APD fields must visualize and render their projects in the context of the real world. Pictures, videos, 3D printing, and even virtual reality inform the design process and facilitate communication with lay customers and stakeholders. These applications require consistently detailed models of the built world, and this project will automate the generation of these models. We estimate that APDs spend at least $80M annually creating these models by hand; and that at least $300M more is spent on such models for simulations, special effects, and video game design. By algorithmically generating virtual models without human intervention, the significant cost (in time and money) of manual creation will be saved, freeing design professionals to do work they want to be doing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed models of the world for diverse commercial applications. The first hurdle is solving the problem of reconstructing surfaces representing the boundaries of real-world solids (buildings) from noisy point cloud data. While surface reconstruction is well-studied in a variety of contexts, it remains an open problem in general, as successful algorithms must be informed by priors on the intended datasets. Using a data-driven approach to segment and classify input point clouds will facilitate the application of different reconstruction techniques to different objects (e.g. trees or buildings). The second hurdle is development of a machine learning algorithm which handles the dual problems of procedural modeling and inverse procedural modeling from a single statistical model, enabling visually realistic predictions about the details of a given building, even when that information is not available from source data (which may be of inconsistent quality across a large geographic area).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be large: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making; the project has the potential to make real estate sales and marketing more efficient by allowing buyers and sellers to accurately represent properties online, reducing the need for on-site visits. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second exciting effect of the proposal will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic 3D models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware, near instantaneous creation of 3D models on device, and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work might include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create a 3D model of a physical site in order to document it. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids.  In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    \ This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as Age Related Macular Degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to get American's to consume more lutein and
    zeaxanthin, which will be achieved by increasing significantly the levels of these
    antioxidants in the most widely grown staple crop: Corn. Since corn is used in
    a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving the carotenoid content
    of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of health
    benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing consumers eating
    habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically feasible, corn
    varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that are also high in

    There is considerable genetic variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis

    The primary goal of this Phase I research is to create user-friendly genetic markers

    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer

    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be
    used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be
    used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project relates to the fact that the extraction and consumption of fossil carbon accounts for over 6 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.  While some mitigation approaches are fairly mature, like capturing CO2 for equestration or for enhanced oil recovery, they are very expensive in terms of both variable and capital costs and have little chance of ever providing a return on investment.  By not viewing fossil fuels and feedstocks through a circular economy lens, we estimate these companies miss an opportunity for approximately $50 billion per year in potential profit from hydrocarbons, including methanol, that could be made with waste CO2. If successful, our HI-Light reactor will enable a new economy based on the conversion of fugitive CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and solve the return on investment problem.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HI-Light, a solar-thermocatalytic "reverse combustion" technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other hydrocarbons at rate significantly greater than the state of the art. Previous approaches are limited by two roadblocks: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented, multiscale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.  The unique features of our reactor are (1) optimized light delivery to ensure that all of the catalyst material has enough light to activate the reaction and (2) an advanced nano-engineered photocatalyst which is functionalized with ligands to enhance CO2 capture and conversion.  The goal of this Phase I effort is to construct an integrated prototype reactor and evaluate its productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour and demonstrate a 10x improvement over the state of the art.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be the development of a dynamic thermal analysis system for use in aseptic food processing.  The true value of thermal properties for specific food products is required for the design of a thermal process to prevent possible bacterial contamination due to underheating, or degradation and formation of unwanted compounds due to overheating.  The proposed innovation would allow food processors to improve their understanding of thermal properties in rapid heating applications, and by validating novel food processing technologies. The impact is expected to be that the quality and nutritional value of aseptic processed foods should increase dramatically as it will eliminate the need to excessively overcook products to ensure their safety. The commercial impact of this research will be through enhancing the quality of aseptic processed food and of rapidly heated batter-based foods. As the aseptic food quality will be further enhanced compared to that of canned and frozen alternatives, this technology will also increase the growth of the rapidly growing aseptic food industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial prototype device capable of rapidly measuring the thermal properties of a material over a range of temperatures. Currently, there is no way to quickly measure properties, which are necessary for accurate modeling of rapid heating processes such as those used for aseptic food processing and for foods baked between hot irons, such as burgers. Without rapid measurement, the food product deteriorates before taking measurements. Phase I research should develop, build, and validate a physical prototype and associated software. Control and data acquisition software, along with data analysis and parameter estimation software, will be finalized and validated. The device will be tested against materials with known parameters to statistically validate its performance and accuracy. Finally the device will be tested alongside the prior state-of-the-art to compare its performance to the industry standard. The product of this research will be a commercially-viable prototype that has been validated against literature values and has been demonstrated to outperform current devices. The device will be able to measure parameters over a range of temperatures more accurately and in a fraction of the time of current methodology.

    to additive manufacturing (AM) designers, engineers, and technicians for making
    better decisions with regards to metal 3D printing. Through AM, one can fabricate
    complex parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. Perfecting an AM
    process is however non-trivial, entailing time-consuming and expensive shop-floor
    experimentation. For example, fabricating a typical hand-sized component on a
    metal AM machine can take several hours to complete, costing thousands of dollars.
    Consequently, there is significant interest today to replace experiments with

    clusters, such as those available only at national labs. This has largely deterred
    industrial progress and innovation. The proposed research has the potential to

    desktop workstations without loss of accuracy. An environmental impact of this
    SBIR proposal is that by promoting virtual simulation of AM, the amount of wasted

    of computational mechanics, and manufacturing. It proposes to develop a novel
    computational approach to additive manufacturing simulation that bypasses the
    memory bottleneck observed in traditional finite element analysis (FEA). By using
    a voxel representation where all elements are congruent (i.e. possess a rigid
    transformation symmetry) and have identical material properties, the memory requirements
    can be reduced dramatically and thereby speed up the simulation by orders of magnitude
    compared to traditional FEA software. Similar approach has been successfully demonstrated
    for problems in structural mechanics and topology optimization. The proposal aims
    to extend the approach to in-process AM simulation where G-code will be used to
    identify elements in a heat affected zone for laser and electron beam based processes,
    and the congruent elements will be identified for each phase in the process to
    reduce simulation time."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by satellite-based positioning systems like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-meter location accuracy within large GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive AC wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail and manufacturing all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost RF tags to better than 1 meter of accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to scale this localization technology so that it can support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of scalable multiple access protocols for ultrasound communication, networking protocols for synchronization and data collection, inertial sensor fusion algorithms for robust and accurate localization and APIs for app integration by third parties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes high quality data that indicates a population?s sense of well-being and environmental safety--two essential factors in the effort for long-term sustainability. MindRider and Multimer collect and analyze human signals at the neighborhood, town, city, and regional scale, thus providing proactive, standardized, geospatial, real-time information to improve both personal mobility and urban monitoring. MindRider and Multimer can help overcome limitations in two prevalent monitoring methods: 1) A reactive methodology for quantifying danger is to count accidents. While government-collected accident data is often reliable and includes many years' worth of information, it does not provide precise spatial details such as direction of movement. Most importantly, an injury or fatality must occur before a statistic is produced, which therefore misses all the non-reported minor injuries, as well as perceptions of danger. 2) Many researchers use qualitative instruments like surveys and interviews to study perceptions of safety without the occurrence of an accident But while qualitative methods are highly valuable, these methods cannot be deployed continuously, are often not geospatial, and their results may not be standardized.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges that stakeholders like transportation planners and real estate analysts encounter as they monitor rapid change in cities and towns. For these stakeholders, improved data helps to reduce the complexity, cost, and risk of site selection decisions like choosing the location for a store, transit hub, outdoor advertisement, home, or office. Existing location analysis tools show similar kinds of evaluations for very different neighborhoods, based on limited data that doesn't often change. MindRider, which pairs custom ergonomic biosensors with GPS-enabled smartphones to record EEG and location data, and Multimer, which categorizes and analyzes MindRider data against existing geographic inputs, has the potential to provide key insights for data-driven decision making. We have built the basic system to collect and analyze geolocated biosensor data and have proven the technical feasibility of collecting these data from a pilot sample population for an extended period of time. Our primary objective for Phase I is to improve our data modeling and analysis--with a focus on affective interpretation, biosensor comparison, geospatial and temporal statistics, and reproducibility--so as to offer a fully robust product that stakeholders will confidently integrate into their existing workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop an analysis software package to significantly reduce health care costs while simultaneously improving patient care by helping select the correct treatment for each patient. Every year an estimated of 1.4 million women undergo unnecessary treatments at a cost to society of $32.2 billion for breast cancer. At the same time, some patients do not receive the treatment they need. For instance, chemotherapy is not routinely recommended after surgical tumor removal for patients with early stage lung cancer, even though the disease will recur in a large number of them. The ability to correctly identify disease subtypes and patient subgroups is a pre-condition to the ability to distinguish between patients that need the most aggressive treatments, and those who will never progress or recur. Further, the proposed approach can improve the results of clinical trials. With an estimated 2,300 Phase III clinical trials per year in the US, a full 50% of them are destined for failure with a loss of $1 billion/year. This can be avoided if the correct inclusion criteria are defined, and the drug is administered only to the people most likely to respond.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel software package able to identify subtypes of disease based on the integration of multiple types of omics data. Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients and/or subtypes of disease. Many attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success so far. In addition, very few approaches are able to combine multiple data types and most of the time the analysis of each data type leads to different subgroups that are very hard to interpret. The technology proposed here will be able to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple types of high-throughput data such as mRNAs, miRNAs, methylation, etc. The goal of this project is to implement this technology as a software package that will facilitate its application in large scale consistent with real-world use. In addition, the plan is to assess the feasibility of this technology by performing an extensive comparison with the top three existing approaches:  Consensus clustering, similarity network fusion, and iClusterPlus using over 1,800 real patient data from 12 different studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create an economical, high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer mounted to a consumer drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to allow testing of air for the presence of harmful compounds over a specific geographical location. A frequency domain THz spectrometer is capable of characterizing many different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample. Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because of their size and complexity. However, recent advancements have made it possible to build a lightweight spectrometer that can be mounted to a drone. This is significant because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. chemical warfare agents or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local environment. The THz Drone will allow immediate and accurate detection of many harmful compounds in the air.

    The proposed project will demonstrate a compact, battery operated, frequency domain THz photomixing spectrometer that is capable of Doppler limited molecular spectroscopy and is constructed predominantly from economical off-the-shelf fiber optic components in a highly compact, light-weight form factor. The brass-board instrument will incorporate an optical phase-modulation technique to remove the effects of coherent detection and it will have a greater than 2 THz bandwidth with a spectral purity of better than 100 kHz. After construction, the instrument will be employed to measure Doppler limited molecular transitions of carbon dioxide mixed with water vapor. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument, a first-draft design for an integrated system weighing less than 3 kg and capable of being carried with a consumer drone will be generated as will a larger laboratory version of the instrument.

    to the opaque and complex financial impacts of volatile water conditions. This
    will improve the accessibility, cost, and effectiveness of index-based insurance
    contracts, which provide businesses with crucial financial relief from the droughts

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network infrastructure in data center networks.  While modern data centers leverage server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments in the lab have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The goal of this project is to run in a production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced with production conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve occupational safety and health outcomes within the fire service through translational research and development of an affordable wearable physiologic monitoring device. Nearly 50% of firefighter line of duty deaths are the result of sudden cardiovascular events and the societal costs of firefighter injuries are in the billions of dollars, yet many departments cannot afford the costs of implementing the firefighter monitoring programs. Therefore, the use of an affordable wearable which can gather, store and transmit physiological data in real-time has the potential to reduce fatalities, injuries and costs. The affordability of manufacturing the device is the major commercial innovation as it will extend the physiological monitoring capability to workers exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as firefighters, soldiers, chemical and biological lab technicians, and commercial drivers - groups that have not been able to afford the cost of longitudinal and/or real-time physiological monitoring and predictive diagnostics. The affordability of the device will enable researchers to further scientific knowledge correlating the interrelationship between experimental physiological monitoring and field-based data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be in the area of optical materials. Optical materials are widely used in applications such as eyeglasses, cameras, cell phones, fiber-optic cables etc. Novol aims to push the frontiers of innovation in optical material research by creating new polymers with a much better balance of optical properties relative to glass while being tough and lightweight. The goal is to provide significant improvement in vision quality for patients with ophthalmic disorders. Particular benefit could be seen in pediatric and hyperopic prescription markets where choices of lens materials are restricted due to greater demand on lens properties. Long term project goals will focus on making lower-cost and more efficient lens assemblies for imaging, diagnostics and surveillance applications. A parallel aim of the research is to reduce the environmental impact of existing optical polymers, which are often made from highly toxic materials. Commercial opportunity presented through this work will not only benefit the end users but also the lens manufacturers through its ability to utilize safe and bio-derived monomers like sugars for making a highly important category of materials in today?s markets.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate optical and mechanical advantages of a new class of polymers made from sugars. Sugars have versatile properties arising from their complex structures, presence of heteroatoms and multiple functional groups. This research aims to bring together principles of organic, polymer and biological chemistry to create a new type of highly transparent, strong and refractive polymers useful in many optical applications, including lenses. Recent innovation in optical materials has focused largely on increasing a singular lens property, refractive index, mainly to afford thinner lenses for prescription eyewear applications. Technical objectives of this work go beyond the need to create just high index optical polymers and focus on making polymers that balance high refractive index with other critical properties of optical materials such as low dispersion of light and desirable mechanical strength. Lens materials with such well-balanced properties are currently unknown and if created, will provide unique advantages for many commercial applications of lenses such as prescription eyewear, sports accessories, camera assemblies and device screens. Another technical objective of this effort will focus on co-polymerization of sugar derivatives with known synthetic polymers to improve the properties and bio-based content of existing polymers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will lie in the improved ability to accurately monitor indoor and outdoor airborne particles using the proposed low-cost, broad size-range, aerosol  sensor to be developed in this research project. Inhalation of aerosol particles can result in adverse human health effects, with the critical parameter from a health effect perspective being the concentration of particles smaller than 2.5µm, i.e. PM2.5. Measurements of PM2.5 are critical to understand the extent of particulate exposure that populations experience in different environments. This project?s proposed approach is to measure particle concentrations by charging them and sensing their abundance using sensitive low-current circuits. This approach allows for measurements over a broad size range and at low-cost. Most of the currently available aerosol sensors are only sensitive to particles larger than ~ 500 nm, and hence are unreliable for ambient measurements. The proposed sensor will, thus, likely generate a significant interest in the aerosol research community and the ambient air quality monitoring industry.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate aerosol concentration measurements over a size range of 10 nm to 2.5 µm using an electrical-sensing technique. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the novel combination of electrical-mobility aerosol classification, printed electrodes, low-current sensing electronics, and advanced inversion algorithms to result in a low-cost real-time, wide size-range, aerosol sensor. With printed electrodes, the signal response from the sensor can be tailored to be proportional to total particle volume concentration, and, thus, to PM2.5. The research objectives are to demonstrate the accuracy of volume concentration measurements made with our sensor for a range of particle types and size distributions. The successful completion of this project should result in a prototype sensor that can accurately measure total aerosol concentrations in different ambient conditions. This would be a first critical step towards the final development of a low-cost sensor for large-scale air quality measurements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable affordable access to quantum annealing quantum computers and to take the complexity out of the programming and application hosting tasks, which currently poses a major barrier of entry for potential users. The company expects quantum computing technology in the next few years to disrupt significant portions of the high-performance-computing environment for optimization problems, which has previously been characterized by slow and incremental performance improvements. This project would yield a platform that both increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of analyzing complex optimization problems, which could spur fast-paced innovation in wide areas of the economy that tackle such issues. These sectors include energy distribution, pharmaceutical design, cancer research, data analytics, cybersecurity, autonomous systems, planning and scheduling activities, financial services such as risk management and portfolio optimization, and basic and applied research in physics and chemistry.  In each of these disciplines, there are optimization-based computational problems that are currently intractable. The results of this research should enable a much larger community of experts to use the power of quantum computing to solve these important but currently intractable problems.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the need for a cloud-based platform for using quantum annealing computing technology. Quantum annealing computers have come to market in the last few years, and research laboratories and universities have used these machines to explore algorithms that could eventually be solved efficiently on them. Despite advances in performance of quantum annealing computers, little effort has been directed toward developing programming environments and tools that provide simple and inexpensive access to quantum computing capabilities. This project researches a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) with a suite of front-end and back-end tools that efficiently transform high-level computing problems into binary optimization formulations suitable for quantum annealing, simplifying and automating the low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to perform useful calculations. This project will further develop the PaaS to include a classical-quantum computing environment and framework for analysis of large data sets using standard distributed computing tools. The research explores the best software tools and platform methods to integrate emerging quantum computing capabilities into workflows by streamlining and making affordable the processing of data and by decomposing real-world problems into sub-problems amenable to quantum computers of today and in the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be commercially deployable equipment for screening, detecting, and removing aflatoxin contaminated corn from the global food supply. Exposure to aflatoxin, a dangerous fungal carcinogen, has been linked to liver cancer, childhood stunting, illness and death in humans and animals, and major economic losses for farmers and grain handlers in the U.S. and globally. Rapid batch screening equipment will expand the capacity of the grain industry to test more corn for aflatoxin contamination and minimize the high sampling error that currently plagues the aflatoxin testing process and risks greater contamination exposure downstream. In addition to batch screening equipment, opportunities also exist to develop handheld devices to identify contaminated corn in the field, and continuous flow optical sorters, deployed at grain handling and food processing facilities, to remove the contaminated corn and protect the market value of the healthy grain. The goal is to 1) Increase revenue for farmers in the U.S. and globally; 2) Protect the food supply and reduce the risks of greater contamination exposure for farmers, grain handlers, and consumers; and 3) Protect feed supply and improve productivity of livestock.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a specialized high resolution imaging system for rapid batch screening of aflatoxin in corn.  The research team will build the prototype unit and image processing software with the patented algorithm for detection of aflatoxin in corn, integrated with a high resolution, dual-camera system. With existing chemical tests for aflatoxin detection, it is difficult for grain handlers to test larger samples or every truck without causing major delays in operations. The key technical hurdle for rapid batch screening with this technology is reliable imaging analysis of sufficient size samples, screened fast enough for the imaging system to fit into commercial grain handling operations without disruption.  By screening hundreds of corn samples with the rapid batch screening prototype unit, the team will validate device accuracy of >95% true positive and true negative for detection of corn contaminated with aflatoxin, consistently across contamination ranges and proportions, at a processing speed fast enough to be deployed by commercial grain handlers on every truckload.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, and of its underlying technological innovation, is in enabling a diverse variety of applications involving interactive and immersive media, which are central to several sectors that are poised to grow substantially in the coming years. Specifically, the low-latency audio technology developed in the project is a critical enabler for the development of future products that are of significant value to several sectors of the technology industry including, most importantly, the enabling of fully immersive interactive media products for augmented reality games and related applications. Additional impact is expected in the advancement and support of musical collaboration over the internet and enabling remote music education, both with clear cultural and educational implications. Another significant impact is in enabling a truly realistic teleconferencing experience with considerable implications for both business and social networks, with the latter further providing a realistic alternative to fully interactive social gatherings of groups and families without recourse to costly travel.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a novel paradigm for coding and networking of polyphonic audio content at low-latency via efficient prediction, which is critical to numerous applications in the emerging field of interactive immersive hyper-realistic multimedia. Polyphonic audio, or the mixture of multiple periodic components plus noise, has long resisted effective prediction, thus forcing state-of-the-art coders to either employ long transformation that incurs substantial delay and is incompatible with applications requiring low latency, low complexity and low bitrate, or accept significantly degraded performance. This project develops technologies that approach optimal performance despite constraints on latency, complexity and bit rate, by effectively exploiting temporal redundancies in all periodic components of polyphonic audio signals. Specifically, the coding paradigm builds on the novel technique of cascaded long term prediction, which enables joint prediction of all periodic components in the mixture, at low delay. This prediction approach is complemented by the development of powerful low-complexity parameter estimation techniques to minimize resource requirements, effective adaptation to fundamental frequency changes, side information optimization to minimize bitrate costs, practical redesign of all coder modules to fully exploit the prediction capabilities, and enhanced error-resilience for streaming over lossy packet networks.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will address drug resistance in cancer
    patients through the advanced analysis of biopsies.  Not only is each patient
    unique but their tumor contains a high level of genetic diversity as well. Overlooked
    diversity within patient tumors can lead to inadequate treatment and consequently
    acquired drug resistance, and has also been shown to predict therapeutic response
    to certain drugs.  The proposed technology is capable of extracting and correlating
    tumor gene expression profiles to the spatial information and imaging of a biopsy
    so that a physical map of genetic diversity can be constructed.  The initial application
    of this method will be in immuno-oncology where the spatial locations of immune
    cells fighting cancer have been shown to predict response to treatment. The next
    step will be to elucidate all cell types in the specimen that are usually overlooked
    with conventional diagnostics and use this information for determining treatment
    combinations that would affect all types of malignant cells found in this tumor.
    This directly addresses the Cancer Moonshot Initiative's focus on combination
    treatments for personalized medicine.  Successful commercialization of this method
    will result in drug biomarker discovery services, precision screening for patients,
    and fundamental discoveries in biology by researchers using this tool to investigate
    various diseases.  \n\nThe technical innovation in this SBIR Phase I Project is
    the ability to correlate genomic analysis with spatial information to create an
    in-situ map of gene expression across the specimen.  Imaging and big genomic data
    such as sequencing have been mutually exclusive, and the ability to correlate
    them in order to visualize genetic diversity within a specimen would be informative
    for both screening and research.  The goals of this project are to demonstrate
    the ability to create a visual heat map of gene expression from archived biopsies
    and to show that this expression map identifies genetic diversity that standard
    analysis methods do not.  Quantification of this diversity and the locations of
    deviations in the tumor will be the basis of future screenings for drug responsiveness
    as well as basic research into the causes and treatments of various diseases."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of an inexpensive way to create projected displays on arbitrary surfaces. This can have a tremendous impact in the ease of deployment and maintenance of low cost high-resolution displays on existing common surfaces (e.g. walls, pillars, objects, whiteboards) as well as prototyped (3D printed, clay, or Lego) models. This opportunity can dove-tail well with the maker-movement that democratizes manufacturing, artistic creation, and design. All of the benefits of the maker movement for society, the economy, commerce, and education will multiply with the introduction of an inexpensive and easy to use technology for creating displays on arbitrary surfaces. New markets that are constrained due to the cost of current solutions will open up for adopting this low-cost technology. Such markets include elementary schools in need of collaborative interactive devices, mobile planetariums, inflatable temporary display structures for independent artists, and others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a completely automated solution to create seamless imagery using multiple projectors on an arbitrarily shaped surface. Additionally, the project aims to enable multi-user interaction with this multi-projector display on an arbitrarily shaped surface. The company is proposing to develop software that uses a distributed network of computers, projectors, and cameras to respectively drive, project, and observe the projected light on the display in order to automatically compute (a) the position, orientation, and color parameters of the cameras and projectors, and (b) the shape of the display surface. This automated process will operate by the push of a button and take a few seconds to minutes depending on the complexity of the geometry of the display surface. Using this computed information the system will (i) perform real-time image correction to register multiple projected images and thereby create a seamless display that looks as though it is being projected from a single projector; and (b) handle interactions of multiple users with the display appropriately.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to bring positive impactful changes to the economy, society, and scientific/technological understanding through intelligent voice-enabled technology. Commercially, the introduction of an intelligent, ultra-low power, embedded voice trigger will capture an important portion of the $113 billion global voice and speech recognition market, contributing to its expansion and that of related markets such as wearables and Internet of Things (IoT). The long-term potential impact is broad and encompasses the key players in the voice recognition ecosystem such as the mobile phone industry, semiconductor companies, chip designers, technology providers and system integrators, who will be enabled to innovate with the proposed platform. Societally, the day-to-day lives of users will be made easier by empowering them through the faster and natural use of speech commands to access device functionality and to retrieve processed information in real time. Furthermore, by performing onboard speech processing, the proposed technology alleviates many societal issues and challenges surrounding privacy and data protection with cloud-based solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an always-on, touch-free, embedded voice trigger with ultra-low power consumption for deployment in smart products and IoT systems. This novel speech processing technology transforms analog speech signals into biologically-inspired data-efficient binary pulse trains and processes them using adaptive state models. These models can be deployed in a network of reprogrammable automata with high accuracy using only the timing information of the digital pulses produced by the user's voice. Compared with conventional speech features, pulse trains, as used in the human auditory system, are highly robust to noise and lead to extremely small footprint hardware implementations, which are ideally suited for low power on-chip processing. Furthermore, by processing only ones and zeros with automata, the proposed approach requires no arithmetic, enabling real-time, complex voice processing capability that would otherwise be achieved at prohibitive costs or be relegated to the cloud. This keyword spotting technology is pre-configurable, customized for each user, and can be used in cellphones or similar portable devices with no network connection required after calibration. It offers increased security and privacy to access portable device features by eliminating the need to send potentially sensitive data continuously online.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve critical power budget issues in next generation wearable computing applications. Candidate applications require ultra-low power, require massive context-awareness computation, and need to perform in the noisy real world.  A large gap exists between consumer expectation and what can be realized using conventional circuit techniques. Reconfigurable and biologically inspired classifiers use proprietary mixed signal approaches that uniquely close wearable computing's power/performance gap.  Our Phase I deliverables focus on completing a minimum viable product (MVP) that will use gesture recognition to wake up/control behavior of a wearable device with a power budget in the low micro-watt range.  The demonstration would use programmable neural classifier engines acting on sensor stimulus to perform gesture recognition. This important step will allow the further development of the technology portfolio for a broader range of applications.

    The proposed project's central innovation lies in the mixed-signal approach to embedded computing to shatter the energy efficiency barrier of traditional digital systems. The Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) approach incorporates neuromorphic circuits which approach 5GMAC/uW processing efficiency for high-level classification tasks. The Long-term vision is to address a broad range of end applications through a family of mixed signal integrated circuits based on a novel and programmable architecture that operates at 2 orders of magnitude less power than a comparable digital implementation; to deliver solutions that are the world's most energy efficient implementation. When classification tasks which formerly required at least 10mW to perform can be accomplished within 100uW, a vast range of applications become possible. The impact will be most profoundly felt in the design of next generation portable devices- in particular complex event tracking functions in wireless sensor motes (enabling the Internet-of-Things (IoT)), next generation devices for wearable computing.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a non-invasive imaging technology to help save the vision of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision loss in the US and worldwide. The American Diabetes Association estimates that DR causes $98 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses annually. DR is a complication of both type I and II diabetes and results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Recent studies have demonstrated that small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation are a reliable indicator of pre-stage and early-stage DR -- before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of achieving such a high resolution, a major need exists for the development of advanced retinal oximetry technologies with demonstrated clinical utility. This project aims to meet this major need based on a novel approach to functional imaging, thereby improving the lives of U.S. citizens and reducing the devastating economic impact of DR. By mitigating its occurrence, the technology developed as a result of this project will help reduce the cost of DR treatment and its overall economic burden.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a non-invasive imaging technology to provide high-resolution retinal oxygen saturation maps of diabetic patients in one snapshot. There are no existing commercial technologies with these capabilities; the proposed technology is a first-of-its-kind effort. Compared with existing methods, the successful outcome of this project can become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. This non-invasive, instantaneous and easy-to-use biophotonics technology will aid in both the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy. This project's scope includes three parts. First, bench-scale studies will validate the innovative, physics-based concept and algorithm proposed as the basis of the technology. Second, a prototype will be developed and tested. Finally, the technology prototype will be validated in a clinical setting to establish the utility and effectiveness of the technology in an actual operating environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to attempt to close what has been called the "largest financial protection gap in the world," the impact of a large U.S. earthquake on a major population center. The public is woefully unprepared for the consequences of such an event, banking on government assistance rather than personal resilience. In California alone, there are 3-4 million uninsured seismically vulnerable homes and 1 million uninsured vulnerable businesses. Of 1-3 million homes in need of strengthening, only about 20,000 are seismically retrofitted each year. Part of the problem is that insurance companies calculate the likelihood of a payout for a policy, but homeowners cannot, so homeowners lack the means to act in their own best financial interests. The free and ad-free mobile app under development for this project uses public data and methods to explain a home's seismic risk and to show the benefits of buying a seismically safer home, retrofitting an older home, or purchasing earthquake insurance. Most important, it does so without scaring, soothing, or snowing the user. Homebuyers can use the app at open houses and also at the residences of family members.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has three principle objectives: (1) The seismic hazard estimates will account not only for earthquake shaking, but also for whether a home lies on a steep slope or in a liquefaction, landslide, or fault zone, which increase the damage potential. With this enhancement, insurance will be more economical than retrofit in some locations because it is expensive to retrofit in a landslide or liquefaction zone. (2) The technology will combine several real-time data streams to predict the earthquakes that app users have just felt, notifying them within tens of seconds. With this feature, the company aims to provide the fastest, most personalized, most useful, and most accurate earthquake notifications ever achieved. (3) The app will include a global earthquake forecast, so that anyone on Earth with a mobile phone can learn their earthquake exposure. This forecast is based on the first and only independently tested, published, and globally uniform earthquake occurrence model. App users can learn about the largest earthquake they are likely to experience in their lifetime, and how to take action to protect themselves and their families.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to various cyberattacks. Furthermore, the proposed tool can allow organizations to audit big data usage to prevent abuse and misuse of the stored data. The existence of such a novel tool may increase trust in these big data management systems, and protect the sensitive data stored in such systems against various outsider and insider attacks. The company believes that such a tool would address an important customer need and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data management technologies such as Hadoop and Spark. The company plans to pursue a freemium business model and open source some of the developed code. This in turn may improve the data protection capabilities provided by existing freely available open source tools that can be used by many different companies and organizations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove the feasibility of a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool.  This new tool will provide enhanced security and privacy protection capabilities such as enforcing privacy policies using on-the-fly data masking, enforcing security policies using role-based access control techniques, and enforcing governance policies using data encryption, and advanced auditing and accountability features in one tool without the need to modify/change the underlying big data management system. To successfully develop the proposed prototype, the company will address many technical challenges such as developing efficient privacy-preserving policy enforcement solutions with very little overhead, and designing an interactive user interface that supports easy governance and privacy policy specification tasks. To address these technical challenges, the company proposes to leverage recent advances in aspect oriented programming to inject code directly into submitted data analysis jobs in a seamless manner to enable transparent data encryption, data sanitization, and accountability, compliance and governance policy enforcement. Using this injected code, the data that is stored in encrypted format could be decrypted and sanitized before it is used for data analysis as needed. Furthermore, necessary logs could be generated for accountability purposes.

    process and proper orientation within the film structure. Collaborative research
    is needed to select likely MOF candidates, to incorporate these MOFs in films

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing and producing a sustainable ink
    for the printing industry. Ink is commonly used in a variety of applications,
    and billions of pounds of ink are produced annually.  The majority of chemicals
    within ink are petroleum based and are mined from the earth.  These chemicals
    also are toxic to humans and the environment. Nature has produced a multitude
    of molecules capable of replacing components currently utilized in ink. While
    many organisms that produce these replacement molecules are slow growing and require
    energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, specifically cyanobacteria,
    are capable of being engineered to generate some of these replacement molecules
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease the overall detrimental impact of traditional
    inks on the environment and human health. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop sustainable ink formulations using engineered cyanobacteria cells capable
    of generating cellular pigments that will make the cultures optically black in
    appearance.  These optically black cells will act as pigments that replace mined
    pigments found in traditional ink formulations. This project uses entire cyanobacteria
    cells in ink formulations so that extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary,
    thus saving energy and reducing cost.  While currently utilized pigments used
    for ink are minerals mined from the ground such as carbon black, which is a finite
    material, cyanobacteria are a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as
    these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise
    unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition
    to the development of renewable cyanobacteria strains considered to be optically
    black, this project will develop optimal growth conditions as well as techno-economic
    models leveraging these strains within several subsets of the ink industry.  Using
    cyanobacteria to produce ink products is a novel application, which will be a
    major breakthrough for the algal bio-products industry."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the experience of online shopping for clothing, currently the largest segment online in the US with $51 Billion in sales for the last year and a focus for millions of consumers and thousands of companies.  The innovation in this project would improve the ability to discover and compare the visual appearance and style of clothing items, allowing more effective shopping over an increasingly large marketplace with millions of items, and improving the efficiency of the online clothing market.  In addition, the project will improve the ability of computational algorithms to automatically parse and understand clothing style, part of building computers to understand our daily world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop novel techniques for identifying, comparing, and predicting shopper preferences for clothing styles.  These will be based on computer vision to recognize visual features of clothing styles and machine learning to build models of shopper preference from their interactions while shopping.  Development will include representation learning for visual appearance of clothing style as well as for the factors that contribute to personal preference for style.  These models will be used to automate search and recommendation systems for clothing shopping, opening up new business opportunities for machine-learning enabled personalization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes: 1) development of novel encryption and authentication technology to improve cybersecurity and 2) the reduction of economic loss due to data breaches.  The larger societal need for new technologies in the cyber arena has been well documented over the past 10 years.  With the growing dependence on computers in practically every aspect of modern life, use of social media, large industries moving towards high performance (faster) computing networks and the coming era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the market for cyber technology is expected to grow at a steady rate of as much as 15% annually.  This project will create a high speed, parallel and Truly-Random Number Generator (TRNG) with signal embedding capabilities.  With an optical core, the device will have advantages over many of the currently available, pseudo-RNG devices based on silicon chip technologies that have been shown vulnerable to hackers.  Additionally, this device will provide a framework for continuous development and possible online authentication features to compliment the hardware.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in development of a prototype device to assess the feasibility of a commercial product.  The basis of the innovation is the use of quantum phenomena in optics to create randomness, also known as noise.  Quantum mechanics has proven to be the underlying mechanism for noise processes used the world over in encryption of data.  In this case, the process of creating noise can be adjusted, oscillated at some frequency, to produce embedded signals overlaid with the random output.  This gives the final design applications well beyond encryption.  With the rise of high performance computing networks in scientific simulations, health care patient tracking, financial institution accessibility, education, etc., the ability to use the embedding feature to track authentication credentials and perform continuous monitoring of equipment accessing a network becomes paramount to securing networks as well as data.  During this project the basic design will be refined with the aim of producing a rescaled, commercial product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project includes the development of new methods to biodegrade waste plastics. Plastic waste is an significant environmental burden. Over 300 million tons of plastic are used each year, resulting in millions of tons of persistent plastic waste, some of which can take up to 600 years to degrade. Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) can digest polystyrene, also known as Styrofoam, a persistent and widespread source of plastic waste. Beta Hatch Inc. is developing a novel approach to reduce plastic waste. As the mealworms feed, they convert polystyrene into protein and biological waste (frass), both valuable nutrient inputs for animal feed or for fertilizer. This project will screen mealworm strains to identify the best candidates for optimization, develop polystyrene feed mixes to improve the efficiency of digestion, and test the end-products to understand how these might be commercial used. The project will also confirm the safety of polystyrene derived biological products (mealworm protein and frass) for use in the production of non-food animals and fiber crops. This work will support the development of novel and commercially viable approaches for biodegradation of plastics.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop the commercial potential of mealworms for plastic bioremediation. Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic long-chain hydrocarbon polymer. It is a major waste product that takes up 30% of landfill space. The formation of strong molecular bonds between neighboring styrene monomers makes polystyrene extremely stable and therefore extremely difficult to degrade. Mealworms are the only proven organism capable of depolymerizing and mineralizing polystyrene, with the help of beneficial gut microbes. However, for polystyrene biodegradation to be commercially viable, the efficiency of digestion needs to be increased, and the safety of products derived from PS feeding needs to be assessed. Existing work has shown that there is strain-specific variability in PS digestion, and that PS digestion efficiency is only ~50% without additional nutrients. Further, PS feeding may decrease the fertility of mealworms, which would limit the long-term commercial feasibility of mealworm based PS-digestion. This project will identify mealworm strains that show high potential for polystyrene (PS) digestion, test the ability to breed animals with enhanced PS capability, develop feed mixes for optimal efficiency of PS biodigestion, quantify impacts of PS feeding on mealworm life cycles, and collect preliminary data on toxicity of PS-derived biomass and frass products. These experiments support the objectives of 1) identifying pathways for scaling up PS biodigestion by mealworms,  2) integration of PS wastes as a feed for mealworm farming, and 3) collection of key data on the marketability of end-products from polystyrene digestion. This feasibility project&#8232;will also catalyze conversations with customers and regulators on the business challenges and opportunities associated with plastic biodigestion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to make video searchable and discoverable in a cost-effective manner by automating video annotation tasks that are currently done manually. Video is being created at an increasingly high rate, and media companies are becoming overwhelmed by the sheer amount of video in their libraries.  Companies have resorted to paying people to manually watch their videos and "tag" them with relevant descriptions so that the content becomes searchable and therefore useable.  In this project the company will build an inference engine that can leverage the data and structure within video to discover specific multimodal concepts significant to the particular domain and automatically train and refine classifiers to apply unique and meaningful data describing the video.  Leveraging this metadata, companies can index and search their videos more efficiently, enabling them to generate tailored video clips to meet specific goals, and ultimately publish video at a much larger scale.  The company believes the unique domain-specific video metadata generated by its system will have an overwhelming effect on the ability of companies to disseminate informative videos, and improve their use of video online.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project proposes to develop an inference engine that combines the modalities of information in video to automatically discover and train multimodal classifiers for important concepts within specific domains.  Current approaches to video understanding seek to develop general visual classification models; these approaches focus on leveraging labeled data to train supervised learning algorithms in order to describe the video. These approaches fail in specific verticals, because the information output is not granular enough to provide value within the context of the specific domain, and the cost for manual annotation is high. The approach proposed in this project takes into account the multimodal information associated with a group of related videos to automatically learn classifiers for concepts that are important in this video domain, without expensive manual annotation. The approach leverages the correlations between the different modalities in video and existing domain-specific structure to intelligently accomplish this task.  The company expects this research to lead to the discovery of many new domain-specific video concept classifiers that do not exist in current visual ontologies, and a reusable approach for training visual classifiers that can be applied across many domains.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent or reduce the high risk of post-meniscectomy
    osteoarthritis (OA) following partial meniscectomy which is a popular treatment
    for meniscus tears. Meniscus tears represent common lesions injuries prevailing
    in ~36% of people with ages at and greater than 45 years old, but with few effective
    treatments.  Meniscectomy is performed to temporarily relieve the severe pain
    and other symptoms associated with meniscus tears. Over one million patients undergo
    meniscectomy to palliate painful symptoms associating torn meniscus each year
    in the U.S. The drawback of meniscectomy is significant increases of incidence
    of osteoarthritis (OA) later in life (by as high as 7 folds), because loss of
    meniscus causes altered load transmission, decreased shock absorption, and decreased
    joint stability and increased joint cartilage contact stress. Post-meniscectomy
    osteoarthritis (OA) is well documented in literatures. OA is more challenging
    to treat and incur more costly expenditures and causes more severe physical sufferings

    This SBIR phase I project seeks to address the critical need for lung cancer diagnosis at an early stage. North America has the highest age-standardized incidence of lung cancer in the world. An estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed this year and 158,080 deaths are predicted to occur due to lung cancer in 2016. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is much lower when compared to other common cancers due to late-stage diagnosis of the disease in these patients. The survival rate for lung cancer patients significantly improves when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Early detection of lung cancer by computed tomography scanning is disadvantageous to high false positive rates and the need for invasive and expensive follow-up procedures. The breath analysis technology described in this project can mitigate this health crisis by drastically reducing false positives, lowering the cost of diagnosis and reducing the need for repeated radiographic scans or invasive biopsies. Moreover, the cutting-edge breath analysis technology described in this project can be used for other applications, such as environmental monitoring or detecting other diseases including cancers elsewhere in the body.

    The central innovation proposed in this project is a silicon microreactor consisting of micropillars coated with a carbonyl-selective reagent that covalently captures volatile carbonyls of cancer metabolism exhaled in alveolar breath. The microreactor retains the adducts of these metabolic markers, concentrating them up to 10,000-fold, while allowing all other tidal breath components to pass through unaffected. The biomarker adducts of the chemoselective reagent are eluted from the microreactor using methanol and then quantified via mass spectrometry. Elevated concentrations of certain carbonyl biomarkers are indicative of cancer. The Phase I research objectives are to demonstrate the effectiveness of newly engineered, fast-flow microreactors coated with chemoselective reagents designed for enhanced reactions with unsaturated aldehydes. The microreactor design will be optimized so as to evacuate exhaled breath samples through the microreactors at 10-fold the current rate without compromising VOC capture efficiencies. Also, new hydrazine-based reagents will be synthesized to serve as microreactor coatings in combination with the current carbonyl-selective microreactor coating. These innovations will enable the microreactor approach to overcome the critical challenges faced by current breath analysis technologies for early detection of lung cancer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be a significant improvement in the control of dangerous mosquitoes that transmit serious diseases to humans, including Zika fever, malaria, encephalitis, chikungunya, and dengue fever. This project will generate a novel larvicide directed against the larvae of harmful mosquitoes that live in water. The larvicide is combined with an efficient lure to generate effective bait-and-kill stations that will target only harmful mosquito species. An efficient, inexpensive, safe product to kill mosquito larvae will improve public health since it will greatly reduce the number of adult mosquitoes capable of infecting humans with diseases. The product will protect non-target species and will not contaminate the water with toxins. This project incorporates several new technologies that are also  applicable  to  the  future  control  of  other insect pest species, including a novel design system to produce lures that attract mosquito larvae to bait stations, a new method to kill insect larvae while leaving other species unharmed, and a new method to package the control product. The product and the methods discussed are new, address unmet health and safety needs in several countries, and are expected to have widespread market appeal.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are focused on providing novel attractants for the aquatic larvae of Aedes aegypti and other harmful mosquitos, and combining these lures with a novel larvicide that will eradicate the targeted larvae without contaminating the water column with insecticide or harming non-target species. The mosquito?s range is expanding and traditional control methods are becoming problematic. An effective bait-and-kill device would avoid the wide dispersal of broad-range insecticides and protect the environment, beneficial species, and humans. However, this device requires an efficient attractant to selectively lure mosquito larvae and an effectual, yet selective, larvicide that will not harm non-target species or contaminate  the  water.  These are therefore the foci  of this project.  This project incorporates several novel approaches to develop a microencapsulated nanoparticle that will function as a targeted larvicide. To achieve the stated goals, compounds that strongly attract mosquito larvae will be combined with a nonpoisonous polymer larvicide that is active only uponingestion by the larvae.  The anticipated end product is a bait-and-kill device for A. aegypti larvae that would allow a shift away from broad-spectrum insecticides to a more targeted, responsible control methodology. The platform technologies are applicable to other species in the future.

    Research Phase I project is to improve respiratory protection against ammonia
    by using novel carbide-derived carbons (CDCs). The outcome of this project will
    improve the safety and health for industrial workers, firefighters, and first
    responders that encounter ammonia in industrial settings and emergency situations.
    Current respiratory protection gas masks attempt to prevent users from breathing
    ammonia by trapping the toxic gas on an adsorbent material. Adsorbents on the
    market provide limited protection time against ammonia due to poor attractive
    forces between the adsorbent and ammonia. CDCs overcome these limitations through
    a new synthesis procedure that creates ammonia-specific active sites within its
    structure to bind and trap ammonia. Research on these materials will unlock the
    tools and methods necessary to tailor these adsorbents to other toxic gases. The
    proposed R&D activities address a commercial opportunity within the respiratory
    protection market estimated to be a $6 billion market globally, and $2.4 billion
    market in the U.S. \n\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project
    are to synthesize CDCs that can be easily integrated within a filter cartridge
    and to provide an order of magnitude increase in protection time against ammonia
    compared to current materials. CDCs have promising performance and an enormous
    amount of research activity has been devoted to the synthesis and characterization
    of CDCs for adsorptive applications. However, to date, no commercial adsorptive
    applications of these materials exist. This situation exists in part because insufficient
    attention has been paid to the integration of selective gas adsorption sites,
    control of particle size, and hydrothermal stability, all of which are key technical
    hurdles that will be addressed in this project. This goal will be accomplished
    by synthesizing and testing granular CDCs for selective adsorption of ammonia
    from air, integrating further ammonia-specific active sites via post-synthesis
    modification techniques, and evaluating hydrodynamic and thermal stability of
    CDCs through cyclical stability testing methods. The results from this project
    will significantly further our understanding of CDCs in terms of large particle
    size synthesis, long term stability, and tailored active sites for gas capture.
    The anticipated results would significantly further CDCs for ammonia filtration
    and other commercial separations applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is to addresses challenges in understanding, analyzing, and visualizing data from large sets of unsorted, noisy data associated with massive next generation sequencing (NGS). These projects frequently are focused on pathogen transmission patterns, drug resistance, and general epidemiology and employ a process called "clustering"; however, current clustering tools are rudimentary, not intuitive, poorly documented and provide little help with data management and visualization. The goal is to develop software for Clustering and Associating Sequences in a Personalized Environment (CASPER). This software will bring much needed state-of-the-art software engineering and visualization technology to NGS sequence analysis that results in finding correlations in disparate data-types that are currently overlooked. Further, this software addresses commercial demands for integrated bioinformatics that speed discovery using contemporary and innovative technologies that enhance the end-user experience.  This will increase the ability of researchers to combat major health challenges, perform biological research and develop effective interventions to prevent and treat illness.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a bioinformatics application designed for biological researchers to explore the evolutionary relationships in very large sequence data sets. These data are commonly associated with multiple annotations and there are time-consuming hurdles in acquiring a meaningful visual representation of their relationships, especially in combination with geospatial, demographic and/or temporal data. Further, while many bioinformatics applications/approaches focus on achieving a single analytical task, the proposed software focuses extensively on the end-user, so that efficient and accurate data processing are combined with rich and meaningful graphical outputs. In addition, it will provide a graphical database management system (GDBS) built around the researcher's data as it is imported, resulting in fewer errors. A database linked to analytical results allows for rapid result filtering as well as instantaneous updates as data sets expand over time. Integrated visualization tools allow researchers to produce varied network graphics that can show how results change over time. In Phase I, the goal is to focus on developing a framework to optimize the end-user experience (e.g., speed, intuitive design, useful formatting of results). The project brings together a powerful and unique group of scientists in the fields of software design, computer modeling, data visualization, bioinformatics, genetic analysis and epidemiology.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is the development of technology for use of sulfide mining
    waste streams as a novel energy source for the production of chemicals from CO2.
    Sulfide mining wastes pose a serious, perpetual environmental risk, and are continuously
    generated as by-products of mining operations. The sulfide minerals in mining
    waste also are viable energy source for a diverse community of microbes that derive
    their energy from the oxidation of these minerals. This biological oxidation releases
    significant amounts of energy from the rock. The energy released from one ton
    of sulfide mining waste is approximately equivalent to one barrel of oil. Approximately
    95% of copper ores are found in sulfide-rich ore deposits and at about 20 million
    metric tons annually, constitute ~15% of mining waste (representing millions of
    barrels of oil).  From genetically engineered microbes, it is proposed to use
    this energy to generate chemicals from CO2. As such, sulfide waste streams represent
    a new high energy feedstock for the sustainable production of chemicals from CO2.
    This technology will improve the sustainability of mining and provide a non-agricultural,
    non-photosynthetic and economically attractive route to carbon-neutral chemicals.\n
    \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the development of genetically
    modified A. ferrooxidans for the utilization of mining process waste streams as
    a feedstock for biotechnology applications. Readily available sulfur-rich waste
    streams produced during the traditional smelting processing of copper contain
    about 40% per metric ton of the energy of glucose, and about 20 million metric
    tons are produced annually in the U.S. These energy intensive waste streams are
    currently landfilled, and their environmental oxidation can lead to acid mine
    drainage. To leverage this opportunity, the ability to rationally engineer this
    species to produce isobutyric acid from atmospheric CO2 has been developed. The
    specific aims of this proposal are: 1) develop model reactor systems to characterize
    performance and operations using actual mine tailing feedstocks; 2) improve biological
    productivity through further metabolic engineering of A. ferrooxidans; and 3)
    develop a sophisticated techno-economic analysis of the novel bioprocess. In addition,
    a commitment from a mining company for access to a tailing feedstock supply and
    a site to construct and operate a pilot-scale plant will be secured. Accomplishing
    these goals will prepare for a future follow-on Phase II proposal to scale-up
    our technology, further characterize performance on actual process streams, and
    demonstrate large-scale process feasibility."

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this project will be to create a depth vision system that accelerates
    the transition to intelligent automation. The intelligent automation movement is driven by the opportunity
    to increase human productivity, and it can be seen in all domains: from Siemen?s self-organizing
    manufacturing plants to Amazon?s proposed delivery drones. This project aims to improve robotic vision,
    which is currently a limitation to greater autonomy. The research uses innovations in semiconductor
    physics to create time-of-flight depth cameras that reach new levels of spatial resolution and fidelity. These
    cameras, in conjunction with rapidly evolving software that uses depth data to model the physical world,
    give robotic systems the human-like abilities they need to perform more complicated tasks in dynamic
    environments. Robotics will become increasingly effective at the navigation, material handling, and object
    manipulation tasks that are the basis of so many manufacturing and logistics processes. The project
    outcomes will advance the state-of-the-art in depth vision technology, and provide a prototype camera that
    can be used to test a variety of challenging object recognition tasks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an important limitation in depth
    cameras that use the phase delay time-of-flight (TOF) method. Existing TOF cameras use ?pixel-level
    demodulation?: specially designed photodetector arrays where each pixel performs both light detection and
    demodulation. This design limits the modulation frequency, and thus depth accuracy, because the high
    frequency signals create excessive noise and parasitic capacitances. The authors propose an alternative
    ?optical demodulation? design wherein light is demodulated by a single fast optical shutter, and then
    collected by a separate conventional image sensor. By separating light modulation from light detection,
    parasitic capacitances are eliminated and it is possible to reach high frequencies with acceptable power
    consumption and noise. The research program will develop new optical shutters that demonstrate these
    characteristics, and integrate the shutters into a functioning prototype depth camera. Success will show that
    TOF cameras can be produced with substantially higher spatial resolution and design flexibility.

    This project will develop an immersive and dynamic multi-player game that addresses a pressing need to provide engaging technologies that prepare students to apply collaborative, cross-disciplinary scientific practices to global societal challenges. In an augmented classroom with their real life peers, students must establish a colony on Mars that is capable of sustaining thousands of refugees from Earth. To successfully achieve their goal, students must use raw materials found on Mars to produce components necessary for life support and building, such as food, water, oxygen, and fuel. In the weeks that this simulation runs alongside their real classroom, students will apply cross-disciplinary STEM knowledge and practices to experience how both individual and collective actions have short- and long-term effects. The game and supporting curriculum will address content from the Next Generation Science Standards and ultimately help adolescent youth understand the need for the integration of science and engineering to tackle critical issues such as the production of clean energy, identification and treatment of disease, the allocation of adequate food and water, and global environmental change (NRC, 2011). Creating educational games that more closely mirror their AAA counterparts provides an opportunity to draw diverse genders and underrepresented youth into STEM-related fields.


    This project?' goal is to create "virtual field trips" that augment a classroom and run simultaneous to it, providing applications and experiential learning in a highly engaging social environment. It will build upon previous proprietary technology that enables simultaneous online interactions, complex distributed simulations, and data gathering in shared virtual worlds. This allows the project in its initial phase to focus not only on developing a quality game for students but also on designing and testing high-risk approaches to classroom integration. This game includes the teacher and suggests actions that alter narrative arcs, provide students with key knowledge, or increase or constrain other material resources students have available. Teachers will be able to leverage data collected on student game play to pair small, dynamic groupings of students with high impact mini-lessons to allow the project to actively support teachers as they implement personalized, data-driven instruction. By including a teacher-friendly assessment toolkit, the project can operate within districts' current requirements while experimenting with the future of educational gaming in the classroom. Phase I research will focus on usability and impact on student learning, as well as attempt to understand how willing teachers are to accept and use the teacher support features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring to market a novel power chip architecture for battery-operated electronics, such as smartphones, wearable electronics, electric vehicles, blade servers, cloud-infrastructure hardware, telecom devices, tablets, routers, LED lightning, etc. There are four critical requirements of the power management integrated circuits (PMIC) when used in mobile devices: (1) high energy efficiency for a longer battery run-time between charges; (2) small solution size by freeing up extremely limited space for new functionalities; (3) fast response speed for wide variety of uses; and (4) simplified circuit design for shortening new products' time-to-market. Currently, no solutions are capable of simultaneously meeting the above four requirements. It has become necessary to consider a new topology that could help enabling more efficient Internet of Things designs. It is therefore an object of this proposal to develop novel power chips where the above four requirements can be easily met. Consequently, for any direct current powered mobile devices, as long as they are consuming large power, struggling with limited spaces, and requiring efficient cooling effects, the proposed solution aims to achieve the optimal performance.

    Unlike the present power management integrated chip (PMIC) solutions that have to lose one or more features for a certain improvement, the proposed intellectual merits achieve all of the important features in one single architecture without losing anything. The new PMIC architecture has been preliminarily verified using computer modeling simulation based on ideal circuit models. The objective of this project is to develop new power management chips for use in smartphones and to achieve optimal testing results when verified with 180 nanometer CMOS processes. The R&D scope includes intellectual property core block circuits design, reusable sub-module testing, and mixed signal top-level simulations where the combination of all blocks and modules will be thoroughly represented, within which a circuit that will be etched onto the wafer in Phase II must function correctly. This work?s goal is to demonstrate that the proposed PMIC architecture is a valid solution to fundamentally address the major pain points in the mobile device market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a large-scale process for production of vault-stabilized enzymes. This project will develop a new nanoparticle-based technology for stabilizing enzymes so that they can be used for industrial applications and environmental cleanup such as water treatment. By employing a scalable, high yield, low cost manufacturing system for vault-enzymes, the company would be able to deploy a variety of new products into the field for treating certain environmental pollutants in drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, and reclaimed water. This would give environmental engineers and regulatory agencies new tools to clean and protect national natural resources and public health.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a yeast-based production system for nano-scale vault particles. Vault nanoparticles are promising candidates to stabilize and enhance the performance of enzymes for catalytic industrial applications and biotransformation. The packaging of enzymes into vault particles combines enzyme purification and immobilization into a single manufacturing step, and is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly approach for immobilizing and protecting enzymes. Demonstrating feasibility of this system will allow simple integration of vault-enzymes into industrial manufacturing systems and would allow vault enzyme prototypes to be rapidly scaled up and deployed for specific environmental remediation targets.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to significantly reduce the electricity consumed by cooling and refrigeration systems. Cooling systems consume nearly 10% of the electricity generated in the United States. During summer months, cooling and refrigeration systems are needed the most, but are also when they are the least efficient. This results in a significant strain on our nation's electricity grid. By improving the efficiency of cooling systems, less electricity will be needed at the utility scale, particularly during peak hours and in the summer. Furthermore, operators of commercial cooling systems could reduce their overall electricity expenses and increase their revenues and profits. The project?s outcomes will also create a pathway to improve the efficiency of cooling systems that does not involve the use of increasingly scarce freshwater resources, and could eventually lead to more water-efficient cooling systems at the largest scales. Finally, this project's approach harnesses renewable resource, the sky, which is source of cooling that is currently untapped.


    The technical innovation being proposed harnesses a renewable resource, the sky, through a mechanism known as radiative sky cooling, to dramatically improve the efficiency of cooling systems. By using specialized optical surfaces that reject heat as thermal radiation to the sky, while simultaneously reflecting nearly all incident sunlight, it is possible to passively cool below the air temperature 24 hours a day. In this project, a refrigeration system incorporating such surfaces will be developed with the aim of demonstrating improved efficiency over conventional systems. In this process no water is evaporated and the only electricity needed is for pumping. Furthermore, modeling will be performed to understand how such a system could be scaled up for use in larger deployments. At the end of the&#8232;Phase I project, a pathway towards large-scale deployment of a transformative clean energy technology, used to improve the efficiency of cooling systems, will be demonstrated.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a point-of-care (POC) blood chemistry test that can measure multiple analytes simultaneously with a single drop of blood. Blood chemistry tests are the most frequently ordered tests by physicians. This proposed lab-on-a-chip and associated analyzer for blood chemistry tests will benefit society by improving the quality of health care delivery and reducing costs. This device?s minimally invasive procedure reduces: fear and discomfort caused by needles, level of skill needed for sample collection, and errors associated with pre-analytical testing steps. The device?s patent-protected optode technology, which utilizes the color spectrum to measure concentrations, differentiates it from electrochemical technology, which is used by competing POC devices. Briefly, optode technology has lower manufacturing complexity, requires much less blood, has a more robust output, and can test more analytes simultaneously. The initial target application will be neonatal blood chemistry testing because of a strong need to minimize blood draw volumes. Upon clinical acceptance of the technology in the neonatal market, the simple-to-use platform will be expanded to other applications, including acute care centers, first responders, primary care, military care, and disaster relief organizations. This platform will also be expanded to test many other analytes, and should help create many new U.S. jobs in the process.

    The proposed optode-based lab-on-a-chip device will be capable of testing various analytes simultaneously with a single drop of blood, which has not been achieved by commercial POC devices. This innovative optode technology has several advantages over electrochemical technology. First, the optode technology enables extremely small sample volume requirements compared to electrochemical sensors (6-10 ìL vs. 65-100 ìL) and eliminates the need for mixing of reagents. Second, fabrication complexity is greatly simplified using optodes because it requires less layers, less raw materials, and simpler manufacturing steps. Third, optode technology provides a more robust output by using a combination of multiple wavelengths on the visual light spectrum and not a single current output as used in electrochemical technology. Finally, this platform technology will result in unique multiplex analyte combinations, including the first ever handheld basic metabolic panel (BMP) test that requires just a single drop of blood. The primary goal of this
    Phase I SBIR is to demonstrate feasibility of this micro-dispensed, lab-on-a-chip system to evaluate clinical samples. In this one-year project, Objective 1 will develop automated sensor manufacturing methods. Objective 2 will confirm the performance of the developed lab-on-a-chip to quantify analytes in sera samples in FDA-required non-clinical tests and when compared to an FDA-approved, POC analyzer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at development of a novel, low-cost process for manufacturing environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) for ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) in aviation gas turbines. A key limitation for CMC adoption is the unavailability of inexpensive, truly gas impervious EBCs to provide required CMC engine service life. While novel EBC compositions have been identified, methods of depositing thin, dense gas impervious coatings with these compositions have largely been vapor-based processes that are expensive, inefficient (non-line-of-sight) and slow (low deposition rates). Efforts to utilize low-cost, and fast plasma spray processes, familiar to the turbine industry, have had some success, but still need major improvements. As an enabling technology for CMC adoption into aircraft gas turbines, the proposed EBC processing technology, solution precursor plasma spray, has the potential to fuel wider adoption of CMCs into aviation gas turbines. The EBC market itself, driven by such a wider adoption of CMCs, can grow to over $300 Million by 2025. The efficiency gains due to such wider adoption of CMCs can substantially lower fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 15% in new aircraft.

    The intellectual merit of this project is illustrated by the fact that it is the first demonstration of solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) for EBC processing. The unique ability of the SPPS process to achieve very thin, high-density coatings is driven by the very small splat sizes of the solution-derived particles relative to powder-based processes. The SPPS process offers a route to get coatings similar to what is feasible with vapor based processes, but at much faster coating rates and lower cost. In the SPPS approach, a liquid chemical precursor, containing the desired cations, is atomized into the plasma jet. The injected solution evaporates and the resulting chemicals are pyrolyzed, followed by melting and deposition of targeted oxides as splat of sizes less than 5 microns compared to 30-125 microns with the conventional air plasma spray process. This makes the deposition of thin, dense coatings possible. In Phase I, the feasibility of depositing thin, dense state-of-the art EBC compositions on silicon carbide substrates will be demonstrated, and preliminary durability of the coatings will be demonstrated. The deposition of EBCs with thickness less than 50 micron and with density greater than 95% will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a new low cost decision support tool to help growers optimize resources and grow more crop per drop. The company is developing extremely low cost environmental sensors that will enable growers to capture highly granular environmental data in the field and derive optimal irrigation strategies through the application of data science. Water is a major contributor to crop yields and growers struggle to deal will water scarcity and quality, coupled with variability in the soils and irrigation systems. Through the use of a data driven, closed loop decision support tool, growers will be better equipped to deal with variability, make better resource use decisions and improve crop yields. This new approach has the potential to enable growers to increase yields by as much as 15% while maintaining or reducing water use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the detection of moisture and soil texture in soils using a low cost soil moisture sensor based on magnetics. Growers rely on field data, including soil moisture, to make daily decisions that impact plant health. The most significant decision is when to apply water and in what quantity. Current approaches to detecting soil moisture (and other soil characteristics) in an automated fashion are expensive and unreliable leaving growers searching for alternatives. The objective of this project is to develop a sensitive, accurate, and reliable sensor that measures soil moisture using a novel, magnetics based approach. During the project the team will build prototype sensors, test them in lab and field environments, develop algorithms for calibrating the sensor, and explore new approaches to presenting multidimensional field data to growers in a manner that facilitates understanding and decision making.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform how substance use disorders (SUDs) are diagnosed, monitored and treated by creating an integrated technology platform for health care providers. One important application is the early detection of risky substance use behavior that, if treated in the beginning stages, will reduce the rate of fully developed SUDs. The research and development performed on this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be key to creating a novel bio-sensor based approach to diagnosing, monitoring and treating substance abuse patients.  The collected bio-sensor data can also inform treatment solutions to help address this tremendous problem, which affects millions of people, costs the US economy billions of dollars annually, and incurs a significant human cost in terms of lost lives, broken families, and unfulfilled potential.  There is also strong demand for a robust solution in places where substance use detection and monitoring is mandated for safety reasons, including the court system and the military services, as well as occupations like air traffic controllers, pilots, train operators, truck drivers, bus drivers, and operators of heavy machinery.

    The proposed project will focus on integrating biosensors with smartphone technology to detect, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata and to push resulting behavior change instructions to the user. By establishing a connection between the sensors and a smartphone application we will report substance abuse treatment outcome data much more accurately than is currently possible via self-reporting.  This system will address engineering, manufacturing, and calibration challenges of a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This technology bypasses the limitations of existing methods with a dramatically different approach. The technology aims to greatly simplify the process of SUD diagnosis and treatment by empowering health care providers to implement accurate data collection, early detection, and custom-tailored intervention within the context of any routine office visit.  The proposed project will address the development of a substance use measuring biosensor and assess the sensor lifetime, stability, reproducibility, and sensitivity.  It is intended to develop a biosensor that patients can wear for a period of time, that we can establish a meaningful connection between the sensor and the mobile application to replace self-reporting, and that concept support can be gained from broader representation of primary care physicians and major insurance companies

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to address the grand challenge of human-induced nitrogen loading to the environment. An easy-to-use and affordable system will target a major source of nitrogen releases to watersheds: the on-site systems that treat wastewater from millions of households and commercial facilities across the U.S.  The need to mitigate harmful algal blooms and prevent other damaging cumulative effects to aquatic ecosystems have created an urgent demand for onsite technologies that remove nitrogen at its source. The proposed nitrogen removal technology is modular and adaptable for use in small-scale systems that treat wastewater from individual homes, community systems and commercial establishments. The project employs an innovative biological nitrogen removal process that that will be verified and optimized for high priority applications in rural, peri-urban, and urban settings. The system is mechanically simple, generates no waste products, and operates passively with minimal maintenance, energy or consumables.  The results from this project will help to solve the critical challenge of nitrogen control by providing a highly efficient, low-cost, commercializable system that is practicable for on-site wastewater treatment in new and retrofit systems.

    The technical objectives of this Phase I research project are to design, construct, field-test, and critically evaluate variant prototypes of an innovative bioreactor system to remove nitrogen from onsite wastewater.  Prototype bioreactors will be operated and monitored over multiple months to investigate their salient operational characteristics and define effective design and treatment regimes.  The bioreactors will be installed to treat real household wastewater under field conditions.  Nitrogen analytes will be monitored across the bioreactor systems to delineate the effects of biotreatment on four nitrogen species: organic nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite.  The effects of the biotreatment system on chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, inorganic chemical parameters, and other wastewater constituents of interest will also be elucidated.  The project will critically evaluate the effectiveness of total nitrogen removal and the stability and resiliency of individual nitrogen removal transformations.  The work will confirm the longevity and robustness of the nitrogen removal process and identify design and operating parameters that optimize an innovative approach to remove total nitrogen from on-site wastewater while mitigating nitrogen releases to the environment.  Prototype design and monitoring will facilitate scale-up of results to full-scale biotreatment systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is cost-effective, eco-friendly membranes that significantly benefit fossil-fuel power plants and gas separation technologies by reducing energy consumption and membrane cost. The proposed disruptive technology has a direct impact on one of our key centennial societal challenges, i.e. reducing greenhouse gas emissions by separating and capturing carbon dioxide. This project will help enable new approaches for manufacturing new cost-effective, high performance, and durable membranes with wide applicability due to the abundance of the raw materials and ease of manufacturing processes. Broadly, the project can impact various separation technologies such as separation and storage of hydrogen for fuel cells, water desalination and filtration, and separation of biomolecules and radioactive waste.

    The technical objective in this Phase I research project is developing a facile but disruptive technology to synthesize novel nanoporous membrane products capable of efficient separation of CO2 gas molecules from fossil-fuel power plants. The core technology relies on coupling size-exclusion separation mechanisms and affinity-based adsorption to provide superior performance. The proposed novel technology will mitigate the existing challenges in current membrane technologies such as high-temperature instability, low-flux, high-cost, and manufacturing difficulties. The final membrane product can be employed by various energy sectors and industrial gases and will provide a low-cost solution that is more energy-efficient, durable, and demonstrates exceptional CO2 selectivity, as compared to existing technologies.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the clinical success of spinal and
    orthopedic implants to keep more Americans healthy and active.  Our focus is to
    enhance properties of a widely used implant material made of a polymer. As a hard
    plastic, it is beneficial for strength but unfavorable for integrating with surrounding
    tissue. As a result, a high percentage of polymer implants loosen because they
    do not integrate well with bone.  Our innovation expands scientific and technical
    understanding by investigating a novel nano-engineered surface coating for polymer
    implants.  The outcome of this proposal could be a revolutionary implant surface
    with rapid healing, sound integration, and lowered risk of implant failures. Surgeons
    could have higher success rates and save on operating time. Patients could have
    fewer complications.  Insurers could pay less for procedures.  Manufacturers could
    offer a superior technology. This novel surface technology will be applied to
    spinal implants first and then expanded into craniofacial, trauma, sports medicine,
    hip, knee, and extremities applications. Our goal is to bring this technology

    techniques for creating nano-engineered surfaces on polymer substrates (Objective
    1). Next, we will validate with advanced imaging techniques the presence of the
    nano-engineered structures on the implant surface (Objective 2). The anticipated
    outcome will be a novel surface coating with a nanostructure that has superior
    material attributes on the macro, micro and nano levels. Extensive material characterization
    will validate the procedure. Successful development of fabrication methods will
    lead to mechanical testing (Objective 3). The novelty of this nano-engineered

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes a significant impact on the electric power contingency analysis conducted by industries around the globe. The proposed algorithm can be used by power system planning units, operators, utility companies, universities, and research centers and provides designers, engineers, and scientists with the opportunity of a considerable reduction in computation efforts in performing power grid dynamic simulations, especially in the grids with high penetration of renewable and small-scale generators. It allows conducting more studies in shorter time and leads to significant personnel and equipment cost reduction. In addition, the proposed algorithm is a significant step forward towards realizing a real-time power system analyzer, which can be used to alleviate the adverse effects of faults and disturbances in small and large electric power systems.  Thus, the proposed algorithm potentially helps enhance modern power system reliability and resiliency by providing a fast and accurate analysis of the system under various possible contingencies. As the power grid is one of the most important and fundamental infrastructures in each society, the proposed project will directly enhance social welfare.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a software program for dynamic analysis of power grids. In electric power industries, grid simulators are vital tools to evaluate and analyze dynamic behavior of the grid. Power grids are large-scale networks that are mathematically modeled by thousands of variables and equations. Analysis of such a large number of variables and equations is very time-consuming. Integration of intermittent renewable energy resources as well as small-scale low-inertia generators to modern power grids make the network analysis even more challenging. In the proposed algorithm (to become a software program) a novel mathematical solver is proposed that significantly reduces the computations required to solve the well-known differential-algebraic equations describing power systems. The proposed algorithm contributes to the reduction of the size of the Jacobian matrix and removal of the error loop in the power grid dynamic simulations. These improvements significantly increase the speed of the proposed software program in analyzing dynamic behavior of power grids when compared to the available methods. Preliminary studies show that the proposed power grid simulator can perform at least 30 times faster than the standard Newton-Raphson algorithm when simulating large grids with significant number of generators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is through the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for concentrated solar power plants that would make solar power an economical and viable source of renewable energy for mass consumption. With the worldwide growing need for energy, alternative sources of energy have been the primary focus of research over the past few decades. Molten salt heat transfer fluid used in concentrated solar power plants are one sub-area of such research. Molten salts have excellent stability at high temperature (>650C) and can be mined and easily manufactured into solar heat transfer fluids at a reasonable cost.  Additionally, the developed molten salt heat transfer fluid would increase the efficiency of energy generation in solar power plants and provide potential cost savings  by utilizing ubiquitous economical metals such as stainless steel. The heat transfer fluid could potentially  bring the subsidy-free installed system price at the utility scale to a competitive price of 5-6 cents per kilowatt-hour.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to (i) develop a fundamental understanding of interfacial corrosion of 316L stainless steel in molten chloride salt compositions and (ii) inhibit this corrosion by utilizing suitable additives. It is known that chloride salts could potentially increase the operating temperatures (to 900 Celcius) and hence enhance the energy efficiency of solar power plants. However, the extreme corrosive behavior of molten chlorides towards the stainless steel pipes utilized in solar plants has prevented their usage for practical applications. With the fundamental corrosion insight gained through this research project, Dynalene intends to develop proprietary inhibitor compositions that can be added to the chloride salt in-situ during the operation of a solar power plant. These additives would minimize corrosion by forming a continuous  and inert ceramic layer at the operating temperature on the stainless steel surface, and simultaneo usly strengthen the grain boundaries. Dynalene had some initial success in growing a few micron-thick inert, continuous  ceramic layer on a stainless  steel surface. In this project, Dynalene  will  develop a corrosion package that would reduce dechromatization in steel and restrict the corrosion rate of 316L stainless  steel to 10 micro-meters/year

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project extends to academics and industry stakeholders holding intellectual or financial interests that are impacted by climate change. Given growing evidence for climate change-driven increases in extreme weather events over recent years, it has become increasingly important for stakeholders to factor climate change into their resilience plans. Engineering firms must embed changes in risks into engineering design processes due to increased urbanization, coastal inhabitancy, and climate change impacts. Insurance companies need to base risk assessments, underwriting strategies, and reinsurance purchasing decisions on quantitative methods that appropriately consider credible, probabilistic projections of changes in extremes with appropriate uncertainty bounds. Public agencies, municipalities, and private organizations must implement resilience strategies for critical infrastructure that will withstand climate extremes at decadal to multidecadal scales. This project focuses on developing and translating patent-protected research to analytics and products that address the emerging needs of these industry stakeholders. The publications and software developed via this proposal will significantly advance best practices in hazard risk assessment and climate change adaptation, and a sample of the New England design storm curves will be made freely available to support educational and outreach efforts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the deep uncertainties in climate projections rooting from intrinsic variability and longstanding gaps in physics understanding. The project will consist of developing a Physics-Guided Statistical Modeling (PGSM) framework for probabilistically quantifying projected changes in regional precipitation extremes, and translating those projections to actionable, climate change-informed local design storm curves. The initial focus is on precipitation extremes given that theory and evidence suggest climate change-driven increases in storm severity in many regions, that these projections are needed to enhance design curves, and given they are crucial inputs to flood models that will be pursued aggressively in subsequent efforts. The project will culminate in multiple deliverables, including (1) peer reviewed scientific publications, (2) a proprietary spatio-temporal precipitation extremes database, and (3) design storm curves for a New England testbed, the last of which will be disseminated via a software prototype.

    Research Phase I project is the creation of technology that uses sound waves to
    separate small particles by size with a level of effectiveness that far surpasses
    what is currently available commercially.  Such particle size control is important
    for enhancing the efficiency of separation techniques such as chromatography.
    \ Chromatography is broadly used in science and manufacturing to separate components

    both industrial, pharmaceutical and biomedical. \n\n The technical objectives
    in this Phase I research project are the development of a novel high-flow, two-stage
    acoustic fractionation technology.  Acoustic concentration in a flow stream using
    pressure to force cells and particles across a flow has been well established.
    \ Current systems generate sufficient acoustic force to concentrate biological
    cells and small particles by establishing an ultrasonic standing wave between
    transmitters and reflectors that are tens to hundreds of microns apart.  These
    dimensions of a small channel in the systems limit the sample flow rate to hundreds
    of microliters per minute.  The proposed R&D will employ novel proprietary technology
    developed by Acoustic Biosystems for producing a single planar acoustic node in
    a wide rectangular channel.  The rectangular flow cross section supports high
    sample flow rates through the resonant acoustic waves.  The envisioned acoustic
    fractionation technology will use two precisely aligned acoustic pressure nodes
    within a fluid laminar flow profile.  The first acoustic zone will align all the
    particles in the solution and the second zone will spread the particles across
    the flow by size.  Collection of slices of the laminar flow will yield narrow

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an infrastructure for exposing and interpreting a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are continuously building and shaping the world but there exists little data to examine these effects. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society specifically by improving the economic efficiency of retailers and broadly by increasing scientific understanding of how humans interact with their physical environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses a neural network and generic 3D scene reconstruction in combination with low-cost, wireless cameras to model an environment with accurate object classification and spatial relationships. Recently, neural networks have proven adept at a variety of image classification tasks but their applications in video classification, namely for human actions, have been less explored. 3D scene reconstruction has made similar advances, progressing from images to videos but has always required some prior knowledge of the physical scene. Within the past year, multiple groups have proposed methods for completely generic scene reconstruction from multiple view cameras. Finally, energy harvesting methods for devices such as cameras and wireless transmitters have been demonstrated to be feasible in laboratory experiments but have not been incorporated into commercial products. In this project the two computer vision algorithms will be developed in parallel with camera hardware so that the software and hardware systems may be integrated and demonstrated by the end of the project.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improved efficiency in labor markets by
    enabling faster, more accurate assessments of the interpersonal traits (\"soft

    for accurate automated screening interviews that can save time, effort, and money
    for both employers and job seekers - delivering a more efficient candidate selection
    process for U.S. companies and public agencies that conduct hundreds of millions
    of screening interviews with job candidates each year. This project is focused
    on performance assessments of attitude, energy and social communication, specifically
    as these qualities are needed for selection of people for cooperative roles in
    employment settings. The project's applied research will refine (and may reconceive)
    the behavioral definitions of traits that are valued in employee selection because
    they are held to be predictive of success in work settings and in occupational
    training. Resultant refined measurement tools may enable advances in applied fields
    like industrial psychology and provide more precise variables for use in basic
    studies of the neurological correlates of emotion, social perception, personality,
    and mental disorders. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase

    algorithms have estimated people's affect, sentiment, and emotions as observed
    in facial expression, text content, tone of voice, speech rate, gestures, posture
    and other body language. Among these, speech prosody, linguistic content, and
    facial expression have proven to be strong indicators of emotional valence (attitude)
    and psychomotor activation (energy level). VSI system research will identify measurable
    traits that support rapid learning and successful performance in activities and
    occupations that require teamwork or social skill.  The VSI app collects performance
    data (voice and screen-touch tracks) on mobile devices to investigate novel combinations
    of features from speech and motion that accelerate and improve trait measurement.
    The project will generate new knowledge about how the relationships between speech
    and movement can match expert evaluations of people in work groups and in social
    settings. Measurement technologies developed in the project may also be applied
    in education and industry to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of instruction

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is about empowering C program developers with correct and complex program transformation tools that they can use to not only improve the quality of C programs but also make the programs more secure against well-known vulnerabilities. C, in spite of its popularity, has integrated development environments (IDEs) with a limited portfolio of such power tools, with limited scalability and limited applicability to real-world programs. Successfully addressing the limitations present in existing tools and providing a robust program transformation infrastructure should fundamentally change how developers work on C code since refactoring is an integral part of software development practices for other programming languages. This will impact both how C programs are written and how they are maintained and evolved. The proposed work also explored behavior-enhancing program transformations that can fix security vulnerabilities in C programs. The work on behavior-enhancing transformations should open a new paradigm of power tools that can be made available to programmers in general (not limited to C programmers).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will foster the development of new algorithms and data structures needed to implement scalable, robust automated program transformation tools for C. It will focus on the parts of this problem that have been inadequately addressed in prior work - specifically, sound handling of the C preprocessor and deep program analysis. At the same time, the work will address the heterogeneity of C platforms, e.g., different dialects, different configurations based on underlying hardware, different IDEs, etc. The Principle Investigator led an NSF-supported research effort to address the research problems in the last three years and has developed a large research prototype (over 500 KLOC). The proposed work brings many of the research results to practice.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of mobile applications by providing developers with better tools for quality assurance of such applications. The results from these tools will enable the developers to take actionable steps to improve and evolve their applications before releasing to customers. This process will also increase developers' confidence in the reliability of their app and will allow them to ship high-quality apps faster. As a result, the average mobile user will have a better mobile experience, thus benefiting all segments of society that rely on mobile computing for their daily activities. From a research perspective, the proposed project will help us understand the practical issues in effectively applying and scaling test generation for mobile applications. Based on the findings, the company will define improved techniques to address such issues and disseminate its results broadly through publications and interactions with industry. Finally, the work will positively influence the next generation of mobile computing development tools by making automated testing more integrated with the development process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project directly addresses the stated goals of the "Information Technologies" topic; it promises to provide fundamental scientific advances by developing both solid theoretical foundations and practical tools that help in improving the functionality and performance of mobile software. Bugs in mobile applications are dependent on the multiple contexts such as user, location, platform etc., leading to several challenges in testing under realistic user conditions. Thus, despite recent research advances in software engineering, app testing is still done by humans, resulting in a tedious and error prone process. This project will lead to the development of novel techniques and a tool (product) that enables, supports and automates the generation of test cases for mobile applications under various conditions. Upon completion, this project will provide unprecedented advantages to developers for reducing their testing costs while effectively finding and addressing app issues. The results of the company's preliminary evaluation are encouraging and motivate further research and development in this area. The company will leverage relationships built during its initial customer discovery to empirically validate the proposed techniques on real world mobile applications.

    This SBIR Phase I Project explores the approach of teaching fundamental engineering concepts through engaging gameplay using a proprietary platform. The platform consists of tiles that can be put together in different ways in 3 dimensions, acting as an input to a game. The game is implemented on a paired device that can be on a tablet or a computer. The player will be presented increasingly difficult challenges and puzzles within game, and will have to use the physical tiles to assist in constructing the solution. The field of engineering exists in 3 dimensions, and the proposed project aims to explore building the intuition of this field within our youngest learners. The broader impact is in the vision for the platform to exist as a means to introduce different STEM topics in a fun and engaging manner, creating fond memories that could lead to more children with an interest in pursuing STEM related fields in the future. The project also has a mission to remain gender neutral in its design, so as to provide games that foster interest in both girls and boys.

    This SBIR Phase I Project will explore, through the use of near field communications, the extension of a proprietary platform that can read and construct data in 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. There is a given theoretical limit to which near field communications are viable, and this project will explore optimizations and additions to the current proprietary solution to achieve a communications distance closer to the theoretical limit. The proprietary system is highly compact, and the project will be researching ways to prevent self interference while improving the range of the system. The main explorations include a look at optimizing off-the-shelf near field communications inlay designs, optimizing the current antenna design and network, and the potential addition of a signal amplifier to boost the range of the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a tool to accelerate the discovery of new autoantibody biomarkers for the early detection and personalized treatment of human diseases.  Autoantibody biomarkers are broadly used to diagnose a variety of conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases and cancers. However, the limited reproducibility, cost and sensitivity of current autoantibody profiling methods frustrate the discovery of new biomarkers to improve management of these diseases. A cost-effective autoantibody profiling platform that is highly sensitive and robust could reveal changes in the autoantibody repertoire that might have been missed by current methods. Such a tool would serve as an invaluable pipeline for the discovery of new biomarkers, augmenting the ability to detect, treat and understand numerous diseases. In the $7.4 Billion/yr biomarker discovery array market, the proposed tool, sold as a service or as micro-arrays kits for client use, meets must-have needs of several customers, including biopharmaceutical companies seeking for new disease targets, improving clinical trials and academic groups pursuing better understanding of human biology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a highly multiplexed and sensitive autoantibody biomarker profiling tool to expedite biomarker discovery. The proposed approach uses agglutination-PCR, a novel technique developed at UC Berkeley and Stanford.  Agglutination-PCR detects autoantibodies in the solution-phase to ensure proper folding of antigen probes while leveraging the sensitivity and multiplex power of standard qPCR instruments. This project employs an innovative synthetic strategy to prepare and optimize a large panel of probes at low cost. While a traditional synthetic route would take up to 3 months, the proposed strategy could reduce the time down to one week. In addition, the probe library for autoantibody detection will be validated using banked serum/plasma from healthy patients or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This experiment will serve as a powerful proof-of-principle, as SLE displays many distinct autoantibodies that are challenging to detect with other methods. The analytical sensitivity and reproducibility of the proposed product will be compared to standard protein microarrays. The platform will be tested to ensure reproducibility and ease-of-use. The probe library and protocols will function as a minimum viable product and the prototype for applications in other diseases.

    evidence shows that vaccines are effective in preventing infectious diseases such
    as influenza, a contagious respiratory illness. However, despite CDC's recommendation
    for universal influenza vaccination, fewer than 50% of all children in the US,
    and only 1 in 3 of African-American children, are vaccinated each year. The proposed
    activities are designed to educate kids and parents about the benefits of vaccinations,
    in order to increase the number of vaccinated children. Through a tag game and
    wearable devices, participants simulate transmission of influenza, and thereby
    better visualize the health risks of going unvaccinated. The long-term goal is
    to improve the health literacy of young students in a fun and exciting way. Educating
    children about health concepts promotes healthy behaviors, and leads families
    toward better health-related decisions. Improving health literacy, especially
    in a technology-oriented society, is key to developing a thriving population that
    can understand and use new information. The commercial outcome of the proposed
    SBIR project will lead to a marketable product that will be targeted toward hands-on

    technology in this project will engage children in modeling scientific phenomena
    in a fun and exciting way, while at the same time help them to better understand
    such phenomena. The system uses smartwatches for managing tag games that educate
    children about the benefits of vaccination against influenza. Each participant
    is assigned a health status, such as infectious, healthy, or immune, and then
    runs around to simulate the spread of the flu. Through these participation-based
    activities, students will develop better understandings of the underlying concepts
    of infectious disease transmission, community-level (herd) immunity, and disease
    outbreaks. Similar activities can be used to teach other scientific phenomena
    such as chemical reactions and phase changes. The project will evaluate the effectiveness
    of activities using systematic surveys producing feedback from participants. This
    work fills a market need for educational technology tools that provide powerful
    and memorable learning experiences that not only improve health literacy but also
    foster student interest and confidence in science and math. Educating children
    by exposing them to the sciences, especially in health-related areas, is essential
    to improving wellbeing, and aligns with NSF?s mission of promoting science education."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a 3-dimensional (3D) culture well plate to be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) tool for research and drug discovery.  The core technology is a novel well plate that incorporates micron-meter-sized channels and compartments, and will have the ability to perform autonomous media exchange and drug loading non-invasively in an automated and high-speed fashion. The well plate will allow larger libraries of potential drug candidate compounds to be screened against 3D cultured cells. This would enable pharmaceutical companies and screening centers to increase the probability of finding new drug candidates by elevating the scale and throughput necessary for their discovery and validation. The technology also will increase scientific understanding of cells by providing a tool to study their behavior in an in vivo-like environment, which is important when studying tumor spheroids and exploring cancer therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a 3D cell culture tool by integrating novel microfluidic technology into a well plate format. 3D cell culture is emerging as the next generation drug screening method, as it provides a window into cellular responses by culturing and studying cells in an in vivo-like environment. Currently, however, there are no tools available in the market for testing 3D cultured cells against drug compounds in an HTS fashion. A prototype of the well plate will be fabricated and several important parameters that are required to conduct HTS studies on tumors will be studied. Parameters such as the uniformity in culturing 3D tumors, volume of media required for healthy cellular growth, and effectiveness of the plate to perform screening of drug compounds will be determined. It is anticipated that the microfluidic well plate will create a uniform number of tumors in each microfluidic well and produce results similar to those derived from the current state of the art 3D cell culture platforms. Proprietary patented microfluidic technology developed and verified during the SBIR Phase I project will help integrate 3D cell culture into the mainstream drug discovery cascade.

- abstractText: "This SBIR phase I project will create a web-based platform for developing
    and distributing interactive, mobile-enabled games for Information and Operations
    Management. Each of these games will illustrate one to two fundamental academic
    concepts by having students engage in short, round-based interactions that last
    less than one classroom session. Recent studies (Burke, 2012; Sitzmann, 2011),
    show that educational games, which focus on key concepts and provide immediate
    feedback to players, help students understand, learn and internalize fundamental
    academic concepts. The project addresses widespread obstacles reported by professors
    to incorporate games into their teaching, including the scarcity of games that
    were both relevant and technically capable in classroom environments. The broader
    impact of the proposed project is an increase in the adoption of pedagogically
    and academically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective
    use of business concepts relevant to managing organizations. Hence, this proposal
    has potential to empower the workforce to be more productive and innovative, thus
    driving U.S. economic growth. Moreover, the eventual opening of the platform to
    a variety of third-party authors will accelerate game innovation and usage in
    other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will enhance
    the effectiveness of a broader STEM workforce.\n \n\nThis project will employ
    automatically validated language to eliminate runtime errors in multiplayer Operations
    Management games, which will have been designed using a scientific Game Research
    & Development (GR&D) process for hosting on a web-distribution platform. Debugging
    runtime errors presents a particular challenge for non-professional programmers,
    such as professors. With runtime errors mitigated, the correctness of a program
    can be validated at compile time. Therefore, all games created with the project
    Game Description Language (GDL) will have a guaranteed level of technical quality
    and stability, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance rather than
    technical stability of games. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this
    project employs methods of mainstream video game development, which relies heavily
    on non-professional programmers for storyline scripting. The main technical hurdle
    is that these methods must be tailored to result in automatically validated language
    capable of expressing the range of Operations Management games conceived during
    the GR&D process. The goal of the proposed R&D is a platform prototype able to
    support 10 simultaneous users of four games implemented using the GDL. Pilot tests
    with users will assess critical usability metrics to facilitate further, larger-scale
    testing and GDL improvements in Phase II."

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  A Systematic Approach, Language and Platform for Building
    and Distributing Interactive Educational Games in Operations Management'
- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning
    Assistant (VLA) technology for constructed response assessment. The best pedagogies
    responsible for improving learning outcomes generally involve (i) constructed
    response assessments and (ii) one-to-one tutoring. Students learn the best when
    they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words (instead
    of selecting from multiple choices) and when they receive immediate guidance and
    coaching in a one-to-one conversation with a human tutor. However, the costs and
    time associated with the constructed response assessment and one-to-one tutoring
    are significant, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will
    apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural
    Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the
    interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation.
    This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education,
    and adult learning and across the subjects areas such as English language arts,
    STEM and humanities. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic
    standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve
    students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering
    high quality engaging education on a large scale. \n\nThis project will create
    a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education.
    The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational
    AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments
    for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose
    virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an answer instead of merely serving
    information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing
    natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects
    or topics. The resulting web based product will allow teachers to create new high
    quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students.
    When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic
    syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations.
    The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the
    answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual
    mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase I research, a pilot study will be
    conducted involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and
    to verify its usability and feasibility."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from technology that automatically analyzes network configurations for errors. Computer networks are so tightly woven into the fabric of modern business and society that the delivery of almost all products and services relies on them. Yet networks are notoriously difficult to manage correctly today, and configuration errors that compromise availability, security, and performance are common. Today operators are left to simply wait for bad things to happen and then diagnose and repair the errors as quickly as possible to mitigate the damage. The technology developed in this project will enable organizations to identify network security and availability errors before they are introduced into the running network, thereby saving significant time and money, preventing unauthorized access to customer information, and minimizing down time.  The project will also lead to a better understanding of the most prevalent kinds of network configuration errors and how to design networks to prevent them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will perform the research and development necessary to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a proactive approach to detecting network configuration errors, as instantiated in a software tool. The key innovation underlying the approach is the ability to comprehensively and precisely model and validate the behavior of a network solely by analyzing the network's configuration files. The proposed work has three primary technical goals.  First, configuration languages are extremely diverse and complex, so the tool currently only supports features that have been used by the networks to which it has been applied. A key challenge is to augment the logical model underlying the tool to support other features that are used by real-world networks.  Second, the tool is currently computationally expensive for large networks. Scalability will be improved by leveraging the structure inherent in network configurations and topologies to perform configuration analysis modularly.  Third, to be usable by network operators, the tool must integrate with existing source-control repositories and must provide an expressive interface enabling operators to explore the analysis results.  In summary, these research directions will turn the software tool from a research prototype into an expressive, scalable, and usable tool for analyzing real networks.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will close the gap between the hospital and home
    for proper asthma care. The greatest hurdles for proper lung assessment are costly
    devices ranging from $1000 to $30,000, and mandatory oversight from a skilled
    lab technician to ensure proper use. These hospital lung function tests allow
    for early detection of declining lung performance up to several days in advance
    of visible symptoms like coughing or wheezing, but no option for reliable assessment
    in the home currently exists. The proposed technology incorporates machine learning
    into an easy to use mobile-app that replicates a trained lab technician's coaching.
    In combination with an affordable consumer device that measures lung function,
    the technology makes proper lung assessment accessible outside the hospital, for
    regular tracking between office visits supported with physician-guided suggestions
    for reducing unnecessary and costly emergency visits and hospitalizations.\n \nThe
    proposed project offers a preventative care solution for 10 million children with
    asthma in the US alone. This solution entails an engaging mobile-app game controlled
    by a handheld device that measures lung capacity, which together provide parents
    with an action plan to prevent their child?s asthma symptoms before they occur.
    Guidelines will be developed in consultation with pediatric pulmonologists to
    gain results as reliable as tests conducted under the guidance of a respiratory
    therapist in the hospital. A large database of expert labeled lung measurements
    will be used to train and test the neural network model to detect and decipher
    feature patterns and correlations. If imprecise information is collected, the
    app's machine-learned algorithm will determine the cause of failure and suggest
    a corrective action for the next attempt. This ensures that only properly collected
    lung measurements trigger recommendations for action. By the end of this proposal
    period, the applicant will have a machine learning algorithm on a mobile-app that
    matches the efficacy of in-person coaching by a trained lab technician, as well
    as evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technology for Phase II considerations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the areas of risk management, data collection, and participation/growth in the agricultural sector. With the proposed platform, individuals with investment capital will be paired with individuals who have access to infrastructure and management expertise. This will allow small-scale farmers to invest in other farmers to diversify their operations, creating a more reliable income stream and consequently increasing the stability and resilience of small farms, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. Incentivizing these farmers to upload data to improve projection accuracy will result in more robust datasets that can be used to compare and optimize farming practices. The micro-consortia that will be formed will reduce barriers to entry in the agricultural sector by facilitating remote transactions, contracts, and management. This platform could eventually help farmers in developing countries produce agricultural goods with the financial help and expertise of more established farms in the developed world. By increasing participation in agriculture and improving upon current farming practices around the world, this platform can help feed the world's growing population for years to come.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to generate better agricultural decision making and implementation tools by improving upon existing data sets. Massive amounts of data are being collected by farming operations, but that data is often difficult to manage. This project can help farmers utilize this information by providing visual tools to make advanced data analysis and decision-making more intuitive and user-friendly. The feasibility depends on developing an accurate decision support system as well as providing actionable recommendations to incentivize the use of the tools. The goal of the project is to develop the main simulation tool for a decision support platform, along with easy-to-understand visualizations of different investment projections and their impact on income. Finally, users will be given the ability to act upon the recommendations from the analysis immediately and directly from the analysis platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable data-intensive engineering and science organizations to enhance their data transfer speeds without having to administer premature, costly, and disruptive network upgrades. In addition, the findings and results from this project shed a much needed light to the members of data-intensive communities (both commercial and research) regarding the importance of treating data movement as the 4th critical IT dimension, besides the traditional three: storage, compute, and networking. Furthermore, the project's outcome will show that the 4th-dimension must be defined by balanced interactions of the first three to achieve a desired data transfer speed - an important and elusive concept to grasp, but critical in using high-speed digital communications cost-effectively. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, the product resulting from this project will be far more scalable, space and energy efficient, cost-effective, and easy to deploy and use. Finally, the product will demonstrate that it can meet the data transfer needs of major scientific and commercial endeavors of this decade. This should foster accelerated progress in science and engineering, and thus also the overall national economic health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need in modern distributed data-intensive engineering and science operations for a 4th IT dimension - data movement - besides storage, compute, and networking. To match the exponential data-growth trend, the product resulting from this project will provide high-performance data transfer and encryption. The design balances and scales in: IOPS, computation power, and network interfaces. It has a cluster-oriented architecture, using peer-to-peer technologies to ease deployment, operation, and usage. Two patent-pending algorithms help tackle data sets containing a mix of small files and very large files, and provide insensitivity to network latency. Its unique optimizations enable effective use of flash storage. The project will develop a simple, effective, and scale-out capable storage tiering software, a scale-out high-speed data encryption approach, and a scale-out approach for implementing more efficient storage I/O intensive applications. It is anticipated that data rates between two existing Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) front ending parallel data file systems will be comparable with those from two commonly used high performance data transfer applications. With two four-node clusters, the product is anticipated to achieve 155Gbps memory-to-memory over a 16x10Gbps aggregated link and 70Gbps file-to-file with encryption over a 5000 mile 100Gbps link.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a technology called luminescent solar concentration that will extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized yet because previous tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project aims to provide a solutions to these problems with a novel low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on discovering new improvements in efficiency and cost reduction of the quantum dots. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned coal needed to generate electricity.


    The technical innovation in this project is the development of an ideal window-tint material that will be used to transform windows into electricity generating components of urban buildings. Luminescent solar concentrators are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like photoluminescent dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots, which are interesting due to their easily tunable light emission, are more stable, but are expensive, toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimized for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. In this SBIR Phase I project CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots will be optimized for higher photoluminescence efficiency >50% and applied as industry-compatible coatings to glass substrates for higher performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will arise from the development and release of the world's first open source Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) platform. The platform will be made available to the world as open source software free of charge, and will be surrounded by a set of commercial offerings that include the deployment and customization of the software as well as software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings that will allow users of the platform to painlessly create and deploy IVAs. Beyond the commercial applications of IVA technology, the open source release of the platform will help foster a healthy, active open source community around the IVA technology, allowing it to be leveraged as a machine learning research platform and accelerating IVA adoption in important non-commercial settings such as non-profit education and improving technological access for the disabled.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the significant computer systems challenges involved in seamlessly orchestrating the massive amounts of computation among complex pipelines of algorithmic components required to power intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) technologies. The computation required to power IVAs is large enough that such software systems will likely run in large datacenter infrastructures comprised of complex ecosystems of different server types and accelerator platforms. This project will address these challenges by building a centralized software mechanism within the IVA platform for monitoring job execution to facilitate efficiently mapping sub-tasks within the IVA computation to the available hardware resources in the datacenter.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project is designed to address the dramatic drop
    in US student proficiency happening in the middle school grades. Seen across years
    of international test data, this drop highlights the urgent need to prepare students
    for success in the math classroom. Without a solid foundation in math, US students
    cannot succeed in science, technology and engineering. They will be less likely
    to graduate high school, will struggle to succeed in college, and are at risk
    of being left behind in a global economy. Many look to technology to address this
    challenge - but the 22 million US students struggling in mathematics do not need
    yet another virtual tutorial, online lecture or more practice time on a computer
    doing textbook-based math problems. What they need is a simulator. A comprehensive
    simulator where they can see, hear and experience just how math works - and why
    it matters. This project would develop an innovative product that delivers interactive
    video challenge math problems, aligned to Common Core State Standards for 5th
    through 8th grade mathematics, into any classroom. \n\nThis product will use a
    complex programming system and codebase to allow teachers to collect student data
    and responses to complex math problems that result in functional output, accepting
    rapid real-time responses from multiple student devices, that can range from computers
    to mobile phones, in a low-bandwidth environment. Within the product, teachers
    generate tasks and challenges for students; students would grapple with multi-step
    problems and provide answers, with the teacher maintaining ultimate control over
    what is  shared out with the classroom as a whole when the simulation is played
    out. Student data and responses are captured and are connected directly to a robust
    learning management system. The product is anticipated to be highly effective
    by providing students with an opportunity for Productive Failure (PF) prior to
    instruction; PF shows a higher effect size for both conceptual learning and transfer
    to novel situations than typical approaches where instruction is provided first.
    The Phase I project will conduct preliminary research using an experimental design
    to determine effect size of student growth from use of the intervention on a single
    CCSS standard."

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a cloud-based E-Learning platform providing hands-on labs and personalized learning support for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.  Hands-on labs have become an indispensable part of curriculum components for STEM education. There is a high demand for students to practice real-world problems through hands-on labs; moreover, hands-on labs should provide adaptive and personalized learning capability for students to adjust their learning paths and contents to achieve desired study outcomes more effectively. However, the main issues of providing hands-on labs are in two-fold: (1) high lab management overhead for instructors; and (2) lack of user-behavior learning models that can be used for personalized learning in an experimental setup. In this SBIR Phase I project, we will develop a platform providing a cloud-based virtual laboratory solution that minimizes the lab management overhead, and tracks users' hands-on learning behavior to provide personalized learning support in order to improve students' learning outcomes. The presented solution will have great impacts for a broader population from K-12 to higher education.

    The novelty of the proposed research lies in the technology innovations by conducting research in the following areas: (1) a Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based approach to support Private Network and Network Security as a Service (PNaaS and NSaaS) model for cloud resource provisioning in a highly dynamic virtualized learning environment; (2) a pure web-based service model to guide students' lab experiments based on cybersecurity knowledge bases and concept maps; (3) learning behavior tracking and modeling to collect and represent students' diverse learning activities for cybersecurity learning based on ICAP (Interactive, Constructive, Active and Passive) features which describe student?s cognitive engagement to discern different levels of engagement as overt behaviors; and (4) build-in self-assessment services to measure users' learning outcomes. The research goal of this SBIR I project will address the challenges on how to create a scalable E-Learning environment to provide resources (computing, storage, networking, education contents, and personalized learning guidance) to a large number of learners and educators who have different system resources and learning setup requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance societal goals such as protection of life and property, protection against lost revenue and improved planning by providing a technically innovative product to help operational forecasters create better weather forecasts. The explosive growth in the availability of high-performance computing clusters has significantly increased the amount of forecast data available to operational meteorologists. Making sense of all of the available data in a timely fashion has become difficult and the market exists for products that streamline this process. Any improvement in weather forecasting will have direct and indirect positive effects for businesses and society by increasing safety, helping in daily and weekly planning, helping to mitigate storm related expenses and helping businesses avoid weather-related expenses that can then trickle down as cost-savings for the customer. The technology will allow forecasters to produce better forecasts more quickly and will be valuable in operational settings at national weather centers, to individual users, and in a host of commercial applications such as energy, agriculture, and media.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of operationally synthesizing multiple streams of global, regional, and ensemble weather model forecast data in real-time to provide a streamlined product of model performance and then use that information to create new global or regional forecast maps. The complexity of accessing and analyzing vast amounts of forecast data creates a significant challenge to the operational forecaster. Analysis of all available forecast data is difficult since forecasters are under pressure to process the data in a short amount of time. Furthermore, the analysis is usually subjective. The proposed technology will ameliorate these issues by creating a model performance and forecast product that consolidates a majority of forecast data into one, easy-to-use interface. The goal of the project is to provide operational forecasters with a tool that gives an objective look at model performance with minimal effort and provides them with a new forecast product that is better than any single model.

    This SBIR Phase I project will enable a high-performance, large particle size silicon anode for integration in SiILion's proprietary high energy Li-ion system. While rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the portable electronics market for nearly a decade, they have failed to gain widespread commercial success in high power and high capacity applications due to material limitations. Demand for a battery providing 400 Wh/kg, 700 Wh/L (almost double the specific energy of current state-of-the art lithium-ion batteries) is growing. Reaching the performance demands of next-generation Li-ion batteries will require breakthroughs in next-generation electrode materials. If successful in enabling its proposed 900 Wh/L technology, SiILion could offer the public an opportunity to own an affordable, safe, environmentally conscious vehicle while also providing safe, high energy batteries for applications ranging from consumer electronics to grid storage. Moreover, SiILion's high energy battery technology has major implications in the aerospace and defense industries, providing a non-flammable battery for vehicular and on-person applications. In the race to develop the next successful Li-ion technology, the U.S. economy stands to gain; SiILion's proposed Li-ion battery system provides an opportunity for the U.S. to own high impact battery technology and reclaim a leadership position in the Li-ion market.

    Most research aimed towards enabling next-generation electrode materials, both in academia and industry, focuses on expensive material modification. Conversely, SiILion is working to enable low-cost and scalable electrode materials using a new class of electrolyte: room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). In order to truly realize a low-cost and scalable bulk-type Si anode, the incorporation of larger Si particles needs to be achieved. Micron-scale silicon (Micro-Si) is the ideal anode material for low cost and high capacity, but a full-cell incorporating Micro-Si has never been demonstrated commercially or in academia because of complications stemming from the material's expansion during lithiation. Upon optimizing the micron-Si anode in an RTIL electrolyte, the following areas will be investigated: (1) overall electrode thickness change upon lithiation and delithiation, (2) characterization of electrode mechanism and material morphology throughout cycling, (3) development of full-cells in a coin cell configuration, and (4) development of full-cells in a large-format configurations. This SBIR Phase I project will, for the first time demonstrate a working Micro-Si anode in a Li-ion full-cell, through the optimization of the electrode architecture and its accompanying electrolyte composition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be improved capabilities of current hearing assistive cochlear implants through the development of a miniature implantable robotic system. It will enable many more patients with hearing loss to retain their hearing capacity much longer over their lifetimes. Hearing loss has a significant impact on physical and mental health, education, employment, and overall quality of life, and has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and feelings of depression, frustration, anxiety, and social isolation. 53 million people have severe-to-profound hearing loss and are eligible for traditional cochlear implants, but there are an additional 300 million with partial-to-moderate disabling hearing loss who are not eligible for a traditional implant and do not significantly benefit from other hearing assistive devices alone. The development of this technology will enable a much wider population of those with hearing loss to receive the benefits of a cochlear implant, using a novel wireless control and the added convenience of personalized hearing loss treatment regimens. This technology will also facilitate commercial opportunities for use of the implantable robotic system in other applications where an implantable electrode/wire requires precise and dynamic remote position adjustments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop and test a prototype of an implantable robotic system that wirelessly optimizes cochlear implant function and enables clinician adjustments as patient hearing deteriorates. Though traditional cochlear implants are used to treat severe-profound hearing loss, recent advances in hearing preservation technologies have allowed those with partial hearing loss, such as from noise exposure or aging, to benefit from cochlear implants. Unfortunately, clinical trials have found that more than 50% of these recipients experience continued hearing deterioration after cochlear implantation. Treatment options are limited to additional surgery for electrode replacement or living with limited hearing because the implants cannot be adjusted. This research is focused on developing an implantable robotic control system that will enable cochlear implants to dynamically adjust to post-surgical hearing decline without the need for additional surgery. In Phase I, individual components will be assembled into a functioning implantable robotic system that meets design and surgical size requirements to effectively move an electrode within a human cadaveric cochlea model. Anticipated results will include a prototype that has a novel micromechanical system for electrode adjustments, wireless communications for external control, and safe transcutaneous power.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on furthering scientific understanding of degradation in electrochemical energy storage. The project will explore technology that will enable the large-scale transfer of a key laboratory-proven diagnostic tool from the lab to the field. This tool, called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), is a noninvasive assessment of the internal state of a battery. In contrast to current interest-group-initiated, crowd-sourced qualitative research efforts, EIS would enable the collection and analysis of an unprecedented amount of real-time quantitative data to further scientific understanding of electrochemical lifetime and degradation factors of in applications ranging from electric vehicles to grid and building storage. Highly publicized battery pack failures have increased skepticism of electrochemical energy storage in the public eye, and large-scale scientific studies could aid in faster technological improvements to increase widespread adoption of electrochemical energy storage as the U.S. seeks to improve energy independence, efficiency, and security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need to innovate on current battery management methods that force battery system overdesign and power/energy underutilization by introducing a platform to enable diagnosis and correction of inherent cell-to-cell imbalances in electric vehicles to improve battery pack performance, reliability, and safety. Specifically, this work deploys electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a distributed power electronics platform to provide a new toolset for real-time diagnostics and the improved extraction of important information to aid in the determination of battery cell state of charge and state of health. The goal of Phase I Research is to demonstrate efficient and cost-effective scalability of this power-electronics-based EIS. A proof-of-concept prototype has been verified on small-capacity cells, but a commercial solution will need to manage large-capacity cells with much lower impedance which presents control system and EIS accuracy technical challenges. A power converter and accompanying control system will first be developed to meet target specifications, followed by a demonstration board to demonstrate EIS and power management for a number of series-connected cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to address the problem of data interpretation, one of the most important and fastest growing issues caused by the influx of wearable technologies. As with all technology, wearable devices are increasing in popularity and decreasing in cost every day. Businesses rushing to catch this wave of technology paradigm are met with the complex problem of how to interpret the data gathered in a way that is accurate and useful to consumers. Many of these businesses are companies with products that were previously completely unrelated with computer or smartphone technologies. As such, they do not have the in-house expertise to not only correctly gather such data, but then analyze it for patterns that could be deemed useful in identifying behavior or conditions for the consumer. By providing a boxed solution that makes machine learning based data analysis possible for the average engineer, our project is aimed to help these businesses cross that hurdle.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project seeks to bring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems for use in the hands of non-data/computer scientists. While machine learning and AI techniques are widely used these days in many applications ranging from Google search to Uber rides, they remain fairly esoteric topics with a high learning curve just to understand, let alone apply. We plan to address this issue differently from previous competitors by building a highly intuitive web UI on top of our existing hardware sensor platform. This allows us to leverage the data gathering and processing consistency of our hardware, along with our proprietary SDKs to ensure properly labelled and clean data. As a result, we will have a much easier time developing basic digital processing filters as well as applying machine learning techniques to the data in order to solve generic classification problems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is development and application of networked medical implants. The team will conduct an in-depth feasibility study to develop a proof-of-concept prototype of an ultrasonic Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) miniaturized embedded system. Enclosed in a titanium biocompatible casing, this platform will be the basis of implantable medical devices with ultrasonic wireless connectivity and will be applied to multiple therapies in the human and veterinary spaces. Patients will benefit from implants that provide real-time wireless telemetry and reprogrammability while minimally affecting the implant battery life, therefore reducing device/battery replacements that are often complex and costly. Real-time continuous monitoring may also improve the clinical outcome for several therapies providing patients with real- time information about physiological parameters (e.g., glucose or pacemaker readings). This will reduce time-consuming and expensive in-office visits and hospitalizations. The IoMT platform will also enable the development of advanced therapies that require wireless reliable communication through tissues between multiple implantable sensing and stimulating devices. From a security perspective, the IoMT will eliminate electromagnetic compatibility concerns of a crowded radio-frequency (RF) spectrum. It is therefore safer and transparent to the RF spectrum management procedures of healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop the first proof-of-concept prototype of an ultrasonic Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform, a miniaturized, biocompatible implantable device with ultrasonic wireless communication capabilities. In the near future, wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many revolutionary therapies. However, biological tissues absorb radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves, which are the basis of wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. As a consequence, higher transmission power is needed to establish reliable links, which reduces the battery lifetime of an implantable device. The IoMT platform will offer wireless connectivity through a new and proprietary technology based on ultrasonic waves that is a safer, more secure, and lower-power alternative to RF-based technologies. The project team will conduct four research tasks to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the device: (i) explore best practices to design the core architecture of the IoMT platform; (ii) discover techniques for energy performance optimization; (iii) define best practices for powering the device; (iv) integrate and test components on a custom printed circuit board. Throughout these tasks, the team will recognize and address design tradeoffs between form factor, biocompatibility of materials, communication performance, and power consumption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed to develop, test and validate a retractable telescopic structural wall for applications in flood protection.  This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Climate change is creating a problem for coastal cities and local communities in proximity to large bodies of water. Population centers tend to be located near such bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general. The addressable market size for this technology is estimated at $2.6 billion.  The proposed concept, when validated, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. The goals of the proposed research surround the detailed design of the mechanisms, determination of a geometric configuration and material mix to achieve a high strength-to-weight ratio, and the execution of laboratory experimentation and field tests on physical working prototypes. The plan to accomplish these goals starts with the development of numerical simulations and an analytical framework. Results will be validated via laboratory tests where lateral and vertical loads, as well as impact loads, will be applied.  Field tests of the specimens will also be conducted to determine the effects of soil type on performance.  These field tests will serve as well to simulate realistic still flood water conditions.  The anticipated technical result of Phase I is a working prototype of the telescopic structural flood wall with extension and retraction capabilities, and with the structural capability to withstand the forces from flood events with minimal to no damage.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable thermal imaging solutions across a multitude of everyday applications.  More specifically, this project will make thermal imaging accessible to the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, which will spur advancements in public safety, advanced health monitoring, and energy and water conservation, all of which will further drive economic development.  Long Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) radiation propagates through common obscurants such as dust, smoke and fog, so thermal imaging cameras can enhance transportation safety under inclement conditions. For example, cameras mounted in automobiles or along railways will protect vehicle occupants and pedestrians by helping prevent collisions. The same benefits will also improve safety and increase efficacy of police, firefighters and EMTs. Finally, remotely monitored cameras will increase independence of elderly and high medical risk individuals while respecting their privacy as LWIR images preserve the anonymity of the subject.  Finally, thermal imaging-equipped smart appliances can regulate lighting and HVAC delivery based upon occupancy detection to reduce residential and commercial energy consumption. In agriculture, thermal imaging can be used in conjunction with data processing to conserve water and direct the use of pesticides and fertilizer more efficiently.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has the potential to advance the frontiers of knowledge in the areas of micro-fabrication, Long Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) optics, wafer level camera assembly, and reduced form factor thermal imaging cameras. The LWIR lens technology leverages advancements from the semiconductor and MEMS / MOEMS industries to enable never before realized lens topologies.   The lens technology pursued in this project will replace traditional germanium or chalcogenide glass lenses, which are expensive to manufacture and bulky.  The unique lens design and fabrication approach further enable Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) and Wafer-Level Optics (WLO), which extend the state-of-the-art by allowing, for the first time, the lens to be assembled on to the thermal imaging array at the wafer-level rather than at the individual die level, which results in significant reduction in cost, size and weight.  This research will involve lens design and fabrication, lens assembly on to a thermal imaging array, and finally, testing and benchmarking of the camera performance.  Finally, this project advances the study and usage of dielectric metamaterials by developing custom predictive models for using Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations as an input for traditional ray tracing optical design software.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the improvement in the quality of life for older adults currently affected by falls. Every year over 700,000 older adults are hospitalized in the United States due to fall-related injuries, which result in $34B in direct medical costs. The proposed technology will reduce first and future falls by providing an older adult's medical treatment team (e.g., physician, physical therapist, etc.) with fall history and ambulatory information.  Fall histories are difficult to obtain and unreliable (as many occurrences are not self-reported). The underlying technological development can be further expanded to allow smart buildings to behave as "first responders" and aid their occupants during man-made and natural disasters. Extensions of this technology have potential in many fields, including efficient energy management systems, security and threat detection, emergency response and evacuation, and structural health monitoring. The proposed technology respects privacy while enabling significant improvement in infrastructure intelligence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art lifestyle-monitoring system for older adults in assisted homes that has a comprehensive approach towards fall prevention and detection. The healthcare industry has invested significant resources in predicting falls based on the number of previous falls, but current healthcare professional's access to individual patient fall history is limited due to unreliable self-reporting. Additionally, research has shown that the risk of future falls can be greatly reduced through timely preventative treatments. This prevention is achieved by indirectly monitoring the physical activity and falls of older adults through floor-mounted accelerometers coupled with data analytics processing. This analysis studies inherent patterns in recorded data of events such as falls, walking, door slams, etc. Prediction is made possible through the recording of the unreported falls and health history. The anticipated output of this system is a means of detecting falls, locating them, and effective historical data storage, which will result in a more accurate future risk evaluation of the older adult.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that the model of a universal, user-facing commercially run "commons" results in an easier to use dynamic and creative Internet of Things, with more power for users and more sales for manufacturers. The commons allows devices of many protocols to publish, subscribe and react to updates from one other in a way that is open to manufacturers and visible/comprehensible to normal Internet Users. Most of the largest Internet companies (including in auctions, social media and ecommerce) constitute conceptually similar models in which a central entity helps support the relationships between consumers, or between consumers and manufacturers/sellers. This project aims to bring similar efficiencies, power and ease of use to the network-connected devices of the next few decades, with a view to capturing some of the value it creates for manufacturers and users in the process (as e-commerce, social media and auctions platforms have before).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on creating interoperability between all devices at the level of a user interface and in such a way that a normal Internet User can understand. At present, limited sub-sets of devices may be interoperable at some levels of their protocol, and may be able to react to one or extend their networks. But this interoperability does not extend to all devices, and it does not extend to the user interface. A normal person cannot make any two devices interact with one another without resorting to computer programming. The project proposes that the creation of a centralized real-time-messaging-based "commons" in which devices (i) publish their status in both human readable language and a parallel extensible data format, and (ii) can register ways for their major functions to be triggered which creates a space in which any device can react to state changes in another. The project aims to demonstrate that (i) the core statuses of devices can be expressed and easily published in these real-time human-readable/data messages, that (ii) the data structure can comprise both core data types and a looser, name-spaced set of data types, that (iii) a real-time rules engine can trigger a device to action when a set of arbitrary criteria occur, and that (iv) these criteria and responses can be created through a comparatively simple user interface.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is the development of a low-cost process to mitigating nitrate, a ubiquitous pollutant that is steadily eroding the quality and availability of safe potable water all around the world. This novel process combines and sequences electrochemistry, aqueous chemical reactions, solid oxide formation and surface adsorption processes into a simple continuous-flow unit to achieve high levels of nitrate removal; optimization will be guided by computational techniques that lend themselves to discovery of new materials that may also demonstrate breakthrough potential for other critical fields such as fuel treatment and large scale energy storage. The project offers an opportunity to apply interdisciplinary solutions to complex societal problems and will yield a self-contained unit, inexpensive to build and operate, scalable, modular and reliable.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop an inexpensive water treatment module for selective removal of nitrate from aqueous media. The module employs a novel sequence of electrochemically controlled processes to promote in situ formation and ripening of metal hydrous oxide crystals, with documented adsorptive effectiveness, readily separating them from continuously flowing water. The primary objectives of this project are refining and addressing the high risk aspects of this methodology, merging field experience with concepts from published papers, sequencing processes and regulating conditions in novel ways, enhancing adsorption properties while mitigating interferences by oxyanions.  The technology will advance understanding of metal hydrous oxides and the kinetics of their formation, which may well inform creation of other inexpensive processes for simultaneous removal of multiple problematic pollutants, potentially recovering them for commercial re-use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I projec is wide ranging due to the flexibility of the laser source design. The goal of the proposed work is an innovative approach to the development of a new class of compact, low cost, high-power laser sources at wavelengths that are currently difficult to achieve while providing addition functionality with no additional power consumption. This will make a highly efficient laser package. In addition to the application rich mid-IR, the laser design can easily be extended to other wavelengths in the far-IR, THz, visible, and UV portions of the spectrum. The approach can have a significant impact in many technical fields. The discoveries made within the scope of this program will have a transformative impact in mid- to far-IR lasers and has the ability to benefit disciplines including: laser surgery, dental surgery, dermatology, atmospheric monitoring, chemical sensing, and a broad range of defense applications including LADAR and laser range finding. In addition to the technological impact, the proposed research will cover multiple disciplines in science and engineering including high energy material properties, semiconductor physics, nonlinear optics and laser physics which will provide a unique research opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for versatile laser sources operating in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral region. Currently available lasers sources are limited in their capabilities. Wavelength selection and maximum output powers are limited, and efficiency, reliability and costs are also issues. High-power vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers (VECSEL) which employs multiple chip arrangements have the potential to reach wavelengths that are not easily attainable in a very compact package. In addition, the introduction of multiple laser cavities provides a means for generating outputs in the near-IR with no additional power consumption. Using a high power doubly-resonant two-color T-cavity VECSEL, efficient difference frequency conversion will be achieved. High power outputs in the mid-IR (8-12 µm) spectral region will be demonstrated through a novel design in which the VECSEL chips will contain multiple laser cavities that can provide broad spectral coverage in the near-IR from the same device. This will lead to enhanced efficiency and provide more capabilities such as laser targeting and range finding with no additional power consumption.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve imaging systems used in surveying and surveillance. Specifically, the project intends to overcome the long range resolution problems created by air turbulence which is the primary limitation on resolution at long distances. The project anticipates creating a light weight, ultra-high resolution camera system deployable on land, sea and air drones to speed search & rescue, identify crop diseases, improve oil and mineral exploration success, rapidly identify infrastructure problems and improve homeland security operations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the limitations placed on long range imaging by air turbulence using a novel non-classical approach. Using sun as the light source, this camera may achieve a spatial resolution of 200 micrometers for any object on Earth, which is insignificant for short distance imaging, however, taking a picture of a target at 10-kilometer, a classic camera must have a lens of 90-meter diameter to achieve a theoretical 200-micrometer resolution. Thus, the turbulence free camera will provide "panoramic" photographs with micron-level resolution at large distances. The research will convert a successful lab scale camera system performing non-classical imaging into a fully functional prototype for use in real world environments.

    schools, and restaurants, 4) reduce and/or eliminate the number of institutional
    lawsuits resulting from peanut allergy events, 5) reduce and/or eliminate the
    number of expensive food recalls due to peanut contaminations, 6) gain back the
    loss endured by the peanut market, and improve the U.S. competitive edge on the
    international peanut market, and 7) increase sales by 15% to 20% due to an increase
    market by restaurants, airlines and more. Food allergies cost the US $25 billion
    annually and peanut is a major contributor. The proposed allergen-reduced peanut
    may provide a significant solution to peanut allergy with the potential to reduce
    the overall cost of food allergy.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to
    produce a commercial prototype for an allergen-reduced peanut. In previous works,
    concomitant down regulation of the 3 most potent allergens Ara h1, Ara h2 and
    Ara h3 was demonstrated and resulted in 2 to 25 fold reduction in allergenic potency.
    The allergen-reduced trait was transmitted to four successive generations in the
    progeny in field trials. However, the populations of transgenic seeds were not
    homogeneous; they displayed variable levels of allergenic potency among pods from
    the same plant. To solve this problem, an alternative transformation method based
    on Repetitive Somatic Embryogenesis is proposed to produce new sets of transgenic
    peanut plants devoid of chimerism. During this Phase I project, molecular, biochemical
    and immunological analyses will be performed to confirm the new sets of transgenic
    peanut plant lines are chimera-free, and a commercial prototype for the allergen-reduced
    peanut will be identified."

    Transfer (STTR) project will be to transform the current models for bone marrow-
    and cord blood-derived cell therapies and make cell therapy, especially the patients'
    own cells, more widely available for use by healthcare providers and patients.
    Two major technical hurdles in the regenerative medicine field have prevented
    the translation of cell therapy from the bench to the bedside, despite the huge
    surge in clinical trials being conducted worldwide: 1) The lack of devices for
    the isolation of native clinically active bone marrow or cord blood derived cells
    without gradient selection and centrifugation that lead to cell loss and decreased
    cell viability; and 2) The logistical hurdles of cell isolation and processing
    in \"centralized\" cell production facilities. The prevalent approaches involve
    the collection of patient tissues such as bone marrow samples at hospitals, transport
    of samples to the central cell production facilities, isolation and expansion
    of cells using different protocols, and transporting the cell product back to
    the hospital sites for transplantation into patients. Every step of this cell
    therapy and transplantation process is expensive, involves multiple teams and
    poses a potential risk for introducing contamination, cellular loss and other
    complications. The technology proposed in this project is incorporated in a device
    that has the potential to overcome these two hurdles. The device allows the derivation
    of adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs) that are native or minimally manipulated,
    in a GMP-compliant process for isolation and delivery of cells for cell therapy
    applications in hospitals and outpatient clinics, thereby circumventing transportation
    requirement and central facility processing and making cell therapy more widely
    available. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to overcome the hurdles in the
    regenerative medicine field by developing a device that enables GMP-grade stem
    cell processing in a functionally closed system. This project will validate GMP-grade
    isolation of the fraction of the bone marrow, the adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs)
    for use in cell therapy applications, initially for spinal cord injuries. While
    the ultimate goal is to conduct IND enabling studies, this Phase I grant objectives
    covers: 1) GMP-compliant coating of the device surface with matrix molecules and
    validation for efficient collection of ABMCs, 2) Post processing validation of
    ABMC sample integrity. Since the device also has a provision component for freezing
    of the processed samples, objective 3) is to validate ABMC freezing and cell recovery.
    Safety assays will include sterility and end product monitoring. Non-retrospective
    flow cytometry assays will be utilized to analyze CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90,
    CD105, CD106, CD166, and CD271 expression, essential markers that distinguish
    ABMCs. Higher percentages of CD106 and CD271 are expected for ABMCs. The potential
    for CFU-F formation, along with adipogenic, osteogenic and neuronal potentials
    of ABMCs will be examined and compared with standard mesenchymal stem cells. The
    collection of bone marrow cells with superior regenerative potentials, as indicated
    with previous pilot studies, is anticipated."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase I project is the capability to enable small- and medium-sized commercial buildings to operate more efficiently and facilitate their participation in electricity markets. It will result in energy consumption reduction in buildings, thus providing savings in electricity bills and lowering carbon footprints, without compromising occupant comfort. The proposed platform also enables revenue generation by allowing buildings to participate in ancillary electricity markets and respond to pricing or demand response signals from electric utilities. By integrating intelligent energy management and automatic demand response features to the traditional building operation, this helps electric utility companies to avoid/defer extensive upgrades of their electrical infrastructures, such as generation, transmission or distribution facilities, with the growing demand for electricity. The proposed software platform demonstrates the benefits of building automation to building owners/operators, and provides them the ability to cross-reference their buildings with best practices in building operations. It also bridges the knowledge transfer process between a small business and an institution of higher education by facilitating both sides to meet, work and exchange experiences with each other.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is built on an agent-based platform for building automation systems where advanced algorithms enable the software platform to be proactive and help optimize building operations. It can also perform fault detection, diagnostics and predictive maintenance, integrate emerging Internet of Things (IoT) devices and enable buildings to interact with the grid in an intelligent manner. Under the proposed project, a reinforced machine-learning algorithm will be developed that uses historical building energy consumption data and ambient conditions - including occupant preferences - to optimize building operations based on usage patterns of major loads and power sources in each zone of the building. Another major research contribution lies in novel algorithms that enable buildings to transact with the grid. These allow buildings to respond to system stress conditions and electricity price signals by automatically adjusting the operation of major loads and internal generating sources. Overall, the proposed software platform allows a building to optimize its operation, perform peak demand management during grid stress conditions, and participate in ancillary service markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring a disruptive Light Emitting Diode (LED) assembly technology closer to commercialization and enable the creation of a transformative, low cost manufacturing platform needed to manufacture future efficient high resolution LED displays as well as other complex integrated electronic systems. This project's success will revolutionize large-area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to significant improvements in display quality, while achieving large reductions in display energy consumption, just as high efficiency LEDs have dramatically reduced energy consumption in lighting systems. Direct view all-LED displays offer superior viewing quality and high resolution at significant energy savings over current LCD and OLED technologies. There is a huge demand for information displays of increasing higher resolution, but LED display manufacturers face a very high cost in LED packaging.  This new LED assembly technology can drastically reduce the LED packaging cost by an order of magnitude for extremely high quality LED displays. This technology can also be extended to the assembly of any other types of small semiconductor die components on large area substrates for systems, such as solar systems, flexible electronics, and distributed networked electronic surfaces.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and help commercialize a radically new technology for high speed, high precision assembly of small LEDs for manufacturing energy efficient, high performance direct view  Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays. This patent-pending technology overcomes the limitations of incumbent pick-and-place technologies and wafer-scale stamping technologies currently in development. This assembly tool is considerably simpler and less expensive, while achieving much higher assembly rates for almost any LED size, pixel pitch and display dimensions. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the commercialization viability of this technology with well characterized baseline processes. A set of process metrics and scaling rules will be established for future product development. This project will result in a prototype assembly system and a LED display demo to demonstrate the value proposition of this technology for the LED display manufacturing industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a medical device that accelerates wound healing and prevents infection.  Wound contamination and infection are notoriously challenging to treat and are a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and other microbial colonization in wounds delay healing, cause further degradation, and can lead to severe complications including deep tissue and bone infections, as well as stroke and sepsis. The wound care field is large and diverse and includes acute and chronic wounds, pre- and post-surgical care and scar prevention, burns, as well as emergency wound care in war settings and homeland security. Due to the aging population and increasing rates of diabetes and obesity, the entire global wound care products market is expanding rapidly at an estimated 7% per year and currently totals over $21B. Moreover, new financial reimbursement policies to reduce the estimated $50B US economic burden of wounds are incentivizing hospitals to improve care, reduce infection, and accelerate patient recovery. The market is ripe for a medical technology that treats wound infections.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a high voltage power supply capable of driving a cold plasma medical device that treats wound infections. Cold plasma is ideal for treating wound infections because it is effective against all bacteria types and is unlikely to confer bacterial resistance. It is superior in its anti-microbial effect compared to topical antibiotics and antiseptics but safe for human skin. Our research objectives include scaling the output voltage, shortening pulse width, enabling thermal, overvoltage, and overcurrent protections, and incorporating voltage control feedback. Anticipated technical results include completion of these research objectives and testing of the power supply with the cold plasma device on bacterial cultures to confirm antibacterial effects.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish to achieve robust solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Currently available ENIG surface finishes are prone to so-called "black pads", which are sites of galvanic hyper corrosion that lead to failures associated with de-wetting of solder, brittle solder joints, component disconnection, and overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Existing substitute surface finishes are either very expensive or do not resolve the black pad defects fully, and they can compromise other key properties. The cost-effective novel ENIG to be developed will eliminate black pads, corrosion related issues, achieve robust solder joints and provide improved quality & reliability of electronic assembly products to end consumers. This will allow manufacturers to avoid major product field failures and the resulting consequences. This new technology would be a potential replacement for existing ENIG (with a market value in excess of $400 million) and other surface finishes (representing a market exceeding $1 billion).

    The intellectual merit of this project includes development of a cost-effective novel ENIG to eliminate black pads and achieve robust solder joints. The root cause of black pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity of the immersion gold process which originates at intergranular boundaries and crevices of the nickel-phosphorous surface.  Galvanic hyper-corrosion occurs between gold and nickel atoms, resulting in nickel depletion and an enrichment of phosphorous atoms in the localized area.  The proposed research would use an interfacial engineering approach at the gold and nickel-phosphorous interfaces to prevent black pads and eliminate brittle solder failures in the electronic assemblies. The main objective of the proposed Phase I research is to achieve marked improvement in corrosion resistance (eliminate black pads) and attain robust solder joints (eliminate brittle solder joint failures). This will involve identifying right interfacial chemistry and process parameters.  Corrosion resistance of this new process will be evaluated using electrochemical corrosion tests and acid tests.  In addition, solder joint strength and properties (brittle/ductile) will be investigated using ball shear tests and cold ball pull tests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to streamline and reduce the cost of manufacturing biopharmaceuticals by developing a heterologous protein expression system for large scale batch and continuous flow fermentation systems. Currently, many large molecule therapeutics, such as insulin, are made using bacterial host organisms. These cells are genetically engineered to produce large quantities of a desired product, known as a recombinant protein, in the cellular compartments of these single-celled organisms. However, due to the small size of bacteria and its unfavorable physiology, these products often end up interfering with production and require additional costs and effort to then extract, purify and activate the product. The T3S system is the most efficient known protein secretion system in bacteria, and could enable rapid export of recombinant proteins, allowing for these products to be produced in a favorable environment and negate the need for extraction, exhaustive purification, and costly reactivation of the product.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the a protein expression system based on the bacterial Type-III Secretion (T3S) system for use in scalable fermenters to maximize the yield output. The goal is to test different media types as well as different growth and expression conditions, and then quantify the amount of secreted protein through various techniques. Additionally, this Phase I project will develop for the first time a continuous flow manufacturing process with a bacterial production system for greater efficiency, and further reduce the cost and effort associated with recombinant protein production. Due to the T3S systems' rapid and direct secretion of products directly into the supernatant a new filtration system to continually harvest the spent media for product will be employed. In addition, the purity of the secreted products directly from the spent media will be characterized to determine what additional purification steps are required. Finally, the T3S system unfolds proteins as they are secreted into the oxidative media lead by their N-terminus, in the same manner that they are translated by the ribosome. This maximizes the possibility for proteins to form into their native and active confirmation, which will be verified using LC-MS techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing better method for connected systems and devices to interact with each other. Current solutions require many months of development and cost of development and maintenance can be overwhelming.  The proposed technology offers a way for interaction between systems and devices to be configured rather than programmed. The technology also provides a way for services to be configured by the user, rather than relying on developers to create nodes or connectors.  This is made possible through abstracting out the interaction layer of software stack and creating a generic algorithm for interaction to be configured. Much like when routers first came out, technology of abstracting out a portion of software stack opens up opportunity for market to perform tasks that once were programmer dependent.  Abstraction of router code enabled growth of Internet. We believe abstraction of Interaction code will enable IoT to be widely deployed. Societal impact is achieved through large number of interactive solution being created, and exponentially growing number of sensors and devices to be utilized in full.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve the problem of creating interaction between services being programmer dependent. In order for services to interact, they need to be able to connect, communicate, and then interact. Industry has done a great job in abstracting out various components of application layers to provide connectivity and communication between two services. However, interaction logic has always been software developed. It is the single largest bottleneck in Internet of Things (IoT) solution creation, deployment, and operation. All available tools for integration are development tools. New method of creating solutions is being proposed where a solution is designed and deployed around configured interaction logic. This is different to many development tools that allow communication between services through custom service bus, messaging protocols, and APIs. Interaction logic sits on top of communication and connectivity layers. Technology involves methods and apparatus to enable interaction between all connected things, and for enabling dynamic mapping of interactions through service elements. The technology will provide easy, rapid, and cost effective proliferation of IoT solutions. Since IoT solutions are mostly interaction between devices and applications, abstracted out interaction logic allows entire solutions to be created through configuration of interaction logic.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can dramatically transform the population of people to whom automation, and its well-documented benefits, is available.  The lack of tools targeted at truly nontechnical users that still have the aspiration to be practically useful (rather than educational in nature) is a barrier to many.  The approach taken in this proposal could reduce or remove this barrier and bring simple, moving machines into many more environments.  For hobbyists, this means increased ability to self-design the logical behavior of the machines and simple devices already being created in this group.  For small to medium sized businesses, this may mean increased productivity, quality, and revenue, particularly for small-batch processes.  Further into the future, this technology can be applied to home automation where it is critical for society that all users have control over the behavior of their connected devices, particularly in such a personal space where social and cultural considerations require individual customization to design how the "smart" things around the home move.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two main objectives.  First, the computational scalability of an initial, proof-of concept prototype will be tested.  Technical hurdles for this objective include the development of a scalable code architecture and support for a larger number of so-called sensing and action primitives, which will be explained in the proposal.  Second, the ability of an untrained user to move from a contextualized use-case to specific logic design will be determined. Technical hurdles for this objective are in the domain of human factors, where a relatively complex process must be distilled to essential steps that an untrained user can relate to a familiar process in a particular environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to standardize the process of securing and protecting umbilical cord catheters. These catheters are inserted into newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are used to provide life-saving nutrients and medication directly into their bloodstream. Unfortunately, the infection rate associated with these catheters is among the highest in the healthcare system. There is an important need for a simple medical device that reduces the risk of infection. A reduction in infection rate would save hospitals hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they must currently absorb the cost of treating these infections. Most importantly, reducing umbilical catheter infection rates would save neonatal lives in any hospital setting.

    The proposed project will develop a standardized device that reliably secures umbilical cord catheters and protects the catheter insertion site from various sources of infection. The current standard of care for securing these catheters in NICUs across the United States is a roll of non-sterile tape that offers no protective barrier to the catheter insertion site. This is in stark contrast to medical devices that are used with adult catheters and help prevent bloodstream infections. The research objectives include evaluating different materials, testing the catheter securement mechanism, testing bacterial colonization rates, and evaluating the device?s biosafety for use on neonatal skin. This will be accomplished using custom-built testing rigs and protocols. We anticipate the successful development of a device with material specifications that allow for clinical testing in the NICU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit nearly 6 million children per year who are suspected of having abnormal Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) which can lead to a more serious condition with numerous complications referred to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Current detection paradigms include costly and invasive procedures that often require overnight hospitalization, prescribing pharmacological Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) without objective evidence and or exposure to radiological imaging.  The outcomes of this project will lead to a low cost, non-invasive method for detecting GER, without requiring hospitalization.  This will facilitate earlier detection of GER and reduce overall healthcare costs and burdens associated with GERD and its accompanying complications.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using single point ultrasonic transducers to non-invasively detect and characterize reflux.  Current reflux detection relies on impedance and pH probes which are placed in the patient?s esophagus through a nasogastric probe.  This often requires anesthesia and overnight hospital observation which is costly, invasive, and prone to artifacts that change the reflux episodes normally experienced by the patient.  Ultrasonic imaging can observe reflux occurring in the esophagus but requires hundreds of ultrasonic transducers in a single probe and a trained clinician to manually observe and identify the reflux events.  These two factors make ultrasonic imaging costly to use and prevents it from being used for extended periods of time, which is necessary to determine if abnormal amounts of reflux are occurring.  The proposed project will use ultrasonic imaging as a control method to demonstrate the ability of single point ultrasonic transducers to generate an acoustic signature capable of detecting whether the esophagus is expanded or collapsed to identify episodes of reflux.  Detection and characterization of reflux through single point transducers would ultimately enable the development of a portable, safe, and accurate home monitoring device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering and enhance the workflow efficiency in physically-based rendering. This can impact a broad range of industries, including video games, product visualization, animation, visual effects, scientific rendering and virtual/augmented reality. The superior performance and greatly reduced cost will allow the same system to be used in the manufacturing industry, which requires high-resolution depth measurement. This technology will result in the broader adoption of non-contact 3D metrology and 3D machine vision for manufacturing quality control and defect inspection.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot decouple the direct reflection and sub-surface scattering. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance and greatly reduced cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help establish a commercially viable method for mass production of high-efficiency heat exchangers for the rapid advancement of thermoelectric solar cells and waste heat management. The advancement to be made in this project will help harvest an enormous amount of solar energy and heat energy from the environment. Thermal energy from natural (solar, geothermal etc.) as well as from man-made thermal sources is a continuously available, and currently underutilized resource with the potential to become an important pillar of renewable energy. The solar thermoelectric devices require minimal maintenance and are suitable for deployment in remote regions. The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the performance of solar thermoelectric generators. Besides harnessing solar energy, thermoelectric devices can also be used for waste heat recovery from automobile exhaust and industries using high-temperature furnaces to enhance fuel efficiency and generate electricity for automotive operations. Our estimated outcome can enhance the fuel efficiency of automobile engines by 15-20 %with around $67 billion annual reductions in gasoline expenses and around 570 billion pound reduction in annual carbon emission.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a disruptive technology to improve the efficiency of thermoelectric devices. Currently, the efficiency of thermoelectric devices is much lower than their theoretical values due to the lack of ideal heat exchanger materials for both hot and cold ends. The research goal is to enhance current module efficiency by more than 90%. The project includes testing and validation of the heat exchanger into thermoelectric generation modules for solar electricity generation and waste heat management from thermal sources at different temperatures, as well as developing methods for mass production of heat exchanger materials. The size of the treated surfaces can be well controlled, making it possible to fabricate microscale solar thermal devices for infrared sensors and night vision cameras.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable doctors to maximize the diagnostic information extracted from costly Pediatric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Annually, approximately 3.5 million brain MRI scans are performed with average prices with interpretation from $500 - $2,000. Even though the scans are expensive to acquire and interpret, doctors generally only use visual inspection of the images to diagnose abnormalities. The proposed software will be relatively cheap compared to the overall cost of an MRI and is expected to let doctors make accurate measurements of key structures in the brain. This is important because developmental and other diseases can cause small volume and surface area changes that cannot be easily seen by the human eye. By detecting these changes early, doctors should be able to treat the disease at early stages, potentially leading to better quality of life and financial savings. The proposed tool is also expected to enable doctors to better track treatment outcomes, by measuring the effect a drug or treatment has on particular structures in the brain. Ultimately, it is expected that the proposed technology will improve quality of care as well as reduce healthcare costs.

    The proposed project leverages current advances in computational technology such as machine learning and computer vision to automatically measure volume, surface area and shapes in critical parts of the brain in children. These measurements are then compared to a large database of children over the ages of 0-12 years to determine if they have deviated from normal. Although MRIs have been increasing adopted as the diagnostic tool of choice for childhood brain disorders due to the lack of radiation, there has yet to be a tool that allows doctors to accurately measure changes in a child's brain from MRI scans. Because, in children, the brain is rapidly changing as she/he grows, it is difficult to determine visually whether the changes are due to normal development or disease. By measuring the brain accurately and comparing it to a large database already collected by the proposing team, it is expected that a pediatric doctor will be able to determine whether a child's brain has deviated from normal. It could also allow physicians to better select treatments and monitor the patient response to a specific therapy.

    Research (SBIR) project is to engineer brewer's yeast for a more consistent, cost-effective,
    and sustainable brewing process. The flowers of hop plants provide both bitterness
    and \"hoppy\" flavor to beer. Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive
    crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it expensive and difficult
    to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.  The goal is to engineer brewer's
    yeast to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor
    to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil.
    Over the last two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for
    beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries
    to source (total domestic hop sales have tripled over the last 10 years due to
    heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources:
    ~100 trillion liters of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops.
    Reducing the reliance of the brewing industry on hops would significantly increase
    the sustainability of the brewing process by decreasing water usage, also leading
    to the commercial benefits of decreased brewing costs and greater consistency
    of beer flavor.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer the biosynthesis
    of hop-derived monoterpenes in brewer's yeast to meet the following industrial
    performance requirements: 1) Normal propagation and fermentation characteristics,
    2) precise and robust production of monoterpenes at scale, and 3) the absence
    of off-flavors. The proposed research sets out to test whether the expression
    of 5 key biosynthesis pathway enzymes can be expressed in a way that each of these
    performance requirements is met in a single strain.  Recently developed synthetic
    biology tools will be used to create hundreds of DNA constructs, each containing
    a different combination of promoters driving expression of the 4 corresponding
    genes (designs).  Incorporating genetically stable DNA constructs into brewer's
    yeast is complicated by their polyploid genome. To overcome this difficulty, preliminary
    work was conducted to develop a Cas9-mediated integration strategy, which leverages
    a colorometric assay to assist with the challenge of identifying stable pathway
    transformants.  Strains will be constructed and evaluated in two subsequent rounds.
    \ In the first round, a diverse set of designs will be explored, and in a second
    round, strains will be constructed based on the designs that most closely meet
    with performance requirements and avoid production of potential off-flavors."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a new disruptive approach to enable the digital transformation of US industrial infrastructure through extreme low latency, highly reliable and secure wireless networks. The proposal aligns closely with U.S. government programs such as Manufacturing USA and the National Robotics Initiative. The World Economic Forum reported recently that manufacturing has been immensely important to the prosperity of nations. This has never been more true than right now as countries compete to make huge investments in the digital transformation process of their manufacturing firms. The innovation provides significant advancement that is expected to boost U.S. worker productivity, advance wireless innovation and increase cost savings and business agility. The Industrial Internet of Things drives new investment in automated factories, industrial digital networks and integration with real-time edge computing. Data expansion at the edge of today's networks are new challenges for industrial firms that seek to deploy flexible and economically viable digital infrastructure. The company provides an innovative solution that enables wireless edge computing. Instead of expensive and inflexible wired networks, this new technology unlocks the full potential of wireless sensor networks for automation and control systems. 

    The proposed project will demonstrate the company's concept of ultra-secure, highly reliable, time-sensitive/synchronized wireless protocol for Industrial IoT markets. The novel system design is a general purpose, extremely low latency, wireless communications link that supports real-time connection to industrial devices. The company's technology operates chaos-based spread spectrum communications links, functional chaos-based IIoT sub-nets with anticipated scalability of a plurality of sub-nets operating within unlicensed bands. Enabling an extreme precision time synchronization is critical to industrial systems and network applications in time-sensitive edge computing networks. To date, standard access technologies such as Ethernet are not deterministic and clock synchronization protocols are fundamentally limited by the characteristics of packet switching or efficient access to reliable clocks. In particular, legacy network's jitter, packet buffering and scheduling in switches and network stack overheads add non-deterministic variances to the round trip time, which must be accurately measured to synchronize clocks. This proposal is for a wireless-based synchronization technology that uses more granular timing mechanisms to achieve nanosecond precision. The company introduces a clock synchronization protocol that uses wireless chaotic waveforms that connects to network devices for decentralized clock synchronization. This eliminates the need for wires and non-deterministic elements in clock synchronization protocols.

    rely on the rate of speed difference at which product and impurities travel in
    a solid matrix when eluted with solvents for separation. Drawbacks include expensive
    instrumentation, intensive labor, use of large volumes of harmful solvents and
    inability to purify long sequences. This method is expensive to scale up and unsuitable
    for parallel purification. This project aims to commercialize the catching full-length
    sequence by polymerization oligodeoxynucleotide purification technology to solve
    these problems. The method works by selectively tagging a polymerizable group
    to the oligodeoxynucleotide product, polymerizing it into an insoluble polymer,
    washing away all impurities and then cleaving the product from the polymer. Because
    the principle on which the product is separated from impurities is drastically
    different from that of chromatography methods, the proposed technique has many
    advantages, which include no need for expensive instrumentation, simple-to-use,
    low waste to product ratio, and suitability for purification of long sequences.
    Additionally, the new technique is readily scalable for large-scale purification,
    and can be easily adopted for parallel purification."

    This SBIR Phase I project uses artificial intelligence techniques to identify the ways that undergraduate students in scientific courses explicate problems, describe procedures, make claims, provide evidence, offer qualifications, and draw conclusions. With emphasis on forms of scientific reasoning, this new use of artificial intelligence, to identify language patterns associated with scientific reasoning, will allow students to improve their written laboratory reports before they are submitted, therefore freeing instructors to devote precious instructional time to preparing students for roles as practicing scientists. As the U.S. continues to experience rapid diversity growth, this focus on helping students through innovative uses of technology holds the potential to expand science education by cultivating student ability through autonomous writing and revision. Because artificial intelligence techniques are intended to expand capabilities, the techniques being used, available 24/4 on the web, will have the direct impact of growing our technical and scientific workforce, thus expanding the many dynamic pathways to STEM occupations. As the NSF observed in 2015 in its report Revisiting the STEM Workforce, these jobs are extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness and are essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness. An investment in such a technology is thus an investment in national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and workforce diversity.

    NSF SBIR support will be used to design and launch artificial intelligence techniques based on Deep Artificial Neural Network (DANN) as driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the latest advances in AI algorithms. Because NLP and LSA techniques are presently used solely to identify grammatical and organizational patterns, the application of DANN is high risk in making a leap from identifying patterns of language use to capturing patterns of scientific reasoning. Trained on a proprietary corpus of 100,000 lab reports scored and annotated by instructors and students using a single rubric, the AI application will identify logic structures of scientific reasoning in student laboratory reports. Once methodically identified, categorized according to ability level, and validated by STEM instructors, digital instruction will be used to help students improve their scientific reasoning processes. With the singular goal of structuring student success through asynchronous machine learning, this innovation holds the promise to figure meaningfully in discussions of national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and diversity as related to STEM education.

    This STTR Phase I project will enable the rapid prototyping and manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) components with 3D printing, and thereby reduce component cost, weight, and turnaround time. The global RF components market is expected to reach $17.54 billion by 2022, but fabrication techniques for commercial RF components have seen little innovation. Conventional RF manufacturing techniques, such machining and photolithography, are accurate and reliable, but they are also expensive, time-consuming and produce unnecessary waste. 3D printing enables fast and accurate manufacturing of custom components, as well as the creation of extremely complex geometries at low-cost for improved component performance. 3D printing can also enable users to design components to fit the design space available, removing the necessity of designing technology around commercially available parts, a critical feature in space and weight-sensitive aerospace applications. However, the materials available to 3D printing are mostly limited to non-conducting polymers. By creating a highly conductive 3D printing material, and testing the properties of RF components made with this filament, this project will make it possible to rapidly prototype and produce custom RF components, thereby accelerating research and improving the competitiveness of RF component manufacturing in the U.S.

    This STTR proposal will create a highly conductive (>2×10^5 S m-1) polymer filament that can be used with low-cost fused deposition modeling 3D printers to create a variety of high-value RF components. The filament will be engineered to print reliably, and retain its conductivity and mechanical integrity to temperatures of ~150 °C. To achieve these goals, the proposed work will determine the relationship between conductivity, the loading of conductive filler, the shape of the conductive filler, the filament mechanical properties, and the viscosity of the filament at printing temperatures. New methods will be developed to prevent oxidation of the conductive filler at elevated temperatures. A novel conductive filler will be developed to achieve these performance specifications at low cost. Concurrent with these material development efforts, novel RF components will be designed, simulated, and printed in order to build a comprehensive database with detailed designs and printing parameters for producing the RF components with a low failure rate. By the end of this project, users will be able to design, predict, and reliably print RF components with conductive filament on low-cost 3D printers.

    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural

    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these

    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.

    This SBIR Phase I project will research the feasibility of applying virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in manufacturing and material testing training programs to increase academic achievement, accelerate progress toward degree and foster more effective use of expensive lab-equipment.  According to 2014 statistics, in the United States, less than 40% of students entering college in STEM fields finish with a STEM degree. And even for those who finish, a majority (over 60% ) take several years longer than the nominal time of 4 years. Providing students with VR and AR enabled personalized manufacturing labs is a promising way to increase students' engagement and better prepare them for future careers as well as broaden students' outlook on innovation. As described in the recent US council report on competitiveness, advanced manufacturing has the largest multiplier effect on jobs. In order for the US to gain competitiveness in this sector, there is a pressing need for a trained workforce that is able to develop new materials testing protocols and manufacturing processes. This SBIR project aims to develop technologies that enable the education sector to leverage VR and AR to accelerate training. Proposed software will be evaluated through pilot testing. Technology and insights resulting from this project may find applications in other domains such as life sciences.


    Key technical innovations in this proposed research include the development of a novel high-fidelity modular virtual object model, customized task models based on evidence centered design, and methods to flexibly combine object models with task models to rapidly develop activities suitable for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. These innovations may significantly reduce the content creation cost and potentially dissolve the boundary between classroom education and hands-on training, providing an effective and seamless educational experience. In the long term, these innovations may also be applied broadly to training in other domains. The overarching goal of this SBIR project is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system for content creation and learning analytics and apply them to create innovative content for use in manufacturing courses. The proposed system and content will be evaluated via pilot testing with engineering students to collect rich datasets comprising videos, sensor time series data and simulation-event logs. Data analysis will seek evidence for changes in both students outcomes (changes in content knowledge, engagement, attitude towards engineering, self-efficacy towards learning engineering, usability of the product) and instructor outcomes (attitudes about the usefulness of the product).

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of the Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a bioreactor that may be used for production and expansion of cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery.  While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of an instrument to address the
    scaling and regulatory challenges of quality control that increase cost and impede
    large scale deployment of cellular therapies to a wide patient base. Cellular
    therapies taking advantage of engineered human cells have shown incredible potential
    as \"living drugs\" that achieve personalized therapies for cancer patients. Recent
    improvements in these therapies have shown their efficacy in targeting and killing
    specific types of leukemias. In light of these successes, more and more research
    and clinical trials are being proposed to improve current efficacy in treating
    blood cancers and adapting these therapies to other cancers types. While showing
    promise in the fight against cancer, there is growing concern over the manufacturability
    of clinical doses, especially when scaling up to meet global demands. Additionally,
    the speed at which these therapies are being developed is causing regulatory agencies
    to lag behind in terms of quality control and release criteria. Both of these
    issues will need to be addressed as cellular therapies continue to improve and
    increase in demand. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated
    quality control instrument for the manufacture of cellular therapies, which centers
    around a disruptive new technology called ratcheting cytometry. Currently, quality
    control of therapeutic cell batches remains difficult to standardize and scale
    given the plethora of standalone tools needed to adequately characterize each
    batch. This modular approach has high capital cost, high recurring maintenance
    costs, and requires skilled technicians. Ideally, the capabilities of these standalone
    tools can be combined into one automated system to provide standardized metrics
    for cellular therapy quality without user variability. Leveraging well-established
    immunomagnetic cell labeling techniques, ratcheting cytometry is able combine
    the capabilities of quality control tools by individually measuring magnetic content
    and gating based on surface expression. Leveraging these advantages, the goal
    is to demonstrate feasibility for an integrated instrument to quantify cell number,
    viability, surface expression, and cytokine secretion of therapeutic cell batches
    in a single step assay."

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor
    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,
    and to implement on-chip blood plasma separation for PT/INR measurements."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a new class of biorational chemicals (based on chemical communicants from plant symbiotic fungi) that provide season-long improvements in plant productivity including enhanced root growth, resistance to a variety of stresses including drought, and increases in plant yield. This system will be developed for delivery as a seed treatment or as an augmented fertilizer. The novel products will be sold to famers through already-developed delivery systems primarily through agricultural distributors and seed companies. They are expected to increase plant root development, crop yields and tolerance/resistance to drought and other adverse conditions. The products can be used equally well by large and sophisticated farmers and seed companies, including those using advanced plant genetic traits, but is also adaptable to smaller growers since the input costs to users will be less than competitive technologies for especially coping with adverse environmental stresses. These tools and advances will assist is overcoming the adverse effects of climate change and provide technologies to maximize scarce water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to formulate the active chemicals to provide user-friendly products for delivery in suitable agricultural systems including seed treatments and augmented fertilizers, and to evaluate prototype products on their advantages in the greenhouse, pilot scale and field trial systems. The field trials will be conducted under conditions of drought stress and will permit measurement of water use efficiency of conventional and advanced drought tolerant corn hybrids in the presence and absence of the new products, and will provide a means to determine the mechanism by which the active chemicals provide improvements in plant performance. This third goal is essential since the chemicals as applied are present only during seed germination, but enhance plant performance throughout the season. The formulations are based on novel systems that will sequester volatile active chemicals but release them only when seeds are germinating. The plant performance characteristics that will be measured include enhanced root development throughout the season, enhanced yield parameters under water limiting conditions, and measure water use efficiency.

    Research (SBIR) project will be to digitize the human sense of smell and develop
    a platform to create \"humanized mice\" that that express any human odorant sensor
    in the nose of a mouse.  Tools have been developed to determine the unique odor
    codes for each individual odor mixture that exists today ranging from the fragrances
    in a perfumer's palette to the Chardonnay in your wine cellar. Such an olfactory
    code will allow flavor and fragrance companies to predict the \"smell\" of certain
    odor mixtures, and to engineer new compounds in a rational and more streamlined
    manner. This technology will have a significant commercial impact on existing
    consumer products, including food, personal hygiene, household products, and perfumes,
    by offering a solution to more efficiently design pleasing scents and flavors
    or to formulate compounds that block repulsive odors. In addition, the proposed
    chemical detector platform under development to generate this olfactory code has
    additional applications as a biosensor. It may be used to generate disease-specific
    chemosignatures identified in bodily fluids like urine, sweat or blood, which
    may have application in clinical diagnostics and biomarker discovery. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to use human odor sensors produced in their native
    environment, an olfactory sensory neuron, and develop an ex vivo biochemical assay
    to screen for odor sensor activation in a quantitative way. Since human odor sensors
    (odorant receptors) have proven to be exceptionally difficult to express in vitro,
    high-throughput screening of odorants using conventional pharmaceutical methods
    have not been possible to date. As such, only 10% of all human odorant sensors
    have been linked to their single odor. The preliminary data show that the in vivo
    expression of human odor sensors in mouse olfactory sensory neurons are functional.
    The objective of this project is to show that in vivo expressed odor sensors,
    when removed from their biological model system, maintain their functionality
    (i.e., ex vivo). A secondary objective is to demonstrate that several types of
    odor receptors, each with an accepted odor profile, will respond as predicted
    when analyzed ex vivo using a biochemical assay measuring direct activation of
    odorant receptors. Successful assay development will allow the generation of a
    viable platform that may be expanded with additional odor receptors to further
    decode human olfaction."

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop a detection technology that enables scientists
    and researchers to better understand biological particles circulating in biofluids.
    This improved understanding would lead to new disease diagnostics that could improve
    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The technology being developed allows
    high-throughput detection and characterization of exosomes, which are nanovesicles
    produced by cells and released in all biological fluids (e.g., blood, saliva,
    and urine). Exosomes are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including
    cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without
    the need of invasive tissue biopsies.  Early detection of disease from a simple
    blood or urine test allows discovery of disease at an earlier point making treatments
    more effective and reduces the need for costly and invasive procedures that could
    cause further complications. Furthermore, the same technology being developed
    also may be used to aid in the manufacturing of next-generation therapeutics that
    use exosomes to combat cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
    \n \nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a customer-configurable cartridge
    that will allow customization of biological probes to identify and measure specific
    populations of exosomes based on their surface markers. Exosomes, which are nanoparticles
    (50-200 nm) shed by cells into biological fluids, are being investigated for early
    detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative

    compared to other biomarkers, but their small size makes them very difficult to
    characterize with current techniques. This proposal is to create a high-throughput
    platform to address exosome characterization requirements through two development
    aims: 1) Develop, validate, and demonstrate a disposable microfluidic device that
    will allow customers to configure the assay for characterization of specific populations
    of exosomes, and 2) enable robust detection and identification of the smallest
    populations of low-index exosome nanoparticles, down to 50 nm, allowing complete
    exosome sizing in a high-throughput platform. The completion of these objectives

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a low cost educational platform which provides students a gateway to understanding and writing software code in modern real-world programming languages. The research addresses a pressing need in the K-12 setting to engage both teachers and students in Coding as a Literacy. Current approaches to teaching computer science and programming principles in K-12 often fail to bridge the gap between block-based graphical representations and text-based programming languages. Strong growth in Maker Spaces within school classrooms and libraries has led to a proliferation of Maker-oriented products in the K-12 setting, but teachers and students alike struggle to understand the software coding required to make meaningful use of them. The project embraces the Maker spirit with an expandable robotics platform that provides fertile ground for lesson development, paired with software that enables step-by-step execution of the student's code over a wireless connection. The commercialization of this technology will augment the effectiveness of STEM initiatives underway in the nation?s schools, keep students engaged in more advanced computer programming as they transition into middle and high school levels, boost the enrollment in technical disciplines at the University level, and ultimately increase the technology-related global competitiveness of the national workforce.

    The goal of this project is to overcome current limitations in microcontroller-based software development, with specific focus on the enablement of interactive debugging capabilities without the use of "target monitor" hardware external to the microcontroller itself. The project includes both software and hardware development efforts, as the research is directed at enabling a highly integrated system through the use of state-of-the-art silicon technology designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The advent of these System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits brings the potential for a radically lower cost, IP-connected educational technology platform. The hardware aspect of the project will include development of a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly leveraging a wireless SoC to provide a Wi-Fi connected robotic computing platform with an expandable circuit interface and a complement of built-in peripherals designed for educational applications. The software will provide a web-based user interface seamlessly integrated with the hardware platform to enable a level of interactive coding not previously seen on a wireless SoC. The commercialized product resulting from this project will leverage this interactive debugging user experience to teach real-world programming language development skills.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project is developing a novel drug delivery technology
    for pharmaceutical companies with drug products or investigational compounds that
    exhibit poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability. NanoContTM technology
    will provide a rapid and cost-effective approach for creating novel nanoformulated
    drug products for FDA-approved and investigational compounds. From a commercialization
    perspective, the technology will: (1) create improved nanoformulations of FDA-approved
    compounds to extend patent life and market exclusivity of established drugs, thus
    providing substantial value to pharmaceutical companies; (2) nanoformulate investigational
    compounds to increase their dissolution rate and bioavailability and facilitate
    the development of promising drug candidates that would otherwise be abandoned;
    (3) be developed on a continuous manufacturing platform, which will reduce overall
    development costs, decrease lead time, decrease manufacturing footprint, and permit
    manufacturing activities (currently outsourced abroad) to be relocated back to
    the U.S. Therefore, the NanoContTM is expected to have high commercial impact
    for pharmaceutical companies, facilitate development of novel drug candidates
    to benefit patients, and provide economic value by increasing manufacturing efficiencies
    and manufacturing jobs in the U.S. \n\nMAA Laboratories (MAA) is developing a
    novel drug delivery technology for pharmaceutical companies with drug products
    or investigational compounds that exhibit poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability.
    The NanoContTM drug delivery technology is a manufacturing platform that uses
    patent protected product specific formulation and process conditions to create
    nanocrystals and a patented polymer-coating process to coat and stabilize the
    nanocrystals. Polymer-coating of the drug nanoparticles acts as an energy barrier
    to prevent agglomeration, thus maintaining the enhanced dissolution characteristics
    and long-term product stability, as well as preventing downstream problems, such
    as inconsistent bioavailability and/or dosing. The NanoContTM platform is expected
    to be a disruptive technology because it offers strictly controlled particle size/size
    distribution, particle stabilization, low-cost scalability, and implementation
    on a continuous manufacturing platform. There are no competitive products that
    offer this unique combination of benefits. In summary, MAA?s NanoContTM drug delivery
    technology provides a novel method for nanoformulating pharmaceutical crystals
    in a polymer coated structure made of pharmaceutically acceptable polymers. The
    proposed technology on a continuous manufacturing platform is expected to provide
    a rapid, readily scalable, and broadly applicable process for developing and delivering
    poorly soluble compounds as novel patentable drug products with favorable dissolution,
    safety, and PK characteristics."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a simple to use "smoke alarm" for water appliances coupled with a level of insight into water consumption and failures that has never existed before. What was once a reliance on water meter data for the sum of all appliances is now a detailed understanding for each individual water fixture. This unprecedented access to water usage data at an individual appliance level will provide the opportunity for increased data analytics research, predictive analytics for failure modes and maintenance scheduling, and better understanding of human consumption habits to identify and solve problems that allow organizations to meet aggressive sustainability goals.  Only recently has there been an ability for hospitals to aggregate their medical information to aid research efforts to treat and cure chronic diseases and illnesses.  Mobius is looking to do the same for any building owner for water, as the growing concern to continued, reasonable costing fresh water becomes even greater.

    The proposed project will provide the opportunity for the development of an IoT Smart Water Management System (SWMS). It will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to both identify leaks so they can be corrected before wasting precious water and energy, and provide predictive analytics for actionable insights. This will significantly improve water appliance maintenance and prevent costly water damage to properties. Further, at a macro level, it provides municipality level insight for maintenance and crisis management. The vision is to easily install these SWMS devices into any existing water fixture. It will take less than 60 seconds to install and connect to the Internet. The design goal is to be cost-effective from the start. The SWMS provides an affordable and easy way to adopt data driven decision making into current operations. The critical objectives set forth in this proposal are centered on achieving a simple "smoke alarm" like warning of a fault coupled with a robust analytics platform.  Finally, these will be designed as highly durable IoT devices that require little or no maintenance.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to bring data-driven decision making to
    new areas of human interaction with technology. The Internet of Things (IoT) embodies
    the hardware, software, and systems that enable monitoring and managing objects
    in the physical world electronically. IoT devices will enable performance optimization
    of systems and processes, time savings for people and businesses, and quality
    of life improvements. The total economic impact of the IoT is estimated to exceed
    $11 trillion by 2025. However, reaching these lofty estimates requires advances
    in hardware technology, particularly for energy-constrained IoT devices that must
    gather data, make decisions based on the data gathered, and communicate to a larger
    system under a limited power budget. The company will develop low power embedded
    computer vision systems and machine learning algorithms for use in for virtual/augmented
    reality, drones, surveillance cameras and other applications.  \n\nThe proposed
    project advances the commercialization of new ?timing-resilient? chip technology,
    which promises unparalleled power efficiency by bringing dynamic voltage scaling
    to IoT devices with minimal impact on traditional design flows. Changing the operating
    voltage of a device can lead to significant energy efficiency improvements, yet
    many circuit designers do not take advantage of this technique due to increased
    design time and complexity. This proposal focuses on the development of a comprehensive
    computer-aided design (CAD) flow that transforms existing synchronous designs
    into more efficient asynchronous timing-resilient designs that support a wide
    range of voltages. The proposed project addresses three aspects of the automated
    flow: design for manufacturability and test; analysis of logic cell libraries
    at lower voltages; and interfacing the new timing-resilient circuits with synchronous
    circuits. The flow combines simulation, analysis, synthesis, place-and-route,
    and test with similar efficiency as standard commercial flows. This research aims
    to limit the additional testing overhead of the converted design and the performance
    impact of interfacing with traditional circuits to within 10% of synchronous counterparts.
    The development of this new flow will enable chip designs that are fundamentally
    more energy efficient and help bring the full power of machine learning to smaller
    form factors."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make the solar industry even more sustainable by reducting long term potential environmental impact. With the rapid deployment of solar modules, recycling of end-of-life modules will become a necessity in 15 years. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that end-of-life modules will appear in large quantities by the early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most end-of-life modules end up in landfills. More importantly, this project will develop a technology to enable a profitable recycling business without any government support, financial and/or legislative. IRENA predicts a new industry worth $15 billion by 2050 from recycling 78 million tonnes of modules. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The focus of the project is to recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, tin, aluminum, and glass. It will be demonstrated that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon and the recovered metals are over 99% pure. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The chemicals for recycling will be carefully chosen so their wastes neutralize each other for a minimal environmental impact.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is many-fold. The novel photosensor technology developed within this project will enable a new generation of ultrasensitive experiments in the broad field of astroparticle physics?designed and constructed on previously impossible scales This technology is advantageous as detectors of ultrahigh energy cosmic radiation, neutrinos, dark matter and more. In addition, our technology addresses societal needs, including advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. In medical application, the same core technology can enable the production of cost-effective ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners (patent pending) for preventive, virtually harmless (low-dose) cancer screening of the symptom-free population (a currently non-existent service). For nuclear security application, this technology can enable widespread and cost-effective detection of illicit fissionable and radioactive materials (also a currently non-existent possibility). In general, this project can lead to the creation of a highly profitable and multi-faceted hi-tech industry.

    The proposed project will meet the needs of our lead customer/partner, an international collaboration aiming at the detection of cosmic neutrino radiation at the South Pole site with unprecedentedly high sensitivity. Such sensitivity will be achieved in a volume of 10km^3 of ice, instrumented with 2500 m deep chains of detectors, and only a detector concept and cost-effective hi-tech production method like ours can reach that goal. However, harsh conditions at the experimental site require specific modifications to the core design of our invention. Pairs of modified photosensors will need to be packed into each detector unit, which will be electrically grounded on its surface, so the standard high-voltage connection must be swapped with the ground-potential. Consequently, the photodiode will be moved from the middle to the periphery, and specially designed light pipes will bring the light to them. At the same time, we will design a high-voltage power supply that will be integrated within the narrow spacing between the two photosensors. Additionally, this assembly must operate at -70 oC. Therefore, we will produce modified photosensors, design and produce all the additional components and interfaces, test the detectors under near-realistic conditions, and share them with our customer/partner for further evaluation and feedback.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying smart computer vision applications. This improvement will simplify the deployment of smart vision applications in automotive, sports and entertainment, consumer, robotics and machine vision, medical, and security/surveillance domains. Through a unique and energy-efficient hardware computation platform, automated hardware design for machine learning applications, and efficient implementation libraries, this project will improve both the feature set and efficiency of smart vision applications across a wide range of end-use cases. With the rapid growth in smart vision applications, this project will be a key enabling technology to support high-performance, energy efficient and scalable solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) applications promise to produce billions in revenue and trillions in global economic impact through improved efficiency, safety, energy, and labor costs. Wide deployment of customized computing in IoT applications will lead to substantial energy savings, and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, and a more sustainable growth model for deployment of intelligent sensor systems with thousands or millions of sensor nodes analyzing large volumes of input data.
    The proposed project focuses on the design of high performance, energy-efficient IoT computer vision platforms, design tools, and implementation libraries. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive design and implementation platform to meet performance and energy goals; however, there are two main challenges to their adoption (1) small FPGAs are cost-effective but insufficient to replace the efficient, low-cost ASICs for computation-demanding applications; large FPGAs can fulfill all computation demands, but are too expensive to meet IoT price points, and (2) design and development for FPGAs is challenging and require hardware design expertise. This project?s innovation targets these challenges. First, our proposed platform will combine a media ASIC for efficient video processing with a small cost-effective FPGA for custom machine learning. Second, our proposed domain specific high level synthesis will generate efficient machine learning accelerators for standard machine learning infrastructures quickly, limiting required hardware design expertise while out-performing general purpose design techniques. This project will leverage background expertise in hardware design, design tools, and machine learning to develop and demonstrate the advantages of hybrid computation platforms for smart vision applications in terms of performance, energy consumption, cost and physical size.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in addressing blood clots in the pulmonary
    artery. Venous thrombosis, comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
    embolism (PE), occurs with an incidence of approximately 1 per 1000 annually in
    adult populations. Estimates suggest that 60k -100k Americans die of DVT/PE (also
    called venous thromboembolism). The current treatments are high risk to the patients
    and very expensive to the health care systems. Current treatment methods involve
    the use of systemic or catheter-directed thrombolytic medications to break down
    the clot and restore blood flow. The use of these medications carries the risk
    of bleeding in different parts of the body which can lead to death. Open-heart
    surgery is another treatment method, but the high risk of this critical surgery
    requires highly skilled physicians and advanced equipment that may not be available
    in most hospitals. The proposed device is simple and intuitive and allows the
    physicians to complete the treatment and restore the blood flow in less than 30
    minutes of the patient arrival while other treatment methods take several hours
    for mechanical thrombectomy and several days for catheter-delivered thrombolysis.
    This will significantly reduce the total procedure cost by reducing the length
    of stay in the intensive care unit from the average of 2-3 days to only a few
    hours. \n\nThe proposed project advances the current of the art of Nitinol medical
    device design, fabrication, and evaluation. The proposed clot removal device targets
    pulmonary embolism which is a common disease and may lead to death. The proposing
    team has established the technologies and know-how to produce the core Nitinol
    components of device. These include a simulation-based design optimization methodology,
    which has been used for the design of the main blood clot capturing funnels from
    Nitinol. The team has established innovative non-conventional fabrication and
    post-processing heat treatment procedures. Based on the anatomy and functionality
    of the circulation system an innovative test set up has been fabricated that can
    replicate the blockage of arteries. To this end, human blood clots are created
    and inserted in the test apparatus for a later retrieval. One of the main innovations
    is a Nitinol structure designed to allow for a 7-fold increase in the diameter
    of the blood capturing device when deployed: when deployed these Nitinol elements
    can expand from 2mm to 14mm in diameter, without any balloon or other external
    force. This innovative functionality has never been achieved before and is essential
    for the atraumatic functionality of the proposed device. This has been achieved
    by developing a mathematical method to systematically calculate the shape and
    size of laser cutting feature on a tube of Nitinol. With proper heat treatment,
    this tube can be formed to produce the two capturing baskets. The team has also
    used additive manufacturing and advanced computer simulation to create a test
    setup for in vitro testing of the capturing device."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable
    video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes (TPMs)
    through the use of an electrostatically actuated deformable membrane mirror (DMM).
    As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), TPMs achieve very high spatial
    resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam to excite fluorescence via
    the simultaneous absorption of two low energy infrared photons to stimulate emission
    in the visible. Because of the increased resolution, and increased penetration
    of infrared light into tissue compared with other LSM methods, TPMs have become
    widely accepted for use in the medical industry, specifically for dermatology
    and neurology. The technology developed for this project will address the $500
    million LSM market by delivering a low-cost, electrically tunable optic capable
    of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an order of
    magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities enabled
    by this technology will result in an advancement of microscopy techniques and
    diagnostic methods, thereby reducing diagnostic time and patient discomfort. Other
    markets that can easily be addressed by this technology include laser marking
    and engraving, endoscopes, optical coherence tomography, and machine vision. \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project will be the development of high-power capable
    coatings for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based deformable mirrors.
    Because these mirrors consist of a thin membrane with a reflective surface, standard
    glass coating processes for solid substrates are incompatible. Instead, the surface
    material for the mirror must be deposited within one of the many fabrication steps
    for the DMM. This project will address the unique challenges of developing high-reflectance
    coatings and incorporate them into the existing DMM fabrication process. The project
    involves four key objectives: 1) developing gold coated deformable mirrors, 2)
    developing protected silver coated deformable mirrors, 3) measuring key performance
    parameters, and 4) measuring and defining the power handling capability and damage
    thresholds of gold and silver DMMs. The anticipated result will be a fully characterized
    DMM capable of long operation under the high-power femtosecond laser illumination
    regime used in two photon microscopes."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditions automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars cost saving from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions, making positive contribution to the planet?s climate and environment. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This projects represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in the underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count, and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors (TruePODS) in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two thirds of all
    those affected by dementia. Despite that Alzheimer's disease is the single most
    expensive disease in the US and falls are the leading cause of hospitalization
    in Alzheimer's care, current tools offer little support. Although 3/4 of elderly
    fallers will experience a repeat fall, solutions like bed alarms and wearable

    techniques developed to robustly handle night-vision camera operation, occlusion,
    and non-standard human pose. Technical success will be measured by <1% missed
    detection and <50% false positive rate from this feasibility study. This first
    accuracy threshold will define a lower bound where, as has been demonstrated repeatedly
    in the deep-learning paradigm, accuracy will continue to improve as more data
    is collected."

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve and automate cognitive health screening mechanisms used in hospital facilities, by designing and validating a smart chair and a smart wearable based health data-centric novel solution. U.S. population has more than 16 million people (this is rapidly growing further) living with cognitive impairment. There is alarming fact that people with cognitive impairment report more than three times as many hospital stays as individuals with other health conditions. These are driving development of improved cognitive health assessment solutions, that will detect subtle signs of cognitive decline early in daily life. Motivated by these markets in demand, this project is designed to develop a system for advanced and remote screening and monitoring of cognitive health, and also enabling gamified user interaction for cognitive rehabilitation. The developed technology has large potential to help elderly people prone to levels of dementia (from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease), and slowly rehabilitating patients dealing with cognitive decline (stroke survivors and cancer patients under treatment). The designed platform and cognitive scoring algorithms developed in this project will be tested and validated with real patient study at hospital facility.


    The proposed project is a research, development and clinical studies effort to design and validate an advanced and remote screening, monitoring and rehabilitation solution for cognitive health. Such cognitive health management system will be achieved by technological innovation in multi-modal sensing and machine learning based behavioral data analytics from a smart chair and a custom wearable device (used separately), along with cognitive psychology driven gamified interactions and interventions. The smart chair system will capture patient non-verbal response and stress patterns, when answering to cognitive questionnaire. The smart wearable system (used with a few custom Bluetooth beacons in proximity) will analyze normalcy, forgetfulness, confusion in patient, while performing daily life cognitive tasks (such as baking a cake or cookie) in home-like kitchen facility in hospital. The main research objective includes two novel cognitive health scoring mechanism from user response with chair based cognitive questionnaire, and wearable based cognitive task performance quality. It will also design user interactions and interventions for cognitive rehabilitation and behavior reinforcement. This is a very impactful project with team's direct ongoing collaboration with hospital and neurologist, and access to large number of patients with range of cognitive disabilities (in accordance with IRB and HIPAA compliance).

    This STTR Phase I project looks to create a solution to the vast problem that hernia has become in the United States by developing a system that prevents hernia before it occurs. There are an estimated 300,000 hernia repairs performed each year in the US. Incisional hernia (IH) occurs in up to 70% in high-risk populations. The hernia epidemic is significant and is linked to reduced quality of life and $3.2 billion/year in healthcare expenditures for hernia repair. IH can be prevented using prophylactic mesh, which involves placement of tensioned mesh to reinforce abdominal fascia closures before herniation occurs. Prophylactic mesh has been shown to reduce the risk of IH from 35.9% to 1.5%. However, although prophylactic mesh produces outstanding results, it has not become widely adopted in part due to the technical challenge that the procedure poses and added operative time. This project aims to create a system that makes the prophylactic mesh procedure simpler, more reliable, and faster. This project offers an efficient solution to the hernia epidemic by addressing key surgeon-level barriers to adoption of prophylactic mesh and therefore will foster more widespread use of the procedure. Broader use of hernia prevention will improve outcomes, quality of life, and reduce the costs associated with IH.

    This project proposes the development of a hand-held system that simplifies and reduces the time to perform prophylactic mesh augmentation by integrating multiple discrete operative tasks including locating, tensioning, and affixing mesh onto the abdominal fascia. The system provides an optimized strategy for prophylactic mesh placement by leveraging biomechanical principles of both the abdominal wall and mesh to provide a quick, standardized, and reliable method to strengthen abdominal incisions and as a result minimize the risk of herniation. The system is comprised of three main components: the applicator, the fastener-anchor, and the mesh itself. The fastener-anchor represents a core functionality of the technology while serving two purposes: (1.) interaction/engagement and subsequent tension-setting of the mesh via the applicator system; and (2.) penetration of the fascia and affixation of the mesh onto the fascia. The applicator is a simple, ergonomic tool that interfaces with the fastener-anchors, allowing the surgeon to control the spatial position, tension, and placement of the mesh. This project aims to accomplish two main goals: (1.) to refine the device design, including achieving optimal security and reliability of engagement between the applicator and the fastener-anchors and (2.) to assess the biomechanical strength and speed of the proposed technology compared to current standards of care. Through iterative device prototyping, testing, and refinement, a fully functional device will be developed.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the storage of hydrogen on a novel material produced from silicon - the same substance used to make solar panels and computer chips. This unique and patented approach has the potential to eclipse all prior methods of hydrogen storage in terms of pressure, temperature, safety, cost, and convenience. Silicon is earth-abundant and benign to humans - it is even promotes healthy skin, hair, and fingernails. The implication of hydrogen-in-silicon is that fuel cell-powered vehicles, homes, and electronics can be far more efficient and clean than any other source of energy. Of great significance is that this technology will allow homeowners and businesses to generate their own hydrogen by splitting water using rooftop solar panels. By storing this as hydrogen-in-silicon a home can be run overnight or for many days during a cloudy spell. Hydrogen can replace the batteries in portable electronics so they can last up to 20 days without a recharge - far longer than with batteries. And if the rooftop system is of sufficient size, one can produce the hydrogen needed for a fuel cell vehicle, such as those already on the market. The implications of this are far-reaching, allowing complete energy independence for all, for all time to come, with minimal environmental impact and using almost completely renewable and low-cost resources which are easy to recycle.


    Porous silicon is easy to synthesize but requires a catalyst to recharge from a gaseous source. The introduction of the catalyst is critical as it must be controlled spatially and positioned to effect spillover onto and off of silicon. Density Functional Theory studies show this is energetically favorable and first-order macroscopic calculations indicate that recharge can be effected in 3.5 minutes at 8 bar and 250 C. The overall energy difference between fully-charged and fully-discharged silicon-hydrogen is an amazingly low 1 kcal/mol. The energy barrier is the strong H-H bond which dominates the kinetics. The course of this project is to strategically place palladium atoms at specific sites on the matrix of porous silicon so that it can mediate the H-H bond energy and allow spillover onto the 800 m^2/gm surface area of microporous silicon. This has been patented but never demonstrated in the laboratory, which is why this funding from NSF is needed. A further goal of this work is to demonstrate the viability of low-cost silicon using metallurgical grade material instead of the single-crystal silicon which has been used to date.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide an affordable mobile digital pathology
    solution to pathologists in order to facilitate their clinical practices in disease
    diagnosis, peer consultations, tumor board preparations, research and education.
    The low-cost smartphone based portable pathology slide scanner is a complementary
    solution to current high throughput expensive digital pathology equipment to allow
    whole slide imaging to penetrate across all tiers of market. Given the high owning
    rate of mobile devices, the increasing processing and transmission speed, and
    the versatility of mobile apps, this device brings whole slide imaging at fingertips
    of individual pathologists. This greatly simplifies intra- and inter- institutional
    consultations and tumor board preparations, which enhances our fundamental understanding
    of disease causes and in turn leads to possible cures with improved clinical outcomes.
    The device also reduces the needs for physical transport of glass slides or tissue
    blocks to centralized digital imaging equipment. It also provides strong support
    on timely and accurate diagnosis, especially for those remote to digital imaging
    equipment. Moreover, this study provides an effective approach for teaching foundational
    skills of whole slide imaging to the next-generation pathologists.\n \nThe proposed
    project is to validate the technical feasibility of using smartphone based portable
    slide scanner for acquiring pathological slide images with the optical performance
    comparable or close to those by commercial high-end slide scanners. This device
    is based on an innovative zoom-microscope design, where elastomer-liquid lenses
    with low optical aberration are used for changing the zoom ratio. This portable
    device can reach the optical magnification of 10X-40X and nearly diffraction-limited
    resolution with small lens diameters (<10mm), meeting the imaging requirement
    by pathologists. In this study, a prototype will be developed to demonstrate image
    acquisition, scanning, and transmission capabilities using representative mobile
    devices on the market. The minimal resolvable feature size under each magnification
    will be examined and compared with those of high-end commercial slide scanners.
    The minimal magnification increment based on the selected actuation mechanism
    will be experimentally determined. The images of pathological slides acquired
    under the same magnification or different magnifications will be stitched together
    to generate a large field-of-view while retaining the resolution. The stitched
    images will be sent to pathologists to solicit feedbacks for iterative design
    optimization."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hyper-personalized, clinical,
    and evidence-based blood transfusion decision support tool to reduce unnecessary
    transfusions, transfusion-related complications, and transfusion related expenditures.
    Blood transfusions are the most commonly prescribed medical procedure in the US,
    and cost our healthcare system $30 billion annually. The cost of unnecessary transfusions
    is estimated at no less than $15 billion each year. These figures double when
    including the cost of treating transfusion-related complications. In the era of
    evidence-based medicine, transfusion practices remain highly subjective with significant
    clinical variation. \n\nThe proposed project aims to address a critical un-met
    need in the hospitals related to blood transfusion by developing a comprehensive
    clinical evidence-driven decision support system that would empower the physician
    with a near real-time laboratory, clinical, diagnostic and prognostic information,
    integrated within a usable interface. The long-term goal of the project is to
    minimize the incidence of unnecessary blood transfusions to improve patient outcomes

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses a major obstacle and opportunity in the present nanotechnology boom, the need for improved microscope capabilities.  The growth of public investment in nanotechnology, from zero in 2000 to $68 billion in 2012, reflects the technical and commercial advantages of miniaturizing structural and chemical engineering to the nanoscale.  Missing are microscopes capable of resolving such structures and chemistries with sufficient accuracy: atomic-scale resolution in three dimensions (3D).  If successful, this project will demonstrate a new microscope that bridges this gap.  Based on atom microscope by projection (AMP) technology, the new AMP microscope will image the position and identity of every atom in 3D.  Complete atomic resolution will provide critical missing information to research scientists and more accurate inspection technology for manufacturing quality assurance.  Revealing atomic origins of properties, AMP microscopes will accelerate transition from trial-and-error experimentation to computer-based design, allowing significant savings of time and money in research and development.

    The intellectual merit of this project focuses on investigating feasibility of creating the first microscope capable of resolving the position and identity of every atom, in three dimensions, for billions of atoms per analysis.  This represents a 100-fold spatial resolution improvement and a 2-fold chemical resolution improvement.  AMP combines field-ion microscopy and field-evaporation time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  Prototype AMP experiments spatially imaged 100% of atoms with 3D sub-angstrom resolution but only chemically identified 57%.  This is the detection limit of using a multi-purpose detector for both spatial and chemical resolution.  To reach 100% atomic spatial and chemical resolution, this project will model, simulate, and experimentally test feasibility of novel ion optics to separate the spatial resolution information from the chemical resolution information, enabling use of single-purpose detectors for each and improving quality.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the alleviation of several current difficulties in the growth measurement of many bacterial species, especially anaerobic and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally occurring in the human body, and they have recently been shown to play critical roles in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response, and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases, such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is therefore a large unmet need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows. The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million and growing; the proposed technology will expand that market to fields it has never served.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop technology for measuring growth of many bacterial samples in a format much smaller than currently available high-throughput devices. The rise of systems and computational biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data; the variety of microbes in the human body necessitates such an approach. However, this type of data is currently nearly impossible to collect in anaerobic and other specialized environments. This project aims to bring high-throughput growth measurement techniques to these environments by creating simplified, miniaturized hardware paired with advanced real-time analysis and control software. The project?s first objective is to refine a novel proof-of-concept optical density measurement method to achieve accuracy and precision comparable to traditional techniques, and verify using bacterial growth and inorganic liquid testing. The next goal is to design a hardware enclosure small and robust enough to allow compatibility with the smallest and most taxing environments. Finally, software will be developed to manage a high number of bacterial experiments (and devices) running in parallel without sacrificing data fidelity or high resolution. It is anticipated that the resulting high-throughput measurement system will greatly expand researchers' abilities to characterize microbes of increasing clinical relevance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a novel clinical genomics software analysis platform that may help reduce or eliminate some of the most significant challenges associated with genetic testing. In the US, genomics plays a role in 9 of the 10 leading causes of death including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. As such, genetic testing is growing very rapidly, as are some of the associated challenges of scale, performance, cost and quality.  Genomic medicine and genetic testing are key underpinnings of precision medicine, which may help lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention of complex diseases and disorders. This feasibility study targets the development of an advanced analysis software platform to address analysis bottlenecks and ultimately improve time-to-treatment. The team will determine feasibility based on prototyping key technologies and methods to address current state limitations and point towards an improved future-state approach.  The study will be done in close collaboration with actual clinical genomics users to deliver clear and compelling benefits to the target market and end-users and to provide a high-value solution to the rapidly growing market segment.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to design and prototype a novel genomics software analysis platform.  It will include access to a large work bench of bioinformatics applications and performance optimized clinical analysis workflows running on scalable public cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant computing infrastructure. The platform will be developed following the software-as-a-service model, designed to optimize performance and costs for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The project will entail development of advanced proprietary computational algorithms to parallelize execution of analysis tasks, and the creation of highly optimized genomics analysis workflows. These workflows will result in dramatic time-savings as well as reduced costs compared to current state approaches. Project efforts also will focus on the development of sophisticated resource provisioning logic to exploit scale and cost optimization running on public cloud infrastructure. In addition, the project will include the feasibility of developing a dual-purpose platform for R&D and clinical usage for faster testing and adoption of newer and advanced tools and procedures. The technology will help to improve patient care by delivering results substantially faster, with higher quality and at lower cost. Additionally, users will be able to construct and validate custom analysis workflows that meet HIPAA, CLIA-CAP, and other clinical requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a confocal optical microscope with two-dimensional topographical profiling and multiple spectroscopic modes in a single, affordable precision instrument. The system will make a major impact in the $6.2 billion microscope market, with a near-term market penetration potential of over 5%, and significant growth potential. This technology will span the needs of materials science research laboratories through quality control in manufacturing to supply chain monitoring. Integration of topographic mapping with a diverse set of spectroscopic tools enables comprehensive materials analysis at the micron and submicron scale. Users will be able to identify features and defects in electronic, optoelectronic, and structural devices, as well as coatings, tubing, devices, disks, and specialty mirrors. Combinatorial materials and chemical research will also be furthered by the ability to acquire several spectroscopic maps with a single instrument. Societal impacts include practical improvements in the design and manufacture of components and systems.  Because of its compact size and low cost, the microscope can be used in schools at all levels, providing students with experience in measuring properties of complex objects and helping prepare them for careers in various research, development, and production settings.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the advancement of optical microscopy into the realm of spectroscopic and surface analysis of topographically complex structures. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), for example, have micron-to-millimeter features that can be analyzed by the developed instrument. The key innovation is the development of precision profiling and its integration with multiple spectroscopic interrogation methods. This profiling innovation centers on the capture of two-dimensional optical images with an array detector from each point on a sample and the conversion of the image properties to a vertical focus error, which is then corrected in a subsequent spectroscopic scan. The instrument can then provide Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and topographic surface (morphology) mapping of a sample, with diffraction-limited resolution. Research objectives include integration of optical profiling with spectroscopic scanning to produce accurate two-dimensional spectra from topographically rough samples, and automation of the image capture and analysis software. The instrument is designed to capture the surface topography and spectrum of a sample with tens of thousands of sample points in a few minutes and with 10-50 nanometer vertical accuracy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the expansion of autonomous unmanned aerial systems (UAS, or drones) to new maritime operational environments and commercial markets. The proposed technology will enable small UAS to operate from vessels moving at sea, without the need for a dedicated pilot or installed hardware, even while far from shore and beyond the reach of established communication networks. Small UAS can offer the same aerial perspective provided by manned helicopters at a fraction of the size, cost, and risk. Real-time aerial imagery from UAS will supply maritime operators with invaluable information about their surroundings at sea, which is not available by any other means. This information is critical for many maritime applications, including fishing, ocean monitoring, scientific exploration, maritime surveillance, and search, and rescue. This information will offer a particularly large and immediate impact for 98% of worldwide commercial fishing vessels (those that do not carry embarked manned helicopters for fish-finding) by dramatically reducing their fuel costs; providing net economic and environmental gains for the industry.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop algorithms and software to enable small UAS autonomously and reliably land onto a moving platform at sea. Commercially-available small UAS can offer invaluable real-time aerial imagery for maritime operators. But, this technology is not currently in widespread use due to technological barriers. In particular, the key enabling technology is the ability to autonomously and reliably land a small UAS onto a moving platform. The research objective is to develop algorithms and software that enable small UAS to autonomously operate from moving vessels at sea. Computer vision algorithms automatically detect the host vessel and the dedicated landing area. Data fusion algorithms estimate the relative drone-boat position and orientation in real time, including compensation for vessel roll, pitch, & heave. Precision control algorithms optimize the drone?s trajectory for save, reliable, autonomous launch and landing. A prototype system will be built by integrating the STTR-developed software with commercially available hardware components.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is widespread adoption of a technology with a
    direct cost-­savings in healthcare. It is estimated that nearly 5,000 patients
    are harmed each year due to wrong-patient errors in medical imaging. Additionally,
    even a 10% improvement in efficiency in radiologists' performance would translate
    to ~$900 million savings to the overall health care budget. Finally, an indirect,
    but impactful outcome is the potential to improve the relevance and accuracy of
    medical imaging reports. It is anticipated that pairing the medical imaging studies
    to the patient photographs of the patient's face and upper body, where tubes and
    wires are often located, can provide important clinical information in a rapid
    and efficient manner. In the broadest terms, this novel technology can be translated
    to provide patient authentication and identification for the digital data that
    is being generated by hundreds of new medical devices. \n\nThe proposed project
    concerns the seamless integration of a patient Identification system in hospitals
    to improve patient safety and radiology throughput. The intellectual merit of
    this work is a transformative approach overcoming the failure of existing patient
    identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system
    to improve patient care. Toward this goal this work will develop an imaging synchronization
    technology that automatically obtains and embeds a photograph of the patient's
    face and upper body onto the x-ray taken during an imaging examination. To test
    and establish feasibility, the initial target of this technology will be portable
    x-ray machines brought to the patient's bedside in high volume settings. Specifically,
    the proposed work will 1) incorporate face-­tracking technology to ensure the
    patient's face and torso are always captured by the camera, 2) conduct a feasibly
    study in a real-world setting by deploying the technology on ~6 portable radiography
    machines at a large academic hospital where it will be integrated with the hospital's
    Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), and 3) perform preliminary
    workflow studies. The long term objectives are to 1) increase the detection rate
    of wrong-­patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric
    identifier with medical imaging studies; and 2) decrease turn-­around time by
    decreasing interpretation time."

    Research Phase 1 project is the possibility of inexpensive clean water generation
    from sea and brackish water.  With rapidly increasing world population, portable
    water will be one of the most important technological challenges of this century.
    There is no unique ?one size fits all? approach to desalination. Many factors
    such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment
    requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting
    the desalination technology to be implemented. The carbon nanotube enhanced membrane
    distillation proposed here is a relatively low temperature process where industrial
    waste heat and solar heating can be used for desalination. Small water heaters
    such as the natural gas heaters used in homes can be used to generate high quality
    drinking water along with what is needed for domestic consumption. Another major
    application of this technology is in oil and gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing
    or fracking is a water-intensive process. A typical frack well uses several million
    gallons of water over its lifetime and generates a highly saline ?produced water?.
    \  With its ability to handle high salt concentrations, the proposed approach
    is a viable alternative for treating this waste.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this project are to utilize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create breakthrough
    membrane properties for desalination via membrane distillation (MD). In MD, a
    hydrophobic porous membrane separates a hot salt water feed and a cold permeate
    stream.  As the heated brine passes on the membrane and is partially transformed
    to water vapor. The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution
    from entering the pores. However, freed from hydrogen bonding the water vapor
    passes through and is condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The novel
    membranes referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membranes (CNIM) will be
    developed by immobilizing CNTs into membrane pores where they will serve as molecular
    transporters and sorbents, thus providing additional pathways for water vapor
    transport. The other major advantage of CNIM is that it is less prone to fouling
    than conventional membranes. Key innovations of the proposal include the functionalization
    of CNTs for maximization of water vapor transport while minimizing fouling.  Additional
    objectives include the study of fouling behavior of some commercially important
    water samples such as sea water, power plant effluents and produced water. Finally,
    a process optimization tool will be developed to optimize CNIM-MD design."

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will generate a new nanoparticle characterization system with the ability to assess the size, length-to-width ratio, zeta potential, and concentration of solution-based nanoparticle (or molecular) samples with state-of-the-art accuracy, precision, and resolution, all on a single platform. The primary need for new nanoparticle characterization instrumentation is driven by the increasing utility and benefit of nanoparticles in healthcare and medicine, including nanoparticle drug delivery, nanoscale particle/molecule drugs and therapies, and nanoparticle-based imaging and diagnostics agents. The prototype system developed under this program will be targeted toward the general nanoparticle characterization market, presently estimated at ~$500M, which includes applications in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, nanoparticle manufacturing, R&D, and academic research. The developed system will not only improve solution-based nanoparticle characterization, but streamline characterization processes and provide new insights with regard to sample characterization, optimization, and utilization within the nanoparticle field.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a completely new and innovative particle characterization system for which there is no equivalent, capable of automated, high-resolution, solution-based particle assessments at the single-molecule level.  The developed system will enable the ability to quickly characterize a large number (hundreds to thousands) of particles/molecules in solution in order to assess the distribution within the sample. These goals will be reached by developing, building, and validating a complete and fully functioning alpha-prototype system and then demonstrating the functionality and utility of the new system by characterizing solution-based particle- and molecule-containing samples that otherwise cannot be characterized with high resolution. Upon completing this program, an entirely new nanoparticle characterization instrument will be developed and validated that is ready for initial introductions into the nanoparticle field via industrial and academic communities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a disruptive tow tension control technology specifically designed for the unique processing variables of composite material manufacturing to solve the limiting factor of tension control the industry currently faces. In composites manufacturing multiple materials with different tensile strengths and elasticity are combined to make a stronger product, and the lack of affordable tension control has up to this point limited the speed and quality of finished products within the industry. By controlling tension there are fewer gaps, uneven tows, and breaks, resulting in higher quality end product and reduced scrap rates. The composites industry is forecasted to grow at a 7% compound annual growth rate to $10.9 billion in 2018 despite these manufacturing limitations. By removing the limiting factor of tension control it is estimated that production could expand 15%-25%, increasing the growth of this industry even further. With composites? primary and growing role in renewable energy, aerospace, construction, automobiles, pipe and tank, and consumer goods, a manufacturer?s ability to remove limitations to effectively meet demand without sacrificing quality will be critical. Expanded productivity will allow for greater innovation with composites within existing industries and promote their use in new industries.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on determining the feasibility of a Modular Tensioning Cartridge for composites manufacturing. The objectives of this project are 1) to determine if tension can be controlled near or at zero, 2) to achieve miniaturization of the unit for multiple use applications, and 3) to determine cost targets and economic feasibility. Research will be conducted to develop a load cell (sensing unit) capable of detecting minor (gram) changes in output in relation to key considerations of beam loading and sensing capability, through testing of multiple design, shape, and material combinations. Further research and testing will be conducted to discover heat dissipation requirements, fuzzing risks and solutions, and determine design and material requirements in order to achieve proper miniaturization of the full unit. Final research will be conducted to validate the economic value proposition of the unit to customers based on unit quality, size, performance, and service life in relation to cost and additional output/productivity generated. The team will determine the viability of load cell technology as a sensing device, and the combination of materials and design that will meet sizing, performance, and cost requirements.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will include
    a research program to prepare new materials for a novel sensor to detect when
    a water softener needs regeneration. The adoption of a low cost, accurate water
    hardness sensor can drive a substantial reduction in both the amount of salt released
    into municipal sewer systems and the amount of water used to rinse the resins.
    The patent-pending hardness sensor can replace more expensive and less effective
    components and approaches that are currently utilized by water softeners to initiate
    regeneration. This will enable penetration into markets which have been underserved
    due to environmental concerns about salt discharge. Manufacturers of softeners
    will benefit from the proposed hardness sensor, because it will modernize their
    regeneration controls while also improving water softening efficiency and environmental
    sustainability. Annual global water softener sales growth is around 8%. With a
    15-20% market penetration, sensor sales could be around $90 million (water softener
    model). The proposed development of ion-exchange fibers is expected to have applications
    beyond hardness sensors. The same approach can be used to make anion-exchange
    fibers that can be employed for the detection of nitrate in devices similar to
    softeners to remove nitrate from drinking water. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is the development of a new method for making ion-exchange fibers.
    The proposed work will build upon past research performed and will culminate in
    the development of commercially available cation-exchange fibers that can be used
    for hardness sensors and other applications. There is a substantial benefit of
    using the cation-exchange material of the hardness sensor. The sensor detects
    the electrical resistance of the entire mass of the cation exchange material between
    the electrodes. Earlier experiments indicate that cation-exchange fibers offer
    superior performance compared to membranes, but no commercially available fibers
    exist. After reliable fibers have been produced, they will be installed in hardness
    sensors to be evaluated using small column testing equipment at The University
    of Texas at El Paso, as well as in water softeners outside of the university to
    validate the salt and water savings potential. The proposed research will include
    not only sensor development, but also the measurement and control needed to automatically
    sense hardness and control regeneration in both a water softener resin bed and

    It is a critical challenge to locate an implanted device, interventional device,
    needle biopsy device, or lesion that is planned to be removed during a surgical
    procedure. The proposed study provides a way to overcome the abovementioned challenge
    by taking advantage of an internal sound source which can be directly visualize
    via a hybrid augmented reality technology. As an example of breast cancer surgery,
    a direct tumor visualization tool will greatly reduce the surgical time and improve
    the surgical outcome. This innovation will bring considerable market opportunity.
    According to the market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will
    reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual
    growth rate of 14.5%. With the value we potentially provide, our total addressable
    market is estimated to ~$200 million in 2020, which is a considerable and healthy
    market.  Other market including visualization of an interventional device or implanted
    device will further increase the value of the proposed innovation. \n\nThis proposed
    project is to develop an intraoperative tool to visually locate the breast tumor
    with high accuracy. In 2015, there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer,
    and an estimated 60,290 additional cases of noninvasive breast cancer. It is challenging
    for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially
    when the tumor is non-palpable. However, the current technologies cannot provide
    quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of
    that location. Therefore, it creates problems on a large re-excision rate, and
    a prolonged surgical time.  The project proposes to address these unmet needs
    by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can
    provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter
    variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization
    of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using
    acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to provide deep insights into the DNA of patients in one hour at one-fourth the cost. This will allow hospitals, clinics and research centers to delve faster into the genetic information of the patients and return essential insights to physicians, leading to faster decisions on therapy. Analyzing DNA data holds the promise of detecting several diseases and can also help in pinpointing their genetic origins, which will be key for treatment of vulnerable cases such as newborn babies, people with rare diseases, and pregnant women. By providing the analysis of whole DNA data in one hour as compared to several days, DNA tests can become mainstream, thereby reducing anxiety among patients and their relatives. As the number of patients for which deep DNA analysis will be required is doubling every year, this project aims to meet the exploding demands of large scale computational genomics of the future and enable deep DNA analysis for all patients.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use the power of state of the art cloud computing platforms to provide analysis for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data in one hour. Several key researchers have shown that data from WGS is a critical requirement for accurate insights and detailed analysis of underlying diseases for various diseases including leukemia, breast Cancer, ADHD, Alzheimer's, congenital heart disease, HIV susceptibility, as well as others as information in the non-coding region is required. However, the computational analysis for WGS data takes several days and will be the major bottleneck for utilizing key WGS data to personalize the treatment for the affected patient. This project aims to use several high performance computing techniques on the cloud that will be tailored for NGS analyses and can accelerate the process by more than 40 times. This project uses a disruptive technology that breaks algorithms to work independently on nodes on the cloud and the team has created a collection of software optimizations to improve the utilization of cloud resources. This toolbox of optimizations is being applied to commonly used software tools in computational genomics for faster analysis.

    computationally models the interaction of each sensor and target molecule, predicting
    protein mutations that improve binding to the desired molecule. It is possible
    to then rapidly construct and test vast numbers of these predicted sensors, identifying
    those with the requisite sensing and response characteristics in yeast. The resulting
    sensors will allow the rapid engineering of yeast strains by altering yeast cell
    behavior in response to the target chemical, making them powerful tools that have

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in helping people cultivate healthy lifestyles. Over the last few decades, an epidemic of lifestyle diseases has developed in the United States. Unhealthy lifestyles, such as inactivity, poor nutrition and sedentary behaviors are driving up the prevalence of chronic disease such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. As of 2012, about 117 million people had one or more chronic health conditions. Although chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes are among the most common and costly of all diseases, simply adopting healthy lifestyles can prevent many of these chronic diseases. About 86% of all health care spending in 2010 was for chronic medical conditions. Preventive approaches can offset current healthcare costs. However, prevention is typically implemented as labor-intensive coaching or mobile health apps that lack sufficient personalization to be effective. The technology platform being developed in this project will combine the best of both mobile and in-person coaching for a fraction of the cost of in-person coaching.

    The proposed project will help people to cultivate lifestyle changes. For a lifestyle disease patient, it is very difficult to change lifelong habits to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of a doctor or coach is a long standing problem. Several reminder and tracker apps attempt to help with compliance and adoption of healthy lifestyle. Unlike such solutions, our approach is unique in its ability to proactively intervene with highly targeted interventions at the right moment, which is when compliance is most likely. Such moments will be captured through the ability of the platform to incorporate context-sensitivity. The platform will understand the context of each patient and will enable the coach to deliver interventional messages at the right moment, thereby increasing the likelihood of compliance and assisting with formation of healthy habits. The platform also provides scalability without significant loss in personalization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to optimize and reduce agro-chemical and irrigation applications for the United States agricultural industry, reducing environmental contamination, and increasing overall crop health and production with a smart phone compatible miniaturized optical sensor. The diagnostic sensor, designed for use in the precision agriculture market sector, captures optical spectrographs of a plant that can be used to diagnose the overall health of the plant, and provide recommendations for optimizing care. In discerning whether a plant suffers from a nutrient deficiency, a water stress, or a disease pressure, the sensor provides a means for substantial commercial impact. By providing this market sector with the needed quantitative information to both specialize and optimize crop treatment plans, substantial agro-chemical and irrigation resources are saved. From a societal perspective, these commercial savings directly translate into reduced agro-chemical applications of crops, which help reduce eutrophication of environmental water bodies, protecting drinking water supplies. By optimizing irrigation usage, the sensor reduces irrigation demands, helping ensure the longevity of these sources of irrigation. By enabling big data analysis of optical spectrographs that correlate with underlying crop health conditions, the project provides insight into physiological factors governing crop health, advancing scientific understanding.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is directed towards miniaturizing high precision optical spectrophotometers, traditionally confined to laboratory usage, for use in precision agriculture. The agricultural industry struggles to identify or anticipate changes in crop health and take appropriate measures of response. As multiple environmental stressors or factors can cause similar visual symptoms in a crop, optimal decision-making becomes decidedly difficult, and can lead to costly commercial and societal impacts. In response to this problem, this project aims to first develop a handheld smart phone-based spectrophotometer for real time diagnosis of crop health. Afterwards, the capabilities of the device will be extensively tested in controlled greenhouse studies of crops under varying nutrient and hydration conditions. Finally, the data collected in these studies will be analyzed and benchmarked against gold standard techniques of assessment. From these studies, the performance of the optical sensor will be clearly assessed. Specifically, the degree to which the sensor can discern amongst varying environmental stressors affecting a crop, and also the degree to which the sensor can provide quantitative feedback about the severity of those stressors, will be provided.

    proposed flexible battery technology solves the major problems (e.g. mechanical
    failure, low capacity) of the existing battery designs for wearable/flexible electronics
    (e.g. smart watches, apparel, eye wear, and medical patches). Xerion Advanced
    Battery Corporation (XABC)?s battery design can potentially close the current
    technological gap between electronic devices and their supporting batteries and
    further accelerate the wearable/flexible electronics sector, which is expected
    to grow at 53.7% compounded annual growth rate. The development of this battery
    technology will provide important scientific insights and practical guidance towards
    various fundamental principles of battery designs such as stress handling, form
    factor adaptability, assembly, integration, and energy and power optimization.
    Furthermore, XABC?s novel battery fabrication technique, which utilizes a high
    throughput electroplating process to produce battery grade materials and electrodes,
    has the potential to drive innovations in other energy storage initiatives (e.g.
    high-energy, low-cost batteries for automotive) in both academia and industry.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes an
    innovative flexible battery design to meet the growing demand for wearable/flexible
    electronics.  The proposed flexible batteries are made of electrodes realized
    via directly electroplating high-quality, high-energy battery materials on current
    collectors. In most existing flexible batteries, battery materials are bonded
    by polymer binders, resulting in loose contacts during bending and thus loss of
    battery materials. In contrast, the electroplated materials are chemically bonded
    to the current collector, which significantly enhances the electrode integrity
    during repeated bending and deformation. Such strong bonding also enables fast
    electron transport in the electrode and thus boosts the battery power. Here, XABC
    will develop high-performance flexible batteries via its patented electroplating
    technique. Research will focus on investigating various aspects of the flexible
    battery design including electroplating optimization, current collector selection,
    battery assembly, and packaging. XABC will demonstrate capability of making fully
    packaged flexible battery prototypes with various form factors for flexible electronics
    and perform detailed electrochemical and mechanical characterization. The proposed
    flexible battery prototype is expected to show high energy, high power, and excellent
    capacity retention after thousands of bending and deformation cycles."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, bioabsorbable surgical
    clip and applicator for rapid closure of the dura mater in open and minimally
    invasive spine surgery. The dura mater is the protective membrane that covers
    the brain and spinal cord and contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Openings in
    the dura (durotomy) can result in CSF leakage which, if not repaired, can cause
    potentially fatal complications including spinal headaches, pseudomeningocele,
    and meningitis. Currently, the dura is closed using fine suture in a difficult
    and time-consuming process requiring upwards of 30 minutes of additional operating
    room time. Durotomies occur in approximately 10% of spinal surgeries and with
    1.7M spinal surgeries, closure of incidental durotomies costs the healthcare system
    an estimated $408M each year. Utilization of a bioabsorbable clip and applicator
    system for dural closure will significantly increase the rate of repair, simplify
    the work of clinicians, and reduce surgery time and overall costs to the healthcare
    system. Use of this technology could be expanded to closure of cranial dura, as
    well as other surgical specialties such as urology, OB/GYN, and general surgery.
    \n\nThe proposed project aims to develop a bioabsorbable, non-penetrating clip
    for rapid closure of the dura mater in spine surgery. The goal is to produce clips
    capable of closing dura and holding a water tight seal as compared to the current
    standard of care. This project will include developing a clip made entirely out
    of a biocompatible, bioabsorbable polymer that will safely degrade in the body
    after the dura has healed. The clips will also be radiolucent (invisible to x-ray
    and computed tomography imaging) to allow for unobstructed imaging of the surgical
    site. In addition, the clips will be non-penetrating to avoid lacerating the dura,
    reducing the risk of CSF leakage and possible fatal medical complications. This
    project also aims to develop an inexpensive, disposable applicator system that
    will apply the clips for dural closure. The applicator will be designed for use
    in both open and minimally invasive surgery and will house a reservoir of clips
    for complete dural closure without removal of the applicator from the surgical
    site for reloading."

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses a critical need in medicine ? the ability to deliver drugs selectively to parts of the body that need medication.  Targeted drug delivery improves patient outcomes by treating tissues locally while reducing overall exposure and side effects elsewhere. For example, a cream or lotion type product which moves anti-inflammatory drugs through skin specifically to an affected joint is better than taking a pill which medicates the entire body. Nanoparticles, especially liposomes (nanometer size water balloons consisting of a fatty wall surrounding an aqueous interior) are useful for targeted drug delivery because of their ability to move through biological barriers including skin. Unfortunately, use of liposomes is limited because the drug carrying capacity is too small, especially for water insoluble drugs.  Lipoleosomes are a new type of liposome with a much greater carrying capacity for drugs.  The objective of this project is to make lipoleosomes with ibuprofen, a water-insoluble drug and demonstrate the ability to move ibuprofen through skin for localized treatment of joints and muscles. This will be valuable for developing a lotion product to treat arthritis and injuries while avoiding stomach problems.

    The creation of lipoleosomes resulted from a remarkable discovery ? that under certain conditions, flat fatty layers (lipid bilayers) existing in microemulsions can be reshaped by hydration into spherical liposome form. Because microemulsion lipid bilayers can contain large amounts of water-insoluble (hydrophobic) compounds (easily up to 65%), so can the product liposomes. Previously, hydrophobic drug content of liposomes rarely exceeded 5%. In light of the extraordinarily greater drug capacity, the new liposomes were named lipoleosomes, indicating a liposome into which organic compounds (oleo) have been inserted.  It is a scientific curiosity that some microemulsion lipid layers reshape to give membrane structures because in the past, hydration had only been known to give filled emulsion droplets which do not have the important biological features of liposomes. In this project, the quality and yield of lipoleosomes and their biological characteristics will be improved by understanding the influence of precursor microemulsion properties and processing conditions. This will result in the availability of new, biologically effective lipoleosomal ibuprofen compositions and methods of synthesis, plus physical and biometric data that supports submission of a new drug application for a topical ibuprofen lotion or cream. Establishing lipoleosomes as a new type of nanoparticle has implications for many other drugs and for routes of administration other than dermal.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project would be to make it safer to send premature babies home after their stay in the NICU. They will be more likely to grow and thrive while they regain valuable bonding time with their parents. The risk of having to readmit babies would go down. Complications and maybe even SIDS could be reduced, because we would have a better way to measure and understand the development of these babies after they leave the hospital but continue to mature for the first year. Our physicians are excellent, but their decisions can only be as reliable as the information they are provided. Many cases doctors are forced to make difficult decisions between keeping a baby longer at greater cost and further separation or sending the baby home to begin a new life, but at the risk that the baby's central nervous system may not be quite up to the job of keeping the basic heart, lung and temperature at the right levels. This project will give physicians better more accurate information to reduce the guesswork and keep the babies safe.

    The proposed project will result in a miniature throw away sensor strip that nurses stick on the outer eyelid of a premature baby. The technology, called OMT allows us to read the innermost control signals of the deepest and most important part of the brain called the brainstem. Neuroscientists now know that one of the most important jobs that the brainstem does is to help control the most basic primitive life functions such as changing the rate of breathing, body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate.  Develop a thin film sensor and instrument that is capable of successfully recording brainstem biosignals in premature babies, both technically and physiologically, and; demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between pre-terms with and without discharge problems The project plan is to complete the design and assembly of the instrument and to sample the data from a late pre-term infant to determine basic viability of signal and satisfactory detection. Following that the team will produce a small lot of sensors and several test units to measure 9-18 young patients in three cohorts. This basic validation of the instrument and clinical value is the key next step to successful commercialization of the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel
    approaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel
    dressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically
    from other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as
    it is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial
    properties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery
    therapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are
    intermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.
    Successfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the
    serious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with
    chronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related
    costs of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.
    The proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and
    processing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.
    The dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal
    chronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be
    explored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate
    commercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for
    wound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings
    will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will apply the novel nanotechnology
    to the problem of pneumonia and sepsis.  Pneumonia is the second worldwide cause of death and first among children under 5 years old, and is the number one cause of sepsis. The mainstay
    of treatment is empiric antibiotic selection, which increases multidrug resistant organisms
    and may not appropriately address the cause of the infection, thus potentially increasing
    mortality. The broader impact of diagnosing the cause of pneumonia at the bedside or in the field within 10 minutes with no need for a central laboratory will produce a new paradigm and decrease patient mortality, cost, and multi-drug resistant organisms. The technology will move the field to a new era of screening high risk patients for pneumonia, before severe infection or sepsis occurs. The technology will also serve as the missing tool to greater understand the natural history and epidemiology of pneumonia, as the causative organism in pneumonia is only found in half of patients at present. The annual cost for pneumonia and sepsis in United States hospitals is $30 billion.

    The technology uses nanotechnology to greatly increase the surface area for nanoscale binding events that are measured with changes of impedance which are then correlated to a concentration of the target biomarker.  The technology will move the pneumonia field from the current qualitative result to a quantitative reading. The detection of common causes of pneumonia will be accomplished from a drop of blood, urine, and/or saliva. Synthetic solutions with pneumonia biomarkers will be constructed.  Analytical parameters including accuracy, precision, linearity, calibration, limit of blank, limit of detection, functional sensitivity, and interfering substances will be evaluated.  In addition, the optimum manufacturing process for a disposable sensor cartridge will be determined. This will include an assessment of dry versus wet biochemistry, appropriate manufacturing method, accuracy, calibration, storage, temperature, ageing, and final design concepts. The goal of the proposed research is to produce an alpha prototype of the sensor cartridge that can detect the pneumonia biomarkers from synthetic solutions of blood, urine, and saliva.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop and provide novel computation capabilities to the marketplace that mimic and apply the way our brain computes beyond deep learning systems and much closer to how the brain actually operates. Although
    the technology is initially targeted for the commercial drone market, the technology can be applied to consumer and hobbyist drone market, self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous navigation and guiding systems with obstacle avoidance for
    robots, ballistics tracking and counter-drone capabilities for military and defense, and surveillance and counter-drone for public safety and security. This project has the potential to revolutionize robotic and machine vision by providing capabilities that simply do not exist today.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates novel ways, algorithms and software implementations that leverage expertise in natural vision systems, deep learning and machine learning to make use of electro-optical sensors, which
    respond in new ways to form the basis of an Airborne Based Sense and Avoid (ABSAA) system. It leverages the benefits of bio-inspired computation, and investigates how to combine information from multiple sensors in a common representation. The project will study novel ways to achieve robust detection, segmentation, clustering, discrimination and classification with these novel sensors. It will also extend methods and algorithms for state estimation, tracking and prediction in the inherent sensor representation. The project will also address the real-time constraints and will attempt to leverage recent hardware implementations, which can provide a complete embedded system for ABSAA system that is low SWaP (size, weight and power) and in the long run, low cost as well because it has the potential to benefit from economy of scale. The theoretical and algorithmic advances generated by the project have the potential to affect
    machine and robotic vision well beyond the project focused application to ABSAA.

    culture does not need to be terminated prematurely after 3 or 4 weeks (due to
    accumulation of dead cells and cell debris resulting in reduced product quality
    and clogged membranes in current devices).  The novel compact cell settler has
    a small size and footprint compared with other cell retention devices, and increases
    the likelihood of wider adaptation of the technology by a larger number of biomanufacturing
    companies and reduces the cost of manufacture of therapeutic biologics.  As biosimilar
    price competition is expected for successful products that are coming off patent
    protection,  reducing the cost of their manufacture using superior cell culture
    techniques will enable increased affordability of these drugs to a wider patient
    population. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel compact
    and more efficient method of scaling up inclined settler technology, which has
    been scaled up inefficiently as rectilinear lamellar settlers.  While a few biological
    manufacturers have successfully adapted the protruding lamellar settlers to manufacture
    therapeutic biologics from recombinant mammalian cells in high cell density perfusion
    bioreactors, the proposed novel compact cell settler is predicted to achieve the
    required separation of dead cells and cell debris from a high cell density perfusion
    bioreactor with a much smaller footprint compared to the original inclined lamellar
    settler design. Three key objectives for the research are to 1) demonstrate that
    the novel compact cell settler can achieve and maintain high viable cell densities
    indefinitely, 2) determine the maximum perfusion rate that maintain the high viable
    cell density indefinitely for smaller settlers of two different sizes, and 3)
    develop new scaling laws that can predict the size requirements of the settlers
    for larger commercial-scale bioreactors.  These objectives will be accomplished
    by a systematic experimental plan to investigate the performance of the novel
    settlers at two different sizes and for two different mammalian cell types."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on an automated painting and overspray capture system is a significant increase in the health/safety of construction workers and profitability/production efficiency of the construction industry. Painting workers suffer from increased short and long term health problems due to exposure to paint fumes, including increased potential for certain cancers and cognitive damage. Construction projects are delayed due to injuries, lack of available skilled labor, and prohibitive costs. A system that can eliminate major health and safety risks by capturing harmful fumes as well as increase productivity by autonomously working alongside skilled workers will have a significant positive impact on the construction industry and workers. This innovation could open the construction industry up to myriads of intelligent, autonomous solutions that improve health, safety, quality, and production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will work to establishing the technical and commercial feasibility of an automated system to paint and capture overspray. The SBIR project will focus on the device responsible for directing paint from the spraying apparatus to the surface to be painted and containment of overspray and harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The health hazards of paint fumes and airborne VOCs are apparent through the increased risk of certain cancers and long-term cognitive damage suffered by painters. Additionally, painting at heights on ladders or other lift equipment presents a safety and efficiency problem. The research objectives of this SBIR are to develop a system that can effectively contain overspray/paint fumes while being small/lightweight enough for use by a robotic platform. Extensive flow analysis will be conducted with experimental geometry and flow visualization techniques on benchtop test rigs to evaluate geometry and flow characteristics. Successful benchtop test designs will be further tested on a robotic platform to evaluate system-level performance for paint quality, over spray containment, and airborne VOCs.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a web-based application that assists prospective and new college students in the challenging decision of the major/minor choice for their college degree. Studies have shown that 20 to 50 percent of students enter college as undecided in terms of intended majors, and subsequently an astonishing 75 percent actually change their major at least once before graduation. These statistics illustrate one of the key factors that hinder on-time degree completion and boost total student debt to the trillion dollar level. The proposed system administers a brief but highly-regarded personality quiz, then displays majors and minors that align with the results of that quiz. The student makes selections from this list, then clicks a button to see groups of corresponding semester-by-semester shortest-path degree plans with labels indicating their alignment with the personality quiz result. This easy-to-use approach empowers students to make early, well-informed college career choices. Colleges across the country will want to purchase and install this software for many reasons, including: to show their commitment to helping students avoid the all-too-common difficulties and expense of poor college career decisions, to obtain improved graduation rates, and to improve administrative resource planning for future semesters via a database of their students' plans.

    The key technical innovations of this software system include integration of a personality interest assessment profile within a degree planning system, assignment of interest vectors to individual college courses along with the utilization of this information in the development of degree plans that are well-aligned with student interest vectors, the use of state-of-the-art mathematical optimization techniques in order to quickly generate shortest-path degree plans, and automated multiple-plan generation followed by clustering and cluster labeling within this plan collection in order to provide a simple interface that allows a student to easily navigate through a collection of alternative degree plans. These technical innovations are made possible by the many years of experience in algorithm development by the company team members, and represent an approach not seen in the very limited collection of existing academic planning software, which tends to focus on cumbersome drag-and-drop technology that discourages the exploration of alternative degree paths. The goal of this research is to provide an easy-to-customize and easy-to-install degree planning system that will be readily affordable by any academic institution and that will allow prospective and undecided students to discover and explore in detail - with just a few mouse clicks - those college careers that are aligned with their personal interests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) will be to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms.  These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, helping in the movement to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given.  Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas and deliver substances to live animals or humans.  In addition, the proposed system will lead to increased productivity, allowing the poultry industry to meet the world's growing nutritional needs.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes the development of technologies for screening and vaccinating live animals.  This proposal brings innovation to the care of food animals allowing producers to move away from flock health, focusing instead on the care of individual animals.  Individualized care is not practiced due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large-scale commercial hatchery operation.  The overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a system that safely and effectively processes 100,000 chicks per hour, preform health checks and target recognition, and delivers a vaccine to individual chicks.  This specific SBIR project will focus on two main goals:  1) Development of an automated system to determine the health status of a day-of-age chick.  The system will recognize unhealthy chicks and target them for removal.  2) Development of a targeting system to determine the position of a chick using key features and provide the system?s master controller with the coordinates for proper delivery of vaccines and/or biologicals to the correct location on the chick.  Achieving these objectives will allow for further development of the product, adding in multiple lines for processing, leading to a fully commercial product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be seen in the adoption of solar energy as a cost-competitive alternative to non-renewable energy sources. While solar energy costs have been dramatically reduced, the use of the most efficient cells is limited by manufacturing costs. The need for efficient cells - solar cells that deliver more watts per area - can be seen when considering system costs. Higher efficiency reduces all costs related to area: module components, support structures, labor, land, etc. Silicon Heterojunctions (SHJ) cells deliver leading conversion efficiencies but are manufactured with processes that require multiple passes through very expensive machines to deposit required semiconductor layers. The manufacturing cost issue has hindered adoption of the high efficiency SHJ cell technology. The project's innovation dramatically reduces the cost of the most expensive steps in SHJ cell manufacture while maintaining or improving cell performance. Potentially, the innovation could find application in other markets such as organic light emitting diodes (LEDs). The cost reduction of the SHJ cell will significantly shift the photovoltaic industry's energy conversion efficiency upward and the cost per watt downward.

    The proposed project addresses two shortcomings of the established manufacturing methods for SHJ solar cells. The first challenge is the deposition of the cell's transparent conductive layer, typically an alloy called indium tin oxide (ITO). Standard sputter processes used for this deposition cause damage to the underlying layers of the cell. The damage can reduce the cell performance or require additional process steps. Also, next generation concepts for SHJ cell design are even more sensitive to damage and less able to tolerate "repair" steps. The project will develop a novel low damage sputter source for the ITO deposition. The second challenge is that the semiconductor layers of the SHJ cell use costly plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) systems developed for the high value display industry. The project will direct use of the novel sputter source for deposition of the semiconductor layers as well as the ITO. Sputter is lower cost than PECVD and easily allows sequential layers of different materials to be deposited in a single, continuous flow, in-line machine. The project will demonstrate the sputter source for each of the layers as separate materials and for an SHJ cell with a fully sputtered stack of the three critical layers.

    Research (SBIR) project is to harness the power of engineered gut microbes for

    that respond to gastrointestinal conditions to deliver new therapeutic activities
    to specific sites in the gut at the appropriate dose and time. This SBIR project
    will improve the reliability of these cell-based therapies by allowing for precise

    IBD is a chronic disease with no cure and low response rates to current treatments,
    affecting 1.4 million Americans at an annual cost of $6.3 billion in the US alone.
    In addition to solving a critical remaining challenge in bringing this IBD therapy

    This SBIR Phase I project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. The proposed innovation will advance state-of-the-art by providing a continuous in-situ multi-analyte sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important culture analytes. The sensor array will have the unique ability to measure time dependent correlations between pH, osmolality, and concentrations of glucose, lactate and monoclonal antibodies. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing upstream biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of biologic drug cost of goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed is expected to reduce these costs up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the sensing molecules. Thus, the proposed technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or in medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality.

    This project will demonstrate the feasibility of adapting newly discovered affinity ligands for bioprocess sensing; thereby obtaining the first in-situ biosensor that can be used to monitor the concentration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) during manufacturing in real time. This biosensor will be based on a novel magnetically transduced stimuli-responsive hydrogel containing affinity ligands that target mAbs. This antibody sensor will be integrated into an existing in-situ bioreactor sensor array capable of monitoring other key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing. Product feasibility will be demonstrated via three objectives: 1) Synthesize a novel magnetically transduced stimuli-responsive hydrogel containing affinity ligands that specifically bind to mAbs. 2) Incorporate the hydrogel of objective 1 into a sensor suitable for monitoring the concentration of mAbs in cell culture media in the concentration range relevant to biomanufacturing. 3) Integrate the antibody sensor into an existing sensor array and demonstrate its performance under typical antibody manufacturing conditions. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus the proposed project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of software that automatically
    identifies and labels problems that patients encounter when they receive care.
    \ This information tells health care providers exactly what they need to fix to
    improve patient care.  Applications of the software include: a) the developing
    different software versions for different health care situations, the technology
    can be used to improve the patient experience in clinics, emergency departments,
    primary care settings, outpatient centers, etc.; b) Early interventions.  Healthcare
    leaders are asking for an early warning system.  By recording patient conversations
    with nurses and doctors while they are still in the hospital, this feedback can
    be used to identify and resolve problems before the patient is discharged; c)
    New health care delivery models.  One hospital wants to reduce the length of stay
    for heart patients; doctors want to be sure that patients are ready to go home.
    \ The software is analyzing the stories of heart patients who did well versus
    patients who had problems when they left the hospital early.  Their feedback will
    help keep patients out of the hospital and if they are admitted, improve their
    care before and after they leave; d) Following the doctor's orders.  When chronic
    care patients don't follow through on the treatment plan recommended by their
    doctor, their health problems often get worse.  This software can be used to collect
    feedback from chronically ill patients and identify patterns in why these patients
    are not following doctor's orders solutions that motivate and engage patients
    can be implemented; and e) Other industries.  This software can be used to analyze
    patient feedback during clinical trials.  The resulting information will make
    it easier to recruit and retain patients in clinical trials as well as improve
    clinical outcomes.  Ultimately, results from these analyses could be used to inform
    FDA decision making within the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nThe proposed project
    develops software that uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
    to analyze patients? responses about their health care experiences in interviews
    and open response survey questions in order to provide hospitals with concrete,
    actionable information on how to improve care and patient outcomes. To date, hospitals
    have relied primarily on surveys to inform their attempts to improve patient experiences.\nThis
    research will develop an NLP application for mining patient feedback across health
    care settings. Data where patients freely tell their \"stories\" provides a clearer
    and more precise view of the patient's experience than a standard survey with
    ratings on predefined questions. The challenge is that the variability of expression
    and experiences requires sophisticated techniques to be able to classify the information,
    determine the sentiment, and extract essential details that can provide actionable
    recommendations to hospitals. The team proposes a combination of data annotation,
    pattern matching, and machine learning techniques for classification and information
    extraction of core concepts like problem root causes from unstructured patient
    feedback. Since interviews comprise much of the most informative data, we will
    also evaluate which speech recognition technologies can best convert audio to
    text, for subsequent classification and information extraction."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will not only produce a multifunctional thermal insulation structure that is easy to install onto any existing single-, double-, or even triple-pane windows in reducing total building energy consumption, but also improve water condensation issues and occupant discomfort that are associated with single-pane windows in cool climates. Furthermore, the smart window system includes a soundproof layer that can attenuate noise, outperforming a triple-pane window without deterioration of optical properties. In cold climates, the film, which uses a low-e coating, will prove the exterior temperature condition (< -5 °C) required for interior condensation to occur in winter. The proposed approach outperforms existing doubleor triple-pane windows with Al frames and conventional spacers and will enjoy a share of the already-popular energy saving windows market (61.6%, or ~$10 billion Global). According to our cost estimate for a 1 square foot smart window of the design dimension proposed (including all chemical and energy costs in a scalable roll-to-roll process), a $5/ft2 manufacturing cost can be achieved, providing a great incentive with a pay-off period within 5 years for customers.

    The proposed project will address thermal, optical, and acoustic concerns on an existing singlepane window simultaneously. The thin window film realizes a low U-factor (&#8804; 0.45) within 3mm in thickness, through the combination of a super-low thermal conductive supporting material, and two distinct coatings (low transmittance in infrared region) on a thin film, which can be readily attached to a single-pane glass window. It also yields noise attenuation &#8805; 50 dB with designed cavities embedded in the window film to attenuate noise transmission. The resulting sheet can not only enhance acoustic insulation performance but also reduce the volume of the porous membrane used and thus cost. In addition, the smart film demonstrates all-season operation of smart-glass based on temperature-responsive, tunable Near-IR transmittance in a tunable thermochromic coating without electric power consumption. The film controls haze by Page 11 controlling light scattering in the interface of granulate materials and reduces the volume fraction of the structural material used in the proposed smart film. The combined low-e and thermochromic coatings will help the film achieve a high color rendering index because visible transmittances for the coatings are excellent complements to each other, thus exhibiting a broad and uniform transmission over the visible spectrum.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable flexible carrier aggregation in mobile wireless networks using frequency-translational quadrature-hybrid (FTQH) technology. The customer demand for wireless connectivity keeps increasing both in terms of more connected devices and higher data rates. Carrier aggregation is a critical technology to further increase data rates for next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks. It lets mobile network operators and neutral hosts make more effective use of their fragmented spectral resources. Mobile communications are now an essential part of our personal and professional lives and impact all aspects of our society from business, to government, to education and the non-profit sector. The small business concern will generate OEM RF front-end products for the small-cell base station market which is growing rapidly with more than 10 million small-cell base station shipments estimated in 2020. This will strengthen the US commercial technology base and generate US employment opportunities as it grows its workforce.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the FTQH technology. This technology promises to enable the design of modular, flexible RF front ends for small-cell base stations. FTQH is a novel architectural approach that leverages existing RF filtering, RF switching and RF routing technologies while enabling low cost, high performance, modular RF front ends for flexible carrier aggregation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans various segments i.e. consumer, environment
    monitoring, healthcare, infrastructure monitoring, automotive, smart cities, agriculture, power generation,
    oil and gas, industrial automation/manufacturing, retail, and robotics to name a few. Over the past several
    decades, wireless connectivity has played a significant role in reshaping our social lives and generating
    huge economic value for businesses all around the globe. The wireless connectivity has been focused
    around human-to-human communication but in the next decade machine-to-machine communication will
    play a significant role in the fourth industrial revolution. The proposed R&D will enable the vision of
    ubiquitous connectivity at scale, which the Internet of Things promises. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    economic impact is projected to be anywhere between $7-15 trillion globally in the next decade and the
    impact of it will be felt by virtually every industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the two key problems with the
    current state-of-the-art wireless sensor nodes. First is the limited battery-life and second is the cost of the
    sensor nodes. Low power standard compliant wireless communication plays a key role in extending the
    battery-life of a wireless sensor node. Experience with semiconductors dictates that complete system
    integration on a single piece of silicon (zero external components) not only reduces the cost of the system
    (in high volume) but also improves the systems? overall energy efficiency. This enables operation on
    harvested energy requiring no external battery. No external components imply that the microsystem needs
    to operate from energy sources with limited capacity. No external components also imply no quartz crystal
    frequency reference, which almost every microsystem uses as of today for frequency and timing reference.
    Off-chip crystal is a bulky component that poses a severe size limitation for low-profile millimeter scale
    microsystems. Eliminating off-chip crystal is a significant step forward towards energy autonomous
    millimetre-scale microsystems that have widespread commercial applications.

- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project intends to create a human to machine language tool that allows anything from the simplest shape to the most complex engineering design to be fabricated anywhere that a robotic fabrication machine and the necessary raw materials exist. At a high level many parts are created today customized to a specific users need and a small handful of humans have the knowhow and access to machines to create such customized parts on their own. The complexity of this can be mitigated by creating tools for translation of information from people?s ideas to machine output with much less error and cost. By creating a means to simplify the process of getting from idea to customized fabricated parts, the proposed tool can help achieve balance between creativity and production more easily for Maker Manufacturing. Upon successfully deploying a uniformed solution to the overly complex mesh of fabrication processes used today, hundreds of thousands of new machines can be employed at any end point by interchangeable people to bring to bear goods at any level of precision needed. The end goal is creation of a portal and toolset for fabricators to take and fulfill small batch manufacturing of parts. Success will mean that hundreds to thousands of times more people will be able to create tangible goods from ideas and concept combinations.


    This is a project to unify CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) across all digital fabrication tools and reduce the complexity of machining designs. While 3D printing may bring an idea of simplicity and access to everyone, laser cutting, CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled or Robotic), injection molding, vacuum forming, and other tools of mass production can likewise also be made more accessible. The project is a software tool embodying a single process for which any design can start at one end and any machine be placed at the other end. At least in showing how much of the same end result, if any, each machine is capable of producing of the intended output. This project will produce a part plus material algorithm by which any part that can be fabricated can be proposed to the algorithm and all of the machines capable of producing them can be identified. From there the scale - both in size of part and number - of copies of the part can be added in and thus sort the machines by best part quality, price, and overall speed of production at any volume. The goal of the research is to capture all existing manufacturing practices in machine shops and Maker places, and assure that none of today?s capabilities are lost while creating a living algorithm that allows for future capabilities to be added to any fabrication process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-Level inverter, an integrated 48kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy.  The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault-tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    increase in the efficiency and reliability of the power grid, which would result
    in lower electricity rates to consumers and facilitate the integration of renewable
    energy into the grid. This project will enable the use of topology optimization
    in the operation of the power transmission grid and allow operators to adapt the
    grid configuration to address changes in system conditions in real time. These
    adaptive reconfigurations increase the ability of the system to transfer power
    across the network in the directions that matter for economic, reliability, or
    environmental reasons. The economic benefits of topology optimization represent
    a 50% reduction in the cost of grid congestion, which translates to $1-4 billion/year
    production cost savings in the US. In addition, topology optimization would consistently
    reduce, or entirely remove, the otherwise frequent overloads on transmission facilities,
    thereby increasing the reliability of the grid. Topology optimization would also
    facilitate grid operations with large amounts of variable renewable resources,
    such as wind and solar, by relieving their curtailment by about 40%. Given the
    increase in renewable energy in the generation mix, topology optimization is expected
    to become even more effective and important in the future. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop fast and adaptive power
    system model reduction software fully integrated with topology optimization software.
    The technical challenge arises from the fact that finding a power flow solution
    for a large full nodal model of a power system requires the model to be reduced
    to an equivalent smaller model, to avoid numerical issues with the full model.
    For typical analyses, this reduction only needs to be performed once; however,
    for topology optimization, in the course of finding a good topology configuration,
    hundreds of different topologies need to be analyzed. Thus, the main technical
    hurdle preventing topology optimization from being used in online operations decision-support
    is the current state-of-the-art model reduction computation speed. As such, this
    project?s objective is to lower the computation time of the model reduction component
    by at least 10 times compared to existing capabilities in commercial software,
    when used as part of topology optimization routines. Model reduction calculations
    will be designed to take advantage of problem-specific attributes of the topology
    optimization routine, which will enable reduced computation time, by, for example,
    making use of partial recalculations and decomposition of the problem to support
    parallelization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address the ability to use automation to harvest strawberries in the United States in an environment where migrant labor is scarce and the work is undesirable. The project is borrowing techniques and methods that have been used and refined in many other high volume manufacturing/production industries and applying the applicable ideas to harvesting food crops with automated machines. Big data methods are also being developed in conjunction with the acquisition techniques that will assist crop growing with predictive information about future yields and help with monitoring plant health in relation to disease and pest infestation. The business model being developed helps the adoption of the technology into the farming community by not requiring the farmers to have large capital outlays by providing the anticipated machines to the farmers as a service to replace their labor. The initiation of the service will therefore be an easy decision for a farmer to make and will be helpful in establishing the standard for future harvesting models and techniques.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing techniques and ideas to be able to accomplish the robotic harvesting of some of the most labor intensive and delicate fruit. Special machine vision techniques are being utilized to be able to simultaneously detect, decipher and target the fruit at a speeds conducive to commercial harvesting. Also, unique machine techniques that will enable the harvesting of the fruit without bruising. Objectives include experimenting with ideas that will lead to more consistent fruit packing and techniques to increase fruit shelf life after picking. Most prior research in these areas focused on being able to pick the fruit with machines and not so much on the ability to do it at commercial speeds. The entire purpose of the systems of the Harvest CROO is to rapidly acquire the fruit under the plants and then be able to pack and carry it out of the fields. Many of the projects until this point had no allotment for removing the fruit from the fields. The Harvest CROO system will establish standards for this.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the reduction
    in the cost of renewable energy. The dramatic decline in the cost of wind energy
    over the last several decades has been fueled by the ever increasing turbine size
    and the introduction of new manufacturing methods and materials. However, the
    industry is approaching the limits of this trend due to the increased wear and
    tear of the turbine blades and drive train, caused by unsteady aerodynamic forces.
    Turbine manufacturers have been studying and testing various approaches to mitigate
    unsteady aerodynamic loads, including independent blade pitch control, trailing
    edge flaps, microtabs, boundary layer blowing, and mechanical camber control.
    Each of these potential solutions is costly, complex, and requires moving parts.
    As a result, none has moved beyond the prototype stage. The new active load-control
    system, based on plasma actuators, has the potential to leap-frog all other solutions.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
    the feasibility of countering unsteady aerodynamic forces in utility-scale wind
    turbines by controlling the air flow around the blades with blade-mounted plasma
    actuators. This fully electronic flow control device will mitigate aerodynamic
    loads and enable the deployment of larger, more efficient and more durable turbines.
    Leveraging recent improvement in plasma actuator technology, with a ten-fold increase
    in thrust, and with one-tenth of the power consumption, a new innovative actuator
    will be designed, built and tested with 2-4X performance improvement over the

    unsteady aerodynamic forces in large wind turbines with blade tip speeds of up
    to 200 miles/hour."

    This Phase I project will determine the efficacy of cutting-edge digital technologies for language acquisition by non-native English speakers.  In particular, the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking students learn more effectively when given native-language educational tools will be tested.  As they progress through the study, students will transition from Spanish-only to bilingual or English-only instruction appropriate to their level of attainment, using award-winning digital platforms and learning tools.  Research suggests that technologies that leverage native language ability to calibrate achievement are more effective than English-only instruction.  However, current methods are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. As a consequence, more than 40% of today's non-native speakers drop out of school.  Students who learn English fluently have been shown to excel in all academic areas and, therefore, become fuller participants in American civil society.  If successful, this project will enhance an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use in schools nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation's mission.

    Existing products in educational software offer limited comprehensible input - basic instruction in non-English languages - and typically do not employ best practices for the transference of Spanish language ability to English learning programs.  This project proposes to employ an existing language-acquisition platform, combined with a set of Spanish-language and bilingual language scaffolding tools, to determine the most effective practices for English learning.  Researchers will conduct a six-month pilot project in one or several Southern California public school districts, and success will be measured by the Bateria en Español and Woodcock Language Proficiency Tests. The project will leverage this platform to determine the optimal combination of language tools (sentence frames) and the best timeframe for transitioning instruction from Spanish to English (from Level 1 to Level 2 instruction).  The project will employ best-practice techniques according to the Shelter Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) and the Bilingual Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (BCIRC) standards.  Results will be both qualitative and quantitative, and study results will be assessed using standard measures of statistical significance.  The research team will be headed by a long-time educator and an educational software developer, and both leads are well qualified to conduct research of this type.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to increase access to and compliance with cardiac rehabilitation program and reduce the cost of avoidable hospital readmission, both by predicting which cardiac patients are at risk and by providing patients with simple but accurate guidance, allowing them to precisely control exercise intensity and volume during rehabilitation. It also has the potential to reduce the mortality rates of cardiac patients and provide doctors with a large amount of accurate information on the relationship between exercise duration, exercise intensity, and changes in cardiac patient conditions during recovery, supporting optimal design of rehabilitation program design. The key idea enabling these outcomes is using wearable sensors to measure the mechanical power outputs of cardiac patients and using these power measurements to estimate an established high-quality predictor for cardiac patient hospital readmission and mortality rates. The size of the market is substantial, with roughly one million Americans suffering from heart attacks per year.

    The proposed project will determine whether total body mechanical power output can be used to predict metabolic energy expenditure, using a ground truth based on volume of oxygen consumption per unit time. This metric, VO2 is a heavily used indicator of cardiac health for patients who have experienced heart attacks. Ambulatory mechanical power output has been used by athletes to track and provide feedback on physical condition, but it remains unclear whether similar applications are feasible for cardiac patients, due to their differing physical conditions and sensor use preferences. In addition to validating the use of mechanical power to estimate VO2 the project will also evaluate different sensor use and wearability conditions appropriate for cardiac patients, and make innovations in signal processing algorithm, sensor design, and usability required by these conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to create a user-friendly, universal control
    system for robots and sensors that for the first time would make it possible for nontechnical service
    industry professionals to task and control co-robots deployed in their facility. This simplification of
    software for an end-user will make systems of robots as easy to control as a single robot. Data collected
    over the lifecycle of the robots and sensors (which is currently not done) may aid in identification of new
    technologies to revolutionize system capabilities in the field of robotics. Although this concept could be
    applied to a wide array of service sector industries, SRT proposes to efficiently integrate and
    cooperatively control a fleet of robots and sensors to support custodial service industry tasks, because?
    though essential?custodial services add no commercial value to an organization. Thus the sector is
    clamoring for ways to reduce personnel turnover and other costs. In the U.S., custodial services are a $40
    billion industry; a mere 5% increase in efficiency would result in $2 billion in savings annually. This
    sector is rife with robots from disparate manufacturers, yet facility managers need an easy-to-use method
    to ?employ? multiple, specialized robots.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a common software
    architecture that will serve as a universal receptor for service robotics systems. The predominant technical
    hurdle is effectively combining the software protocols and coordinating control of the robots. There
    currently is no common standard for robotics software systems. The actual robot (the hardware) is
    typically the primary focus for product developers, while the software is built from a variety of
    proprietary, heritage and open sources, and is as unique as the company developing it. Little or no
    consideration is given to how robots from different manufacturers could interact in the real world. By
    standardizing the data protocols for robots and smart devices, and making that openly available, SRT
    intends to drive future open API development for hardware. Standardized APIs will still protect the
    proprietary components, but will quickly allow for data sharing across multiple devices?facilitating
    research in robotics, machine learning, and big data?by allowing end-users to quickly integrate multiple
    components into the same system, and develop their own algorithms to utilize the shared data streams.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to eliminate the need for costly trial and error in the fabrication of specialty optical fibers. Specialty fibers are rapidly finding applications in a diverse array of fields, resulting in a rapidly growing market for this technology. However, a major bottleneck in their development is the difficulty of fabricating them, since the configuration of the fiber may differ from the preform from which it is drawn. The new technology will provide value in significantly reducing costs in materials and labor associated with existing trial and error procedures by providing a tool capable of predicting in advance the preform configuration and parameters necessary to draw a desired fiber. Besides enhancing scientific understanding of the physics of fiber drawing, the development of this tool would allow more rapid exploration of the possibilities offered by specialty optical fibers.

    The proposed project would lay the mathematical groundwork necessary to develop prediction software for specialty optical fibers. By developing a mathematical model of the fluid dynamics of fiber drawing that incorporates both air channels and inclusions of viscous fluid, it would be applicable to a wide range of specialty optical fibers being developed today, including multicore fibers. The proposed project would additionally attempt to overcome previous efforts' restrictions on the slenderness of the draw-down region. Because the model will be specialized to the geometry of fiber drawing, an implementation will run fast enough for fabricators to explore a large space of possible parameters, allowing them to realize their fiber designs precisely. The model will be tested against numerical simulations of viscous threads and against experimental data. A successful outcome of the proposed project will be the development of methods that are accurate, fast enough for optimization work, and require only parameters that can be easily measured in draw towers. Implementing these methods in software will provide a crucial tool for fabricators in this rapidly expanding market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the possibility to revolutionize the treatment of cancer through more sensitive and specific cancer biomarker detection. 1.66 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer in 2014 alone, of which 585,720 died.  The sum of all health care costs in 2011 for cancer in the US was $88.7 billion.  A low cost, less invasive, and more sensitive detector will allow earlier detection of cancer and thus lower the cost of treatment and increase survival rates.  Higher sensitivity cancer detection will lead to early detection, enable targeted treatment, and save money and lives while improving quality of life.  In addition, the knowledge learned from this grant can be applied to other sensors in which the nanowires are functionalized for detection of materials.  These sensors could include sensors to support the Internet of Things, pollution monitoring, and ensuring high water quality.

    The proposed project will advance our knowledge of using nanowires as detectors. Nanowire sensors have a high surface area-to-volume ratio.  Thus their detection limit is dramatically lowered and their sensitivity is increased relative to non-nanostructured sensors.  This improvement is necessary for many biological assays. Others have made nanowire sensors and demonstrated high sensitivity.  However, the fabrication techniques they use to make their sensors are expensive and slow.  Thus, they are only able to get 1-10 nanowires per sensor and manufacturing throughput is low.  This project will use a high-throughput and low-cost process, and that results in millions of nanowires per sensor.  The nanowires will increase the surface area by over a thousand times thus allowing for more sensitive detection.   Instead of using horizontal wires like the competition, the proposed sensor uses arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.  The device design solves the typical challenges of contacting large arrays of nanowires and enables the measurement of both optical and electrical signals simultaneously.  The proposed project will measure a commercially relevant biomarker for lung cancer.  In addition, the investigators will detect two biomarkers on the same chip, thus demonstrating how the technology can be used to test multiple biomarkers on the same chip.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a low-cost satellite network for Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.   The proposed global communications network is orders of magnitude lower cost relative to existing options, and provides coverage at any location on the Earth.   Scientific, shipping, tracking, automotive, agriculture, energy, medical, educational, and other commercial entities will have the ability to return their data from anywhere on the planet to support tracking, safe operations, and optimal and timely decision making.  This innovative network is also expected to enable new market segments due to its unprecedented capability and cost. Further impact with the introduction of very small satellite design for swarm networking includes making space more accessible and promotes the use of smaller spacecraft resources for more complex missions. This enables the development of new products and services for data collection and return for scientific, societal, or commercial benefit.  Educational and research and development projects will also benefit with reduced barriers of entry to test new concepts and business models, making additional professional development opportunities available.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that there are no existing low-cost options for sensing, transmitting, and connecting devices from remote locations with no cell or Wifi coverage.  Existing solutions like Iridium are expensive and not utilized by the majority of markets requiring connectivity.  Swarm Technologies has developed smart, low-mass, low-power, low-cost (<1/10,000 the mass and power, and 1/400th the cost) integrated sensor and data relay platforms.  This creates the unique opportunity to develop low-cost space and ground based communication networks for global sensing, connectivity, and data return.  The long-term goal of this R&D project is to become a unique and true IoT enabler by creating an open access global space telecommunications network capable of relaying data from any space or ground IoT sensor anywhere on the planet. The research objectives of this proposal are to design and test the operational performance of the ground BEEs (the ground-relay nodes), including developing and characterizing the networking, communication, software, energy management systems.  We will utilize design, simulation techniques, and lab and environmental testing in representative environments (e.g. vacuum chamber and high altitude balloons).

    This SBIR Phase I project will provide an interactive learning environment for educational sketching which is critical in many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Sketching is an integral part of education from elementary school arithmetic to high school physics, and is used in professions ranging from medicine to engineering. Sketching is part of spatial visualization training, which has been shown to increase graduation rates, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. Until now, sketching assignments have been done with pencil and paper. This project will bring sketching assignments to touchscreens on tablets and computers. The algorithm developed will provide students with real-time feedback based upon their preliminary attempts, and teachers will be able to see exactly where students are having difficulty. A unique advantage of this approach is that it tracks student persistence and rewards students who stick with a sketching assignment until completed correctly. This is an advantage over most online education that relies on multiple-choice questions, which can only be attempted once. The project will initially focus on spatial visualization training for college engineering students, but ultimately will extend throughout STEM and be adapted for K-12. The increase in retention of students in STEM will aid in meeting the national targets to support economic growth.

    The software developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide feedback similar to an expert teacher. When a student makes an error, personalized hints are generated. By providing incremental help and rewarding students when they try on their own, student persistence is encouraged. The sketching will be performed on touchscreens, and the software will be compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, Chrome, and Linux operating systems. There are significant challenges with grading sketches, especially when compared to multiple-choice questions. If the grading algorithm is too lenient or too strict, students will lose confidence in the software. The grading algorithm will consider the sketched image, the difficulty of the assignment, and will utilize sketching data from early trials for fine-tuning purposes. Personalized assignments that gradually increase in difficulty as needed, as well as interactive 3D graphics and animations will be provided. A teacher interface will be developed that shows each student's progress down to the detail of each sketch attempt. Additionally, a metric will be developed to quantify student persistence based upon reliance on hints in order to identify which students need more individual mentoring. The scope of this project is the development of the grading algorithm, user interface, assignment and tutorial content, and teacher interface.

    with little margin regarding reliability and performance, and the reliability
    issue has been a great challenge. Reliability must be evaluated to estimate its

    Broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is summarized as follows. (1) Social impact: Transportation is the bloodstream of this nation with its level of importance being second to water. This country?s roadways are public use and the PI?s proposed technology is aimed at maintaining a fair and unbiased information infrastructure that satisfies the needs of both automotive and government agencies to fulfill their roles in public use and safety. (2) Commercial impact: The ability for vehicles to identify roadside regulations and guidance will provide several beneficial factors that will help alleviate driver distraction while aiding in additional cognitive awareness and safety. Additionally, wireless capable road signs can provide additional resources than their static counterparts that will make them more attractive and cost effective to their responsible entity/agency. (3) Technical impact: The project pushes the abilities of ultra low powered devices to extend the idea of location services, thus location dependent information is stored at its source producing almost instantaneous availability.

    The proposed project is working on further advancing and refining a small electronic device with wireless capabilities known as a roadside unit to meet the regulations of the United States Sign Council (USSC) motorist reaction distance for visual street cues to facilitate safe vehicle responses. Satisfying this requirement involves a novel communication protocol structured around efficient message transmission at ultra-low operating power to quickly detect and respond to moving vehicles with minimal energy usage. The projects communication protocol is designed to use minimal power while maximizing the amount of data throughput to ensure an operational lifespan of a battery powered device for a minimum of 10 years while achieving significant transmission distance. Because roadside infrastructure is standardized there is an opportunity for advanced data management techniques to simplify data transmission and decoding. The proposed system integrates and enhances the current vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication platform by offering another layer of sophisticated physical object identification. As vehicles take on autonomous responsibilities, they?ll need reliable, accurate, and authenticatable information about their surroundings with enough notice to facilitate safe responses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a disruptive change to the solar energy industry by potentially doubling the efficiency of the best available solar cells while, at the same time, significantly reducing their cost. Renewable energy sources are critical to energy independence and, importantly, to the long-term viability of human society which is faced with the inevitable depletion of hydrocarbon based energy sources, such as oil, gas, and coal.

    The proposed project leverages known technologies that are used in physics research, specifically in high energy physics accelerators, such as those found in Fermi National Accelerator Lab or at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The approach is based on using thermo-ionic emission from metals as the source of electric power, in contrast to existing technologies that only use photo-generated currents from more expensive semiconductors. This shift can provide not only higher efficiency, but also a shorter "return-on-energy" which is defined as the time it takes for the device to produce as much energy as was used in its production. The project goal is to demonstrate this new approach by producing a cell that can produce electricity with high efficiency and be measured and evaluated independently by a standards laboratory to validate its result. From this starting point, device optimization and further development will provide a new competing approach to energy independence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the first technical advancement in the specialty metals industry (manufacturers of titanium and nickel) in more than 4 decades. Specialty metals are ubiquitous in our lives, with applications from aircraft parts to medical implants, yet the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process, the work horse for this industry, has remained relatively unchanged since its development in the 1940?s. By coupling the ability to measure the location of electric arcs used for melting these high value alloys in the VAR, with the ability to steer the arcs, substantial electrical savings can be achieved, decreasing costs to the consumer and increasing reliability of the final products. For example, it is well known that the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the process leads to an estimated 8% yield loss, costing the US industry $1.024B per year in lost revenue through yield loss and electrical inefficiency, contributing to the high price of these products. This project proposes to decrease this loss by 50% by developing an applied feedback control technology capable of optimizing the energy distribution within these systems, providing better quality metals at a cheaper production price.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to prove that real-time control can improve plasma-based industrial processing systems. The innovation uses externally applied magnetic fields to manipulate arc position modes during melting operations. By coupling arc position sensing, which measures magnetic field vectors exterior to the process to determine arc positions interior to it, with active manipulation of externally derived fields, arcs can be precisely controlled. Relying upon years of development and validation of arc position sensing, coupled with Finite Element Analysis simulations and experimental validation, this technology will become the first active control of arc melting systems. The significant realization is that spatial and temporal control of the diffuse current paths can be controlled precisely if the validated measurement system of current location is coupled with external field generators. This effort will focus on the application to VAR furnaces but may have significant application to other processes with diffuse current pathways such as Joule heated systems, fuel cells, additive manufacturing or industrial microwave processing. The expected impact of arc control during melting is a reduction in manufacturing defects, an enablement of the production of ingots with increasing diameter, a reduction in energy required in alloy production, and improved safety of operations.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a Virtual Reality (VR)-based multiplayer game in which high school-aged players must collaboratively think through and solve complex, authentic Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM)-based problems. The United States faces a shortage of degreed STEM workers. More than half of high school students have indicated that they aren't pursuing STEM degrees or careers because they feel unprepared for or unaware of the opportunities available to them. Further, many students indicate they're interested in science and crave engaging, real-world experiences, but feel that they have limited authentic STEM opportunities in school. There is a need for experiences that engage students in authentic collaborative STEM thinking, and this project seeks to provide them with a compelling virtual problem space using VR. This project also seeks to provide educators with an accessible technology pathway to bring premium VR hardware into schools. Though VR has been heralded as a transformative technology, it currently faces expense and scalability hurdles for in-school use. By leveraging a mixture of technologies and role-based multiplayer, this project will create the virtual context to help players see problems as solvable through reason, experimentation, and collaboration - the heart of STEM philosophy. Players will work together, sharing their knowledge and expertise, running experiments, and solving difficult, compelling science problems.


    The core technical innovation of this project is the design and deployment methodology that will make premium Virtual Reality (VR) experiences a practical tool for schools. The project will result in a multiplayer experience in which one player uses the VR headset to act as the field agent, supported by 5-25 other students using traditional devices with role-based interfaces to act as mission control. By developing asymmetrical (but equally compelling) play experiences, the project will engage all students in collaborative Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) problem-solving. There are three main problems that this project must solve for educators: the hardware problem (VR hardware is expensive, difficult to scale to more than one student at a time, and requires installation and maintenance); the ambitious pedagogy problem (providing hands-on discovery and inquiry experiences that allow for meaningful collaboration and problem-solving); and the embodiment problem (students need to feel personally invested in the problems we devise if the experience is to be meaningful and transformational). The research goals are 1) To determine whether STEM-based scenarios can be generated with sufficient depth to engage a group of high school-age students in collaborative, interdisciplinary thought and problem-solving across both field agent and mission control roles; and 2) To determine whether the multiplayer role-play experiences produce significant improvements in STEM content knowledge and disposition among players. In order to measure these goals, multiple usability and feasibility tests will be conducted in authentic formal educational environments. Each test will be accompanied by a pre- and post-test that measures both content knowledge and disposition.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to provide
    an affordable sealant for sealing expansion joints and cracks in concrete pavement,
    bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, expansion joints are intentionally
    constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear
    thermal expansion when temperature rises. In addition, cracks are a common failure
    mode in pavement. If they are not properly sealed, water penetration will damage
    the surface layer and the layers beneath, and entrapped debris will cause rupture
    of the concrete wall. Therefore, sealing cracks and joints is a common practice
    to maintain or extend the structure service life. Various types of sealants have
    been used with an annual market value about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many
    sealants cannot properly seal cracks and joints, and/or last long, requiring frequent
    replacement or resealing. In this project, a smart sealant that expands upon cooling
    and contracts upon heating, which is thermally opposite to concrete, will be developed
    to counteract thermal movement of the joined structural elements. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project lies in the feasibility of a smart sealant technology. The
    primary reason for joint failure is that most sealants behave similar to concrete,
    i.e., they contract upon cooling and expand upon heating. This thermal behavior
    is contrary to the requirement for sealants. The objective of this project is
    to design, synthesize, characterize, and evaluate a cost-effective two-way shape
    memory polymer based sealant for sealing expansion joints or cracks in concrete
    pavement or bridge deck, which will expand upon cooling and contract upon heating.
    It will have the required mechanical properties and durability to survive the
    repeated traffic load and outdoor environment. The success of the project can
    have beneficial impact not only on the transportation infrastructure but also
    other structures such as driveways, parking lots, dams, harbors, buildings, swimming

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its provision of a novel ranging capability whose quality, ease of placement, and scale in deployment will introduce new opportunities in robot operation in situations where there is uncertainty in the relative positions of parts and robots. These include small-batch production (where fixturing cannot be made cost effective), inspection and repair in confined spaces (where 3D sensing must be carried aboard the actuator), hazardous situations (where human presence incurs risk to life), and collaborative interaction with people (where inadvertent contact must be avoided). In the proposed development, robot grasp will be empowered with dynamic 3D range mapping at each fingertip, enabling direct computation of trajectories and velocities tailored to the geometry and structure about to be manipulated.  Extension of the technology to the larger challenge of 3D vision and object modeling offers economic impact in diverse applications.  These include autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle navigation (drones, cars), virtual reality and augmented reality interfaces, 3D teleconferencing and communication, cultural site modeling, and immersive cinema.  Each is an area where increases in reliability and precision with decreases in power and computational cost can bring an application over the threshold in price/performance, into viability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish a new level of real-time passive visual perception in near-range for robot operation, providing 3D data for accurate, precise and rapid grasp. Binocular imaging systems have not demonstrated success in near range robotics due to the inability of their match-based methods to deliver reliable depth measures in complex settings where disparity range is large. Current methods using a few cameras are based on matching so make mistakes, use search that is exponential in covered range so are expensive, and deliver parsimonious descriptions of the world (point clouds) so are weak in descriptive power.  All of these diminish the reliability of their processing and the utility of their analysis in real-world applications.  The technology of this project combined with recent wafer-level integration module packages overcomes these limitations through use of dense sampling, extended baselines, and maintaining and exploiting image spatial continuity. The technical challenge involves mechanical and electrical design to enable micro light-field ranging with analysis on an embedded processor, near-field calibration of imagers/optics/system, and coordination of these with robot control for assessing measurement accuracy and precision. The project will result in high-quality frame-rate light-field ranging on a robot fingertip.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide patients with a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device for the alleviation of postoperative ileus (POI) and the restoration of gastrointestinal motility. POI is an impairment of gastrointestinal motility that often develops following abdominal surgery and causes significant discomfort and comorbidities to both patients and their families. Existing solutions in the prevention or treatment of POI based on management strategies and pharmaceutical therapies have limited efficacy and are highly anecdotal. There is also no effective way for clinicians to quantitatively monitor the severity and resolution of POI.  The project is valuable and timely, and it represents a significant departure from the status quo. The success of this project would not only benefit the patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce the health care expenditure in the United States by shortening the hospitalization stay as well as the associated medical resources. The developed technologies can be further served as research tools for various biomedical applications to investigate underlying biological mechanisms and the feasibility study of novel treatment method for different diseases.

    The proposed project is to develop and demonstrate a wireless extra-luminal closed-loop gastrointestinal modulation device, capable of simultaneously neuromodulating the gastrointestinal tract and recording gastrointestinal motility wirelessly for alleviating POI, resulting in enhancing gastrointestinal motility.  POI costs over US $1.5 billion annually to its healthcare system. Safely shortening this length of stay by one day would produce significant dividends, leading to a market size of more than $700 million annually. The proposed project will address not only the design and optimization of a bioelectronic device, but also the integration and miniaturization of the wireless gastrointestinal therapeutic device. Animal study is to be conducted to validate the efficacy of the device in modulating and wirelessly recording of gastrointestinal motility, and its safety and reliability. If successful, the outcome will lead to a new bioelectronics medicine that advances the treatment of POI, and can be potentially expanded to other medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be observed through a direct reduction in the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings, campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will be significantly improved with the installation of PRC roofing material for building energy management. A complementary function of PRC roofing is found with the potential for enhanced condensation from the ultra-cool surface, presenting the ability to integrate PRC for improved rooftop water harvesting, directly impacting critical water supply issues and the expensive effects of drought on regional agriculture. The market demand for cool roofing materials has exceeded $750M, annually, and is expected to grow with recent energy regulations. PRC roofing material can expect to compete in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal management to facilities dedicated to condensation of atmospheric water vapor in isolated regions without access to satisfactory water supplies, and portable use for emergency water harvesting.

    The proposed project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage?relative to current commercial cool roofing materials?is expected to create significant long-term cost-savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled structures. PRC material properties designed to be selective across the ultraviolet-visible-infrared spectrum offer the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of visible and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly in the 8-13 ìm atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, prototype fabrication, and large batch manufacturing economy. The second primary objective is sub-scale fabrication and spectral characterization of the PRC roofing material. Subsequent demonstration of a functional PRC sample with quantified passive cooling power is key to the goals of attracting licensing clients and/or investments for commercial-grade manufacturing.

- abstractText: "This Phase I project will test and optimize a software system and
    digital tools designed to promote parent/caregiver-mediated dialogic reading routines
    in children ages 6 months to 5 years. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been
    shown to foster virtually all school-readiness indicators from cognitive and social-emotional
    development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. Research demonstrates
    that science learning should also be cultivated before kindergarten entry, so
    children begin formal schooling with age-appropriate content and conceptual knowledge
    and the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The increase of income
    inequality in the US underscores the urgency of closing ever-widening achievement
    gaps between children living in poverty and more affluent peers. Investments in
    early childhood have been shown to remediate educational deficits, so a cost-effective,
    home-based method of guiding parents and caregivers in a dialogic reading process
    can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps, the precursor
    to persistent achievement gaps, and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages
    they perpetuate. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and
    growing. Purchasers in this market include institutions (e.g., preschools, Head
    Start, social-service agencies, libraries), community initiatives, healthcare
    professionals working with families of young children, as well as individual families.\n
    \nThis project will build a complex technology systems architecture to sell, distribute,
    manage, and evaluate educative materials on commonly available digital devices
    of all form factors. The product uses a proprietary system to build hybrid reading
    selections with separate visible layers targeted for the two audiences - children
    and the adults reading to them. This approach engages both audiences, while providing
    actionable and effective guidance for caregivers for whom dialogic reading may
    be a new or not yet habitual practice. Along with layered selections, a key innovation
    employed by this project will be a set of proprietary algorithms that learns from
    user behavior and tailors the program to the needs of each individual. To further
    increase efficacy, this project will include a secure data-sharing portal to allow
    institutional clients to evaluate school readiness among their constituencies
    and to manage their programs accordingly. A robust content management system will
    support a variety of sales options and allow for dynamic updates and additions
    to the system content. Finally, an engagement system based on behavioral psychology
    will be developed to promote application stickiness aimed at building routines
    of reading and dialogic thinking."

    collaborative authoring tool to achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in technical
    skills required to author technology-enhanced assessments (TEAs). Additionally,
    it will seek to advance the frontiers of TEA authoring beyond individual assessments
    to encompass the creation of personalized TEA pathways for diverse learners. The
    effort will explore novel technologies including a symbolic abstraction to enable
    visual design and implementation of complex programming constructs, and the representation
    of TEAs as \"intelligent objects\" interoperable with disparate and proprietary
    assessment platforms. This effort seeks to break the stranglehold of large organizations
    on a growing assessments market that marginalizes educators due to barriers of
    cost and technology skills. It will empower educators by making available easy-to-use
    tools that enable creation and sharing of open TEAs and TEA pathways to support
    deeper learning at scale, allowing educators to distribute TEAs in a classroom
    without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system, triggering the evolution
    of a peer-to-peer marketplace for teacher-created assessments. This disruption
    bears the potential to empower educator communities at scale and impact all learners
    in secondary and tertiary education settings through equitable access to quality
    assessments. \n\nThis project will feature two distinctive innovations. The first
    is a visual programming environment with symbolic abstraction of complex programming
    constructs that are imperative for the design and creation of TEAs. This will
    enable intuitive authoring of complex TEAs by non-programmers (an impossibility
    today) and break down the biggest friction point for achieving access to TEAs
    at scale. The second is an open format for representation of TEAs as intelligent
    objects that are platform agnostic and \"embeddable\" in any assessment delivery
    system. This will facilitate distribution and usage of TEAs in browsers and thin
    client environments without the need for server side functionality mandated by
    proprietary systems. This will eventually break the stranglehold of proprietary
    assessment delivery systems that tie TEA access to their platforms. The project
    will pursue two primary research questions: How efficient and useful is the TEA
    authoring experience for non-technical educators? Are the TEAs effective in eliciting
    targeted reasoning and thinking processes? These research questions will help
    validate the technical feasibility of our innovative use of the proposed tool
    to enable easy TEA creation and distribution, and the efficacy of the complex
    TEAs created using the proposed project in providing evidence of target learning."

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to develop an automated and cost-effective method of producing complex carbon fiber parts with a 3D printing process that manages to achieve the full performance of traditional carbon fiber parts while allowing greater use of carbon fiber in applications where machined aluminum was previously the only option. This project involves first testing basic mechanical properties and adjusting processing parameters, and then looking towards using the 5-axis capabilities of the machine to place carbon fibers in multiple directions, allowing for complex parts that need strength in all directions. This novel manufacturing method for carbon fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic parts will greatly expand the markets that can benefit from increased use of carbon fiber materials, including aerospace, high-performance automotive, and custom biomedical parts. By lowering barriers to high performance part development, this technology will also allow smaller companies to fabricate high performance products and create a variety of technical and non-technical jobs within small businesses.


    This project seeks to prove the feasibility of producing high performance carbon fiber parts with a 3D printing process. A 5-axis machine and nozzle has been designed for use with continuous carbon fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastics that will be able to produce complex parts that are able to take complex, multi-axial loads. The primary focus of this project is to generate laminates with comparable properties to traditional continuous carbon fiber manufacturing processes, which would indicate the viability of using this process for high performance parts in aerospace applications, which no composite 3D printing has yet to achieve. After demonstrating the capability of forming high performance laminates, this project will begin focusing on the generating representative parts with reinforcing layers printing in the z-axis. Prior to printing multi-axial parts, this project will focus on achieving novel layered composite structures including variable stiffness laminates and integrated honeycomb cores. The combination of high mechanical properties at a laminate level, tailorability of properties through precise fiber orientation, and the ability to effectively transfer loads to fibers in any direction, will signify a new frontier in the technology and markets for carbon fiber reinforced polymers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes reliable and consistent fluid resuscitation (i.e., intravenous administration of fluids) for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring fluid management. The goal of fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients is to restore blood volume in the circulatory system to an acceptable level in order to ensure adequate tissue perfusion (i.e., blood delivery to tissue). However, large intrapatient and interpatient variability in physiological parameters as well as the effect of different illnesses and medications can result in under- and over-resuscitation of ICU patients by the clinical staff. Optimal fluid resuscitation is especially critical for the recovery of patients with severe sepsis (i.e., patients with sepsis and acute organ dysfunction) or septic shock (i.e., patients with sepsis and persistent or refractory hypotension or tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation). In these patients, ineffective arterial circulation due to vasodilation (i.e., dilation of blood vessels) and capillary leakage (i.e., increased distribution of fluids into the interstitial space) needs to be compensated by fluid management.

    The proposed project involves developing a clinical decision support system for fluid resuscitation for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU. Specifically, a cloud-based clinical decision support system will be developed, which will use continuous measurements from hemodynamic monitoring devices to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid management. In this project, a clinical decision support algorithm that will guide the clinician in fluid management will be developed and a clinical study at our partner hospital will be performed. A critical drawback with using a model-based approach to compute the patient's fluid requirement is that accurate parameter values are needed for the model. However, high-fidelity models do not exist and current models cannot fully account for the physiology and response of the patient to fluids. The proposed framework does not need any patient-specific information (e.g., age, gender, weight, diagnosis, concomitant medication, etc.). Furthermore, the framework does not require an accurate model of the patient dynamics and the patient specific physiological parameters.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive
    sensing elements which provide precise temperature readings to positively impact
    the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research
    is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage
    to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important
    and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected
    ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing
    (pressure).  Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is
    a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care.  Delays in medical intervention
    further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden
    associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly,
    the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates
    from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention

    patient experiences damaging activity such as walking or standing, alerting the
    patient to impending tissue injury. The sensor can also reside daily in a patient?s

    This SBIR Phase I project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering the barriers to innovation.


    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called functional lithography - it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to discover and develop new materials using functional lithography, to push the limits of the materials that are available in additive manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will pave the way for new types of social network analysis to detect anomalies, which could lead to more accurate and faster identification of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA), key opinion leaders (i.e., influentials), and market segments.  Medicare and other healthcare providers lose hundreds of millions of dollars to FWA.  This research proposes using a novel way to discover and combine relationships between entities (e.g., doctors) with information about the entities (e.g., prescription history) using machine learning.  The goal is to reduce a claims investigator's workload while maintaining high accuracy in detecting FWA.  In short, the results of this research will not only improve FWA detection efficiency, but enable detecting new types of FWA.  Societal impact includes reduced costs to the taxpayer for government supported programs such as Medicare through better FWA detection. More broadly, the system could be used to find terrorist and crime networks, detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under-medication, over-medication, and even incorrect medications.

    The proposed project will apply a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities such as doctors with information about doctors (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by developing a new way to automatically discover those relations and then combining those relations with the information about doctors through machine learning, thus vastly improving prediction accuracy. The method uses relation information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa. It is believed that this method will hugely improve the ability to detect FWA. The goal is to achieve a 50% true positive rate in a database of fraud-convicted doctors published monthly by the government.  The scope of the project involves analyzing several different types of health insurance claims formats (e.g., Medicare) and producing a fraud score, which then others can use. The anticipated results include a fraud score for most doctors in the U.S. (at least those who deal with Medicare), APIs to these scores, and an interactive visual system that claims investigators can use to reduce their workload while accurately identifying FWA.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project enables the research and development of
    a new hybrid fixed-fluidized biomass gasifier design that allows for a higher
    carbon conversion efficiency over a far wider range of feedstocks than what current
    commercially available biomass-to-electricity technologies are able to offer.
    This technological development serves the public interest by increasing the economic
    viability of renewable waste-to-energy projects. Biomass waste accumulation from
    forest thinning and agriculture generate approximately 166 million tons of biomass
    each year in the United States alone and is problematic to dispose of due to air
    quality regulations, which restrict open burning, and tipping fees from waste
    sites that have to mitigate methane production from decomposition. Instead of
    open burning or uncontrolled decomposition, biomass gasification enables these
    resources to be utilized locally to replace fossil fuels and to sequester carbon
    to mitigate climate change. Biomass energy is currently limited by feedstock requirements
    (typically restricted to standardized wood pellets), which has constrained the
    implementation of biomass-to-energy plants in the U.S. This project seeks to greatly
    expand the feedstock characteristic options available for biomass energy to offer
    an off-the-shelf commercial solution to sustainable energy project developers
    in the U.S. and organizations responsible for biomass waste processing. Approximately
    150 jobs are expected to be generated in the US to support these two industries,
    through manufacturing and project development, as well as associated sales and
    income tax revenue. \n\nCommercially available downdraft and fluidized bed biomass
    gasifiers are hindered by three main root technical problems that significantly
    constrain the economic viability of state-of-the-art biomass-to-electricity projects:
    1) each is limited by the small range of feedstock particle sizes it can process;
    2) maximum allowable reaction temperatures are limited due to ash fusibility temperatures;
    and 3) the ash fusibility temperature is too low to maximize tar cracking. The
    proposed technical solution separates the vaporized tar and small feedstock particle
    sizes from the larger particles and high ash solid charcoal.  This separation
    decouples the temperature requirements and allows for greater tar cracking potential
    at higher temperatures while maintaining a lower oxidation temperature for the
    char to increase carbon conversion efficiency??overcoming all three root technical
    problems. The goal of the research is to identify and validate the dimensions
    and parameters required to maintain stable biomass gasification with improved
    tar cracking efficiency and reduced ash clinkering risk. The scope of the project
    includes proving the proposed technology at a gas capacity of 20kW, which will
    be scaled up to a 150kW to be able to provide the algorithm to dimension the technology
    at any scale. The development of a fully fuel agnostic gasifier is the so-called
    holy grail of gasification and the successful completion of the project will be
    a significant step toward this goal, enabling the technology to scale successfully
    and be disseminated in almost any market or sector with a biomass waste stream."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that due to the increased mobility of human beings and the nature of modern economic and social activities a variety of power challenges need to be addressed for portable electronic and mechanical devices. The needs include quick power delivery, light-weight but high-capacity energy storage, superior low-temperature operation and ability to handle millions of cycles. On average a soldier, a construction worker or an everyday handyman carry between 50 to 100lb of weight while they are working in their duty sites. A significant portion of this load is from the primary and backup batteries used for their tools and equipment, because corded delivery of power is not always possible. Computing, communication, biomedical and avionic industries are also constantly searching for light-weight but highly efficient energy storage gadgets. The ability to integrate graphene and carbon nanostructure based microsupercapacitors in the next generation energy delivery/storage solutions for portable devices and tools will open the doors for new education, research, product development and economic growth. Due to ultra-light-weight, transparency, extremely high thermal stability and tensile strength, and superior electrical conductivity graphene based supercapacitor would also be suitable for flexible, printable, transparent and wearable electronics.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project plans to develop a non-Faradic, thin-film and electrochemical microsupercapacitor utilizing graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT) with high gravimetric energy density. The proposed microsupercapacitor would combine high energy storage capacity of batteries with high power delivery capability of regular capacitors. It would be compatible to commercial lithographic techniques and printable circuit technologies. A limiting factor in the miniaturization of the existing carbon-based supercapacitors is a relatively low volumetric energy density (VED) due to the poor packing density of structures like tangled CNTs. The VED of CNT-based supercapacitors is many orders of magnitude lower than the mainstream energy storage devices. The opportunity to miniaturize the supercapacitor exists with novel designs that strive to minimize its intrinsic components like electrodes and separators that do not directly contribute to cell energy storage. The proposed design would primarily use graphene nanoribbon (GNR) as electrode, which will not have the tangling issue of CNT. Due to the 2D flat nature of GNR the scaling and packing density of GNR devices would be extremely high. The long-term goal is to achieve an energy density over 100 Wh/kg using an array of the proposed microsupercapacitors.

    merit of this project is to utilize and greatly expand upon the findings of impact
    bonding dissimilar metals from previous bodies of work to advance the scientific
    understanding of how ceramics impact bond to metals and how these bonded joints
    survive or potentially degrade when undergoing intense impact fatigue cycle testing.
    Although fatigue cycle testing on metal/ceramic interfaces has been documented
    when the joint is formed through other methods, the PI and team seek to perform
    fatigue cycle testing when metal/ceramic interfaces are optimized for strength
    and durability by the use of near net-shaped impact bonding. Previous methods
    of attaching ceramics to metals have been limited to brazing and adhesives, each
    of which is limited by temperature and strength. Other mechanical methods of joining
    ceramics and metals will simply not hold up during impact fatigue cycling due
    to the different compression properties of the joined materials. This project
    aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals
    and will also further enhance the knowledge of high velocity impact bonding systems.
    Of particular interest is the impact bonding of ceramics/composites such as tungsten
    carbide to hardened steel because of immediate industrial applications."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to bring the industrial advanced manufacturing method of abrasive waterjet cutting to individual consumers by fully redesigning the core components of the machine to meet the budgetary needs of a consumer.  This project parallels the current movement of scaling down advance manufacturing techniques such as laser cutting and 3D printing to the growing desktop fabrication market.  Unfortunately, the desktop digital fabrication tools currently available to consumer market are restricted to producing goods in only soft materials like plastics, and wood.  The biggest advantage of abrasive waterjet cutting is its cutting ability in a wide range of materials including plastics, metals, stone, ceramics, glass, and composites.  With this technology finally accessible to a wider audience, everyone from the middle school robotocist, to a creative entrepreneur, to the makerspaces, to artisans, to small businesses will be able to digitally create physical designs in the full gambit of sheet materials that are currently available.


    Current commercial waterjet designs operate in a high pressure region that makes components prohibitively expensive for the consumer market.  To make the technology viable for the masses it must be adapted to a lower pressure space to leverage the necessary component cost savings across the machine.  This starts by creating a new performance model for low-pressure abrasive waterjet cutting through the design and execution of a test matrix that will determine how cutting performance is affected by various waterjet parameters (water pressure, water flow rate, abrasive flow rate, etc.).  With this understanding, the heart of the system, the hydraulic pump, will be adapted and customized from a pump construction that is not currently used for waterjet cutting. Lastly, this effort concludes with a ground-up redesign of the waterjet?s Cutting Head (the assembly that ejects the high velocity mixture of water and abrasive) utilizing low-cost materials, manufacturing processes and a unique geometry optimized for low-pressure cutting.

    Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to drive safer and more cost-effective emergency
    department care pathways by improved risk stratification at patient presentation
    (triage) compared to the current standards of care. E-triage addresses the ED
    crowding crisis (136 million visits in US annually) that adversely affects patients'
    health outcomes and has led to a state of financial unsustainability in America's
    safety net.  E-triage's approach supports new ED operational models to separate
    service streams for acutely ill and non-urgent patients.  New streaming models
    are needed to mitigate ED crowding by: (1) conserving scarce ED resources for
    patients truly in need of emergency care, and (2) preventing unnecessary waiting
    and costly resource over-utilization for non-urgent patients.  It does this by
    using local ED electronic health record (EHR) data to scientifically risk-stratify
    patients based on risk of critical events and severity of illness.  E-triage meets
    a commercial opportunity to mitigate crowding, enhance ED operational performance,
    and improve the value of healthcare delivered to ED patients.  The proposed project
    will transition E-triage to a scalable and commercially available platform under
    a business model that supports growth.  \n\nThe proposed project will yield a

    being piloted in multiple emergency departments (EDs).  E-triage deploys a novel
    combination of data-science methods and flexible information technology architecture
    that supports usability by diverse ED customers. The tool relies on advancements
    in machine learning methods, mechanisms to harness user feedback, and software
    technology that is flexible and interoperable with EHR systems.  It must also
    securely transmit and store patient data and be computationally efficient to accommodate
    fast-paced ED environments.  E-triage enables rapid data-driven prognostication
    of ED patients at presentation based on risk of critical events and severity of
    illness using common locally collected ED data.  Compared to US triage practice
    standards, which relies heavily on provider subjective judgment, e-triage demonstrates
    improved identification of high- and low-risk patients based on evidence from
    retrospective and prospective evaluation.  E-triage is disruptive in its design
    to support new ED operational models that separate service streams for acutely
    ill and non-urgent patients toward reducing the burden of ED crowding."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the massive unmet need of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which affects over 12 million Americans and results in over 65,000 amputations each year. This project will provide the proof of concept for a novel drug delivery technique that will improve the durability of procedures to restore blood flow in PAD patients. The result technology will help reduce the burden of disease while reducing the significant societal and health system costs caused by amputations.

    The proposed project will address the challenge of providing controlled drug dose to arteries of varying diameter and length. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients have atherosclerotic lesions that are long and diffuse, requiring treatment to multiple sites with different vessel diameters and lengths. Existing drug delivery platforms require the use of multiple, expensive devices to treat these patients. This project will demonstrate that a single ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery catheter can provide drug delivery to different artery diameters and lengths, providing significant potential cost and time savings during endovascular procedures. In order apply the desired drug dose to arteries of varying size, real time imaging feedback will be used to adjust the treatment settings to compensate for changes in size. To achieve this goal, ex vivo swine arteries of different sizes will be treated under physiological flow conditions while varying the treatment parameters in order to determine the effect of vessel size on delivered drug dose. From this project, algorithms that can control drug dose to match varying artery diameter will be developed for future in vivo animal model studies.

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a novel stimulation active paddle electrode technology.
    \ Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuromodulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology will double the therapeutic surface
    area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology will improve low-back pain relief,
    as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event of electrode
    movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project seeks
    to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit, by
    developing an active stimulation-grid electrode technology.  By positioning a
    tiny electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, we can create a 48 or 96
    channel stimulation grid which can be programmed to deliver precision therapy.
    \  To accomplish these goals, we will perform three critical tasks including:
    \ (1) design of the paddle electrode using electric field simulations to current-steer
    therapy to low-back pain fibers, (2) develop a prototype of the active stimulation
    grid lead using a tiny ceramic hermetic package and micro-circuit, and (3) validation
    of the recruitment of low-back pain fibers in the spinal cord.  The goal of the
    project is to develop proof-of-concept data to show that active-lead technology
    can improve delivery of therapy to low-back pain fibers.  Validation will be performed
    by recording the evoked potentials across the surface of all dorsal columns while
    stimulation is selectively applied to lateral electrodes caudal to the recording
    electrodes.  Electromyography control electrodes will be positioned within adjacent
    muscles to verify that dorsal roots are not activated."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve people's lives by creating the first wrist-based device that can reliably assess sleep quality. A large pool of undiagnosed patients and the growing population of the elderly point to a massive end-user market for sleep disorder diagnostics devices. The market is steadily increasing due to the visible tilt in preference from drugs to home care sleep tests that are more convenient and lack side effects. This trend is also due to improvements in consumer based sensor technology, limited number of technicians or specialized physicians, and long wait times. In accordance with these market needs, this project is designed to develop a system for assessing sleep at home in a patient friendly and easy to environment. This technology is expected to be especially attractive to elderly patients looking for alternatives to medications and traditional sleep disorder tests. Because the algorithm developed in this project will be tested and validated in a sleep laboratory, it will be accepted in both clinical and non-clinical setting.

    The proposed project is a research and development effort to create and test a new system for detecting sleep stages. Because poor sleep is common in modern society and has considerable consequences, including decreased work productivity/abilities, increased rate of accidents and traffic fatalities, and increased health care costs, there is a great need for a new system that can provide an ambulatory assessment of sleep quality under real-world conditions. Although there are many wrist-based devices on the market that are well-suited for measuring sleep in both home and clinical settings, none of these devices can currently allow reliable assessment of sleep quality. This project will develop a new algorithm for a wrist-based device that will detect sleep quality based on actigraphy, photoplethysomnography, and physiological responses to sensory stimulation. This research will apply a multi-modal approach to assess quality of sleep and advance the science of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is that it will benefit healthcare by improving patient outcome and procedural efficiency. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to guide interventions, this is challenged by the limited access to the patient inside the scanners. Current practices - either removing the patient and manually inserting the tools or moving the patient to another modality - lengthen the procedures, reduce accuracy, and increase possible trauma. The proposed novel robotic and MRI technologies will address those limitations, enabling performing procedures with the patient inside the MRI scanner. Thus continuous MRI images can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions offering more accurate lesion targeting, shorter procedure times, reduced patient trauma, faster recovery, lower cost, and improved patient outcome. This would transform interventional medicine by improving diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with high impact to patients, their families, and society. With faster patient recovery, this technology will reduce the overall cost of healthcare and enable faster return of patients to the workforce. The novel robotic technologies will generate new positions in R&D and production in medical industries, as well as economic benefits from employing highly skilled personnel.

    The proposed project will develop novel technologies at the intersection of robotics and imaging. The solid-media transmission (SMT) mechanism offers the flexibility of fluidic lines but in a system that is leak-free and less complex and has a more compact power take-off arrangement. The SMT mechanism enables the development of an MRI-compatible manipulator that is adaptable and scalable for use in a wide range of medical interventions, carrying and maneuvering virtually any tool. The proposed research will elucidate the effect of geometric and material parameters on the operation of the SMT mechanism. A prototype SMT-actuated manipulator will be used to demonstrate the functionality of this technology in real-time MRI-guided procedures in-situ and disseminate it with on-site and hands-on demonstrations to clinical venues. Beyond the merit in medical applications, this research enhances scientific and technological understanding by demonstrating an alternative mechanism of remote actuation or local distribution of actuation within a manipulator, which creates the potential to generate novel mechatronic assemblies with applications in automation, oil/gas industries, and aerospace.

    in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving
    fuel economy by incorporation of light metals, especially magnesium, does not
    save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional
    methods. The most energy efficient production method known is a process technology
    that was commercially viable during the 2nd World War but not at any other time
    in history. The project innovation is based on reinvestigation and reinvention
    of this dated process, discovering and addressing the reasons for technical and
    economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using the proposed state-of-the-art
    energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream
    manufacturing methods that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer
    products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium production, and canned
    beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long
    term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium
    metal over the past 100 years and expected continuance of this rate of adoption.\n
    \n\nProduction of magnesium using carbothermic chemistry can be realized at temperatures
    below 1250 degree C using a combination of three operational parameters: 1) reduced
    pressure atmosphere, 2) addition of a catalytic material, and 3) extensive size
    reduction of the reactant materials. In conjunction with a continuous condensation
    and collection system, magnesium produced from this process entails at least a
    50% reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the
    predominant Pidgeon process. The project will employ a variety of high temperature
    experimental systems and methods to investigate performance of pelletized reactant
    materials and obtain recovered metal yields above 85%. An optimized composition
    will be statistically determined and used in a low-temperature prototype reactor
    system for continuous production of crude magnesium. The goal of the project is
    to produce a casted magnesium product and prove the reduction of energy intensity
    and economic feasibility with a techno-economic analysis."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require recovery care to get fully well after being discharged from the hospital. Transitions of care from acute (hospital) to post-acute (short-term rehabilitation and skilled nursing) settings impact millions of Americans every year. Seniors overindex on utilization of post-acute care, as a consequence of natural age-related degeneration and the need for longer recovery periods. By improving post-hospital coordination of care across the continuum, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction stand to improve for America?s aging population. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon methods for user-centered data capture in healthcare. Our proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as electronic health records and claims data from both acute and post-acute care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a highly sensitive, accurate, disposable,
    and affordable point-of-care diagnostic for detecting protein biomarkers. The
    transformational aspects of the technology are in enabling health care workers,
    or even consumers directly, to receive diagnoses in less than 10 minutes with
    an inexpensive, simple to operate diagnostic test that operate similar to over
    the counter pregnancy tests. We are focusing on the diagnosis of Chlamydia Trachomitis
    (CT). There is not point-of-care test available for CT which infects more than
    300 million people each year. CT is asymptomatic and can have long term repercussions
    including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection that can damage the
    uterus, cervix, and ovaries, potentially causing women to become infertile. For
    this reason, the Center for Diseases Control recommends all women younger than
    25 receive yearly screening. Once demonstrated, the LID technology will be broadly
    applied to other illnesses and indications that would also benefit from immediate
    diagnoses. \n\nThe proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing
    lateral flow isotachophoresis diagnostic (LID) technology for chlamydia, which
    currently does not have a POC test available in the US. The proposed technology
    applies an electric field across a lateral flow test to perform isotachophoresis
    (ITP), a powerful method for extracting and concentrating target biomolecules.
    LID improves assay sensitivity by more than 100x, making it suitable for a variety
    of indications that are currently not practical for existing lateral flow assays.
    The increased sensitivity is expected to allow clinicians to make confident diagnoses
    using these tests. This STTR will address key technical hurdles by developing
    the required chemistry and protocols for high accuracy chlamydia diagnostics using
    LID. The ultimate objective of the project is to show that the required electronics
    can be made at low cost and meet regulatory guidelines such as FCC emissions."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide early stage breast cancer patients
    with a comprehensive treatment option that completely eliminates all cancer during
    a patient's first surgery. Currently, >20% of the ~200,000 breast cancer patients
    who are treated with lumpectomy surgery annually in the US must have a re-operation
    because of a lack of clear margins in the initial surgery. Furthermore, most breast
    cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy must also undergo expensive ($17,000+)
    radiation therapy that can last up to 7 weeks. Furthermore, due to the need for
    adjuvant radiation therapy, lumpectomy is not an option for many breast cancer
    patients globally. However, intraoperatively destroying a thin rim of tissue around
    the tumor with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to decrease the need
    for re-operations and radiation therapy. RFA is a thermal ablation therapy used
    commonly in liver and kidney cancer treatment. However, no RFA devices have been
    designed for the post-lumpectomy breast cavity. Development of such a device will
    allow for early stage breast cancer patients worldwide to receive local therapy
    in minutes for a fraction of the cost of radiation. \n\n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop technologies for post-lumpectomy radiofrequency ablation therapy.
    The proposed RFA device is designed such that it will mechanically fit the surgical
    cavity uniformly for optimal treatment. However, a uniform ablation depth around
    the device will not always be desired due to the location of the tumor and skin.
    This project, therefore, also proposes an automated system that can be pre-programmed
    by a surgeon to control the three-dimensional ablation shape produced by the RFA
    device. The following intellectual merits are in the proposed project: (1) a system
    that can create three-dimensional maps of ablation status of tissue (unablated
    vs. undergoing ablation vs. ablated); (2) a system that can create three-dimensional
    ablation shapes using the proposed RFA device. These control systems will be developed
    and validated with benchtop experiments in animal tissues. In the future, this
    will allow early-stage breast cancer patients to receive optimal customized treatment
    with post-lumpectomy RFA to reduce the risk of re-operation and future cancer
    recurrence."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will include providing affordable connected home care for senior citizens (often with severe chronic conditions and incurring significant medical expenses) living independently at home, resulting in significant improvements in healthcare quality and a reduced burden on existing healthcare resources.  This project will not only decrease the burden on family caregivers, who often give up their jobs to provide free care for senior citizens at home, but will also allow organizations such as retirement communities, memory care units and assisted living facilities to monitor multiple patients remotely, thus reducing the need for overworked professional caregivers. This project also aims to overcome deficits present in current home health monitoring technologies by taking a more holistic approach to providing preventive care by using advanced analytics and cutting edge sensor technology that is affordable and accessible to all.

    The proposed project aims to overcome a pressing societal challenge (the burgeoning aging population) facing many developed and emerging countries, including the U.S. (the aging baby boomers) and China (the reverse 4-2-1 family pyramid due to the former one-child policy). Despite failing health, most senior citizens prefer to live independently at home and hence the focus of current healthcare technologies has shifted from traditional clinical care to "at-home" care for senior citizens. The proposed project will develop a smart and connected home monitoring system for senior care that is unique in its technology and service model including: (1) affordable and non-invasive home-based mobile health technology with wearable human and object activity sensors for monitoring health-related motion and daily activities and a cost-effective pre-configured home gateway using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and 3G communication; (2) advanced mobile health analytics algorithms and alerts for fall detection, health progression monitoring, and patient health anomaly detection; and (3) a comprehensive patient health activity portal and support for reporting user activity and health status and engaging with family members. The overall goal is to make aging at home easier, less expensive, and safer for senior citizens.

    to allow for mobile-enabled, rapid correction of improper or dangerous techniques
    in sports activities. The project goal is to eliminate dangerous, unhealthy behaviors
    in young athletes and replace them with non-damaging skills and techniques.  In
    its simplest form, the technology presents a player with a video clip of their
    own behavior, paired with head impact data measured using worn sensors and physics-based
    simulations showing what occurs in the brain during dangerous hits. The quantitative
    biomechanical data is used to predict possible functional brain deficits and presented
    to the user in an age-appropriate manner. By combining a mouth guards with sensors,
    sideline video replay technology, physics-based brain simulations, on-line instruction
    and observational learning, coaches and trainers will be able to correct dangerous
    techniques and behaviors in sports activity as they occur. Coaches and trainers
    will also be able to show players video of their own technique following a significant
    impact to the head next to a synchronized clip of an athlete completing the same
    movements, but with no head impact. As a result, children and adolescents will
    learn there is never an acceptable level of head contact. Whether applied to football,
    hockey, lacrosse, soccer or one of any number of physical activities, this coaching
    tool will provide immediate instruction and self-reinforcing behavior modification.\n
    \nThe proposed technology enables unprecedented resolution of the biomechanical
    response during sports activities by combining synchronized video, wearable impact
    sensors and physics-based simulations that will identify dangerous incidents,
    with the goal of obtaining real time technique modification and therefore a dramatic
    reduction in the occurrence of injury.  It is important to note that while sensor
    technology and analytical methods have advanced dramatically in the last several
    years, the integration of synchronized video technology would be a critical tool
    in helping players understand and prevent dangerous head impacts from occurring
    in contact sports.  The mobile apps will be an innovative approach to reducing
    the number and severity of concussive and sub concussive blows to the head. Integrating
    sensor data, synchronized with video technology and physics-based impact simulations
    showing what occurs in the brain during dangerous impacts into a mobile app is
    innovative to the sporting industry and offers an opportunity to improve player
    safety in sports. The broader impact of the system is to show students and athletes
    dangerous techniques as soon as they occur along side of how their behavior could
    be modified, which will reduce the occurrence of serious injuries in sports and
    fitness pursuits causing health-enhancing activities to be rendered much safer."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a cell sorting system to allow separation of two or more cell types to be used in cell therapies for treatment of cancer and other diseases.  Purification of specific cell populations from complex materials such as blood is a critical component of cell therapy manufacturing. However, since most protocols for clinical-grade cell purification rely on binding of magnetic particles to cells, promising cell therapies face the risk of transplanting residual and potentially toxic magnetic particles to human subjects. The steps currently required to eliminate this risk add complexity, time and cost to cell therapy manufacturing, limiting the wide-scale usefulness of promising new cell therapies. This project will develop a novel cell separation technology, free of magnetic particles, that can be readily scaled to levels required to enable clinical-scale manufacturing of highly pure and highly viable cell-based therapeutics. The aim is to perform multi-target cell sorting while simultaneously leaving cells free from contaminating tags.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel affinity chromatographic cell sorting (AFFICS) system, based on proprietary dissolvable hydrogel microbeads, for efficient simultaneous separation of two and more cell types directly from heterogeneous cell environments without requiring magnetic or fluorescent tagging of cells. To achieve this, the objectives are to 1) Design a column-based affinity chromatographic system with functionalized dissolvable hydrogel microbeads for single surface marker-based cell isolation from complex cell suspensions, leading to cell capture and target cell populations with >85% purity and viability. 2) Develop tandem connection of multiple columns for sequential cell separation based on two or more surface markers on a large scale. 3) Optimize the rapid release mechanism required for efficient simultaneous separation of two and more cell subpopulations while maintaining cell phenotype and viability. The proposed system will provide multi-target cell sorting at clinical scale while simultaneously leaving cells free of residual magnetic or fluorescent affinity tags.

    This SBIR Phase I project attempts to address a fundamental question for innovators: is my idea already patented?  This do-it-yourself-initially service will empower small-business enterprises with synthesized research of over 10 million patent documents within 10 minutes based on the concepts contained within the idea. Such a comprehensive, real-time, low-cost offering is currently unavailable for small-business entrepreneurs.  Current search tools do not synthesize the results into an executive summary, do not allow an entire document to be entered as the search input, and do not perform real-time concept/correlation computations.  This proposed innovation will enable the inventor to submit an entire document (the idea) as the search query; then, utilizing network mathematics and artificial-intelligence algorithms, this service will synthesize search results in real-time summarizing what patent documents are most related to the idea based on natural-language processing.  Such a service for small-business entrepreneurs would enable them to initially ascertain the novelty of their idea and give them an on-the-go education about the natural language used in patent documents in comparison to their idea.  This meta-innovation would objectively ascertain the intellectual-property merit of any proposed technology, enable small-business innovators, and foster the acceleration of innovation development in the United States.

    The development of latent semantic analysis (LSA) has enabled algorithm development to extract latent (or hidden) semantic structure from documents addressing two important word-sense ambiguity issues that text-matching search cannot: polysemy (single term with multiple meanings; i.e., strike as to hit [verb], to start up [verb], or to cease working [noun]) and synonymy (multiple terms with single meaning; i.e., car and automobile).  Albeit robust, this concept-search approach for large document collections is not tractable due to the high-complexity computational requirements for performing matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) necessary for LSA.   Approximation techniques that use subset approaches necessarily introduce some amount of systematic error.  To ascertain the most relevant documents in a large collection for a given focal document, this proposed innovation (search-subset LSA) will subset using proprietary search methodologies without any systematic error, reducing both the number of documents to compare and the number of terms to analyze thereby making real-time document correlations possible.  The aims of this research are: to identify the optimal subset approach for comprehensive nomological capture of top-correlation candidates, to ascertain optimal input parameters for the focal query document, and to develop a statistical test to confirm that no systematic bias is present in this approach.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will improve motivation, learning and self-esteem of children by incorporating well-established principles from behavioral psychology and gaming science.  The innovation disrupts conventional paradigms by advantageously leveraging the exploding screen time trends of digital games and social media, which are commonly a nemesis to learning and attention span.  Children's interactions with this system will provide insights into their ability to delay gratification, a skill that is critically linked to many positive societal and life outcomes.  Initially, the innovation will address a critical need to offer a personalized approach to accelerate compliance with Common Core Standards (Common Core) related to math fluency and mastery. Once the premise is validated, the new system will be used with the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder population to improve attention span and reduce impulsivity. Ultimately, the platform will integrate with existing learning management systems administered by schools so a variety of subjects including STEM and Common Core can be featured.  This combination will create a revolutionary education platform that is delivered through smart devices, so different types of learning can occur at home, school or on the go, thereby, making state-of-the art learning technologies readily available to diverse social economic groups.


    The technical innovation is a tablet and smartphone-based learning system that uses a neuro-cognitive model of a child's mental state to determine the optimal parameters to maximize learning as well as boost attention span.   Underlying the patent-pending platform are adaptive algorithms that merge established behavioral training principles including those from Precision Teaching and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder treatments together with the latest trends in gaming science.  Concurrently, the innovation will create behavioral and reward mechanisms intended to increase the level of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in both the learning and reward systems.  Tangentially, the innovation will accelerate important neurological pathways that can free up working memory and improve self-esteem. A paramount outcome is to create a comprehensive software exchange that can be delivered through all types of smart devices.  The project goal involves writing new software and algorithms, leveraging established software and evaluating the software and algorithms with controlled experiments. The technical hurdles to be addressed include: 1) creating new algorithms for an adaptive math-fact curriculum that improve math skills and attention span, 2) enhancing existing data stack with state-of-art machine learning that maintains higher learning performance and motivation, and 3) demonstrating consistent trends in classroom, tutoring and home settings.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will enable biomolecular research by developing a high precision micropump utilizing a magnetic shape memory (MSM) mechanism. The MSM mechanism translates magnetic energy into mechanical work through an MSM alloy. The MSM material replaces many of the mechanical parts found in other micropump technologies and can precisely manipulate the very small fluid volumes handled by many researchers, such as biomolecular physicists and electro-neurophysiologists. Precision micro-dosing will decrease the costs of such research by decreasing the volume of reagents consumed and by increasing the efficacy and efficiency of experiments. This project will develop laboratory instrumentation for the institutional research market and will later expand to enter the nearly $3 billion microfluidic devices market. It will further develop MSM technology that will translate to multiple markets including healthcare. The broader impacts range from improvements in personalized medicine through point-of-care diagnostics, to the development of more efficient drugs, for example in cancer treatment, through enhanced pharmaceutical research.

    The intellectual merit of this project focuses on increasing the pumping resolution of the MSM micropump for precision micro-dosing for laboratory research. The pump design is biomimetic and works similarly to how mammals swallow. By applying a magnetic field, a peristaltic motion is generated in the MSM material which can be used to repeatedly pump precise quantities of fluid. This technology boasts a unique combination of features including (1) contact-free magnetic actuation, (2) no mechanical parts, (3) combination of the pumping mechanism and valve into a single element, (4) reversibility of the flow direction, (5) operation even with a high back pressure, (6) applicability to gases and viscous liquids, and (7) high precision at small volumes. Reducing the size of the MSM magneto-mechanical transducer will increase the pumping resolution. Since the surface-area-to-volume ratio is larger for smaller MSM transducers, surface stresses must be controlled more delicately. One key outcome of this work will be the development of surface treatment methods to improve magneto-mechanical fatigue life and the performance of the device. Through systematic experiments, this project will establish fundamental processing-structure-properties-performance relationships for MSM transducers, and will also demonstrate prototype devices for biomolecular research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to refine, broaden and characterize a new family of optical chemosensor dyes designed for real-time monitoring and control of heavy-metal concentrations in industrial wastewater discharge. This will allow metal platers, metal finishers, circuit board manufacturers, ink manufacturers, and a multitude of other businesses that discharge heavy metal waste, the capability to reduce treatment costs by an average of 25% to 40%.  At the same time, this technology will assist in improving compliance with discharge limits defined by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Act and by local regulatory agencies. This would in turn reduce toxic metal treatment costs at downstream municipal wastewater treatment plants. It is estimated from market surveys that at least 15,000 businesses in the United States are potential customers for such a system.  The global market in this vertical is estimated to be at least $2 billion.  In addition, many other market segments, such as defense and homeland security, could potentially use these chemosensor arrays to permit accurate detection of heavy metals in real-world conditions.

    The intellectual merit of this project is that it further develops and evaluates a family of chemosensor dyes that are inherently stable over time and can be used for continuous, real-time, heavy-metal monitoring in wastewater treatment processes with detection limits relevant to environmental regulations. Earlier work demonstrated that sets of several of these dyes have significant promise to accurately and continuously measure the concentration of specific metals in wastewater effluent. To quantify each metal ion of interest, the output of multiple dyes is analyzed to provide accurate identification of specific metals.  Rigid attachment to the sensing platform allows for longer-term deployment.  Specifically, this project intends to demonstrate and evaluate the response of a sensor array to several heavy metals identified, based on customer surveys, as the primary analytical needs of the wastewater industry. This effort will include the quantification of relevant metal ions and an evaluation of the stability of those measurements over time in several flow systems which will be assembled.  A viable sensing platform prototype is envisioned at the end of a successful project.  Moving forward, further dyes can be added to allow quantification of other metals over the concentration ranges of interest, with minimal interference.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop an intracellular delivery technology for positively charged peptides for use in cell experiments in basic laboratory science and for delivery of peptide therapeutics for treatment of human disease. Peptides hold many advantages over the small molecule drugs that dominate the current healthcare market in terms of potency, specificity, and biocompatibility, and they are faster and easier to implement than genetic modifications for completion of hypothesis-driven studies. Peptides can inhibit enzymes and alter protein-protein interactions to have profound effects on cellular behavior. Despite these advantages, peptides suffer from poor intracellular uptake and entrapment within intracellular compartments, thereby preventing access to their intracellular target and limiting their potential as research tools and therapeutics. Positively charged cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) will be used to improve peptide uptake by cells.  The proposed polyplex peptide delivery technology is designed to be a user-friendly reagent that further enhances CPP peptide uptake and dramatically improves potency and durability of action by enabling escape from intracellular compartments. The polyplex technology will fill this current gap in the delivery reagent market, bolstering peptide use and accelerating scientific advancement, and also enable peptide therapeutic approaches for intracellular targets.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to leverage the properties of an anionic pH-responsive polymer to provide a more cost-effective, easy-to-use peptide delivery reagent that increases peptide uptake and longevity of action without cellular toxicity. The proposed work is focused on achieving the following aims: 1) Optimize a standardized formulation protocol that is effective for a broad range of peptides modified with positively charged cell-penetrating peptides by analyzing the physicochemical properties of a library of peptide-reagent formulations. 2) Verify polyplex-mediated peptide delivery efficiency as assessed by cellular peptide uptake across a broad spectrum of cell types, including both adherent and suspension cells as well as hard-to-transfect primary cell lines. 3) Establish advantages over competing delivery reagents in terms of ease of use, potency, duration of intracellular retention, and activity and biocompatibility. These aims will be achieved through the use of dynamic light scattering analysis, flow cytometric analysis of peptide uptake and retention, microscopy-based analysis of intracellular peptide localization, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Successful completion of these studies will establish the commercial viability of the peptide delivery reagent and enable the subsequent development of a prototype reagent kit for field testing.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a cutting-edge nanotechnology
    that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such
    as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential
    to changing regenerative healthcare forever. It would change biobanking for on-demand
    cells and tissues and improve mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical
    procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all
    levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment
    of a final product to patient. Yet, critically, the field lacks the ability to
    safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines severely limiting
    product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable
    than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient
    (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or
    transport distances. More people will die from premature organ failure than cancer.
    \ Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will
    significantly enhance national healthcare.  The US faces strong commercial and
    competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including
    organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant
    savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies
    with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly
    $250 billion per year in the U.S.\n  \n\nThe cytotoxicity of current biopreservation
    techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water
    delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage
    from ice formation. The goal of this project is to establish a fundamentally different
    approach to cryoprotective agent optimization by developing first-in-the-field
    bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient
    intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation.
    Past research has demonstrated the reliability of constructing well-defined nanotubular
    assemblies via the enforced stacking of shape-persistent macrocycles based on
    the interplay of multiple hydrogen-bonding, dipole-dipole, and aromatic pi-pi
    stacking interactions and their self-insertion into lipid bilayers. These rationally
    designed organic nanopores will serve as selective transmembrane channels when
    protein channels malfunction at or below 3 °C. As a result, the cell's exposure
    time to reach ice-free cryopreservation temperature will be significantly reduced.
    Post-preservation cell yield and viability will be greatly improved by reducing
    intracellular ice formation. Upon rewarming, these organic nanopores will facilitate
    rapid removal of the cryoprotective agents. At physiological temperature, the
    nanopores will seal off, and be washed out from the system resulting in low toxicity.
    Nanopore function and effect will be examined using liposome-based glucose transport,
    cell-based toxicity and cell-based cryopreservation assays."

    kitting and stitching machine.  This demonstration machine will be capable of
    placing, cutting and securing 6 layers of dry composite material in parallel.
    \ The parallel nature of the process greatly improves manufacturing time, while
    the reel-to-reel capable layout of the machine allows for manufacturing of long
    continuous laminates using a comparatively small machine footprint.  The key technical
    hurdles will be software control and mechanical management of multiple parallel
    plies.  During this research project Green Dynamics will demonstrate the proposed
    machine control proposal and mechanical system layout, which allows multiple plies
    to spool in parallel and be cut on individual gantries simultaneously.  The Green
    Dynamics lamination kitting and stitching machine will demonstrate the labor and
    cost savings that can be achieved through automated manufacturing of a single
    piece laminate.  These savings will enable the continued reduction in cost for
    composite materials, and spur their growth into new markets. Decreasing the cost
    and improving the quality of composite structures such as wind turbine blades
    and automotive components is a key path to lower carbon emissions. \n\n\nThe proposed
    manufacturing machine handles multiple fabric rolls in parallel and uses proprietary
    control algorithms and fabric handling methods to cut and secure up to 6 layers
    of material simultaneously. As individual layers are processed independently the
    resulting laminate stack is highly tailored and places material only where it
    is needed. The final product is transportable, and for very long length parts,
    can be rolled up to minimize transport size. At the manufacturing location this
    laminate is placed in the tool in a single step, which greatly reduces the time
    to manufacture the part and the process time in the tool. No other composite automation
    machine can provide a single piece lamination which is tailored in multiple directions.
    The resulting laminate effectively uses the orthotropic properties of composite
    materials to achieve lower weights while enabling much lower touch labor rates.
    The multi-roll, linear orientation of our machine allows for reel to reel processing
    of long narrow laminates in a small machine footprint, and results in a rolled,
    transportable laminate."

    \ This transformative initiative, built with game technology and clinical algorithms,

    innovative Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for medical schools to access
    via a cost-effective subscription model on mobile devices and computers.  This
    proposed project will demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility by creating
    a proof of concept pilot with a prominent medical school collaborator. This platform
    will ultimately serve medical schools and teaching hospitals (over 400 in the
    United States alone), over 1900 nursing programs, and eventually hospital systems

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a working prototype for an interactive search and visualization tool that redefines how social scientists and business practitioners interested in scholarly research findings identify such findings. Instead of reading through numerous, unstructured, and often irrelevant text results (such as those produced by traditional academic search engines), users get to (a) instantly view and easily navigate research findings via intuitively-structured, clickable visual maps, and (b) accurately identify those papers most relevant to them, thanks to semantically intelligent indexing and visual reconciliation. This efficiency-enhancing tool makes research findings substantially easier to understand and explore, while drastically cutting down search times for such findings (to half or even less) which will ultimately enhance the efficiency of research endeavors at U.S. universities. Moreover, various inquiries have shown that practitioners in applied fields such as marketing or management place high value on academic research in the social sciences, yet often find such research difficult to understand. The proposed solution distills social science findings into an easily digestible format, hence facilitating the knowledge transfer between academia and businesses, and enhancing the value of academic research to society. Finally, by being marketed as a subscription-based service to both academics and business practitioners, the proposed tool has the potential to generate substantial commercial value in the long term (up to $50 million in annual revenue).

    The proposed tool fundamentally alters the existing search paradigm in the social sciences, by changing both the way in which research findings from academic papers are indexed, and how such findings are visually presented. It combines an innovation on the back-end (i.e., using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to automatically extract concepts and causal relationships from academic research papers, and semantically categorize those concepts against a set of discipline-specific thesauri) with an innovation on the front-end (i.e., using aggregate causal mapping to represent the academic literature in the form of interactive maps that can be visually explored and narrowed down in order to precisely locate relevant papers). The main research objective is to test the feasibility of (1) using NLU for accurately identifying and extracting the underlying concepts/variables and causal structure of the studies described in a large set of social science research papers (approximately 1,000 published papers), and of (2) automatically rendering the extracted information in the form of causal maps that both academic and non-academic users can intuitively understand and navigate. This research objective has been reached if a group of test users employ the proposed tool to successfully identify research papers examining particular concepts and relationships, and do so in about half the time needed when using a traditional academic search engine for the same task.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project revolves around the democratization of extremely complex motion generation, perception, and control systems. Most roboticists today program without understanding heat transfer, motor controllers, and lowlevel
    message passing. Abstractions improve robot accessibility and enable organizations to leverage a broader range of expertise. This project will further the modern robotics abstraction to obviate specialized knowledge of low level task processes such as movement and vision across a variety of robots. Product driven companies are best suited to develop business logic and a thoughtful customer
    experience, and most struggle to acquire suitable in-house talent to remain competitive with foundational robotics techniques. This system addresses fundamental behavioral prerequisites for applications ranging from collaborative robotics in manufacturing and fulfillment to assistive robotics, caretaking, and personal home robotics as well as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
    autonomous vehicles, and entertainment robots. With higher level interfaces, programmers can more easily leverage their creativity and intuition enabling a new generation of applications unhindered by the present day difficulties of low level development. Beyond the commercial potential, these advantages are pervasive: researchers, students, and children alike, of all genders and ethnicities, will be empowered to interact with, program, and study robots at a substantially higher level.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the increasing need for a higher level interface to robots that abstracts away perception, motion generation, and control. Many competing techniques for motion generation and perception populate the literature, but recently optimization has become a common unifying theme playing a prominent role in continuously running and adapting behavior with the promise of speed and generality. This project will utilize state of the art technology in continuous motion optimization and modern real time vision and tracking techniques to build an integrated system appropriate for use across multiple robots. These techniques involve optimization, Riemannian geometry, low level control, online learning and more&#894; many components are well suited to generalizing across robotic platforms, but questions remain regarding processing speed, robustness, and the utility of
    existing modeling tools. This project will assess the viability of such a higher level system by studying the latencies of reactions, precision of manipulation, and its long term robustness especially in the context of collaborative robotics for manufacturing using evaluations across multiple physical robotic platforms. The technical results will illuminate the role of optimization in
    motion generation and perception for real world productionizable systems and uncover any remaining scientific question that must be addressed.

    This SBIR Phase I project will enable the development of a game-based, mobile cross-cutting physics and chemistry application for students in grades 9-12. In 2011 the National Research Council (NRC) published the final framework for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The NGSS, which have been adopted by 17 states and the District of Columbia, place an emphasis on cross-cutting science, technology, math and engineering (STEM) concepts, but these concepts are often not yet incorporated in 9-12 grade curriculum. By leveraging the intrinsic appeal and intuitive nature of interactive media for learning, this project aims to address this gap, engendering student engagement with a learn-by-doing approach that incorporates problem solving and rewards student progress. Interactive media, specifically game-based learning, is beginning to gain momentum in classrooms as a complement to teacher-led instruction. The engagement of more young people in science is critical for our nation, both to create informed citizens and to properly prepare the next generation of skilled professionals. In addition to directly creating several jobs for skilled US citizens, the efforts of this project will contribute to a commercially viable mobile application for an educational technologies industry that is currently valued at $1.5 billion per annum and growing.

    This project will focus on radiant energy, including its physical attributes, how these attributes interact with the natural world (chemical, biological, geological, astronomical), and how radiant energy is harnessed for engineering and technological applications. This will lead students to think about real-world scenarios and learn how the natural connectivity of STEM will enable them to formulate a broad mental lattice which emphasizes the deep relationships within the biological, physical, and mathematical worlds. Light in the broad sense is electromagnetic radiant energy and includes radio waves, UV irradiation, visible light, gamma rays. Regardless of which type it is, the speed of light is the same, c, = 2.9979245Å~108 m s-1. This connection is often lost on students as there is no suitable way of teaching this in the classroom. In concert with the NGSS and the powerful potential of interactive applications in modeling complex systems, this project will give educators a tool to communicate these concepts using a hands-on approach. This innovation is based on evidence that active participation in learning can increase information retention rates by as much as 45% when compared to traditional lecture or audiovisual teaching techniques. In addition, the element of gamification further increases student engagement and sense of achievement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a commercially feasible, drug-releasing contact lens for treatment of glaucoma. Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, was estimated to affect 64 million people world-wide in 2013. This is expected to rise to approximately 112 million affected individuals by 2040. The primary treatment is topical eye drops that patients must self-administer at least once per day. These eye drops provide a very short (a few minutes) burst of drug exposure to the cornea, with more than 90% of the drug being washed away. Furthermore, poor patient compliance with this tedious daily application accounts for substantial worsening of disease and increased healthcare costs. This SBIR project will develop a new glaucoma treatment standard that overcomes the many shortfalls of topical eye drops, resolving issues of drug absorption and patient compliance with targeted and controlled drug delivery (better absorption) and extended wear (less tedious, better compliance). If successful, this approach could serve as a platform technology for innovating future ocular treatments.

    The proposed project solves key issues that currently hinder the adequate pharmaceutical treatment of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. The goal of this SBIR project is to utilize specially designed drug-carrying nanoparticles to achieve a near constant rate of delivery from a contact lens to the cornea. These "smart" nanoparticles, which will be integrated into contact lens formulations, will respond to the microenvironment of the tear film to trigger a sustained release of the drug. Comparing with the common eye drops, the glaucoma treatment via contact lens is anticipated to achieve a sustainable drug delivery at a near constant rate, higher bioavailability (much higher than 5%), and with substantially reduced risk of unintended systemic toxicity.

    to provide adequate power and robust signal to noise ratios for fatigue sensing
    under real world, dynamic spectrum loading scenarios.   \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project to design and develop a piezoelectric
    fatigue fuse aims to address the growing problem of transit asset management in
    the United States. The recent series of bridge failures in the US exemplifies
    the public safety risks of ageing infrastructure and    without a method to inspect
    and monitor fatigue in steel structures with improved accuracy and efficiency,
    the safety and serviceability of these structures is at an ever-increasing risk.
    The aim of developing and introducing PFF?s is to provide a measure of loading
    history that correlates with fatigue crack growth to predict current state-of-life
    and dictate economic options for future inspection and repair frequency. This
    will be accomplished by developing a system which transduces the mechanical loading
    of a structure into electrical energy which is simultaneously used to charge low-power
    electronics and generate digital data corresponding to the fatigue life of the
    asset. The key technical results of this program will be the measured electrical
    response of optimized PFF sensors, an understanding of signal modulation as the
    mechanical fuses accrue fatigue damage and the requirements of the low power electronics
    and radios necessary to make these systems truly self-powered."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a commercially-viable human cell-based model to screen experimental drugs for their efficacy in treating myelin disorders. Current screening methods used in the R&D of new drugs fail to successfully predict translation from discovery to clinical success. This absence results in high attrition rates, increased development time, and significant R&D costs, most acutely in neurological applications. Pharmaceutical companies devote up to 15 years and spend over $2B to bring a single drug to market. On average, 89% of drugs entering clinical trials fail, while drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS) fail at a rate of 92%, due largely to the poor predictive validity of current animal models. As a case study of demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States and 2.5 million people worldwide. MS therapeutics represent a $17.2B global market, with an estimated late-stage preclinical testing market of $50M annually. Development of the proposed screening platform has the potential to better predict clinical efficacy, while substantially reducing the time and cost associated with developing new drugs for MS and other demyelinating disorders, accelerating treatments for millions of patients.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to establish the technical feasibility of using a 3D model of living nerve/brain tissue for screening drugs to treat disorders of myelin, the fatty encasement surrounding nerve axons. The project aims to build on preliminary work to include cells relevant to the central nervous system. It will then be shown that myelination, demyelination, and remyelination can be assessed using clinically-relevant, physiological metrics. The final goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a humanized assay, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, a renewable source of human cells. The resultant model system will be truly unique, comprised of human cells in an anatomical arrangement that mimics living nerve tissue, unlocking the potential for clinically-relevant metrics far earlier in the drug development lifecycle.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the development of a piezoelectric energy harvesting fiber to autonomously power sensors and other low-power electronics in smart garments. This technology will allow the fabrication of garments with seamlessly integrated energy harvesting systems, as opposed to today's rigid electronics, to enable smart garments to move toward the same breathability, fit and comfort as normal clothing. The smart garments market is forecast to continue growing at nearly 20% per year over the next several years, reaching $2 billion by 2018. While there has been significant publicity around the development of smart garments for measuring various physiological conditions of athletes, the broader impact of this technology includes applications for monitoring soldiers, emergency responders and patients where the loss of sensor power (e.g. for body function monitoring or environmental sensing) could be dire. While this project will focus on one particular fiber chemistry, the expected learning that will result in terms of fiber processing and integration into fabric structures will also be applicable to other fiber technologies.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with understanding the behavior of fiber-based piezoelectrics as they are processed into yarns and fabrics. Historically, ceramic and polymer piezoelectric materials are used in rigid or flexible film forms, which are not suitable for the development of wearable textile-based technologies. This effort focuses on a new class of piezoelectric polymer fiber, poly(gamma-benzyl-alpha,L-glutamate) (ePBLG), than can be produced in a single electrospinning process and without the need for physical or chemical post-processing to yield its piezo-activity. The three primary goals of the work will be: understanding the effect of polymer and process conditions on fiber dielectric properties, assessing and optimizing the mechanical and dielectric properties of ePBLG yarns, and evaluating the electrical output of a variety of orthogonal electrodes, as would be appropriate for woven fabric constructions. Through this work we will determine the effects on power output when transforming the ePBLG material into structures required for seamless incorporation into smart garments. With this knowledge, the piezoelectric power supply can be properly sized for the balance-of-system within a specific smart garment design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its capability to create a positive impact for every wireless system. This project concentrates on the antenna element along with control algorithms and targets commercial wireless communication applications, i.e., 5G cellular small cells. As any wireless platform uses an antenna, an advancement accomplished for this element will create a positive impact for every wireless system. For example, the tactical military antennas must not only have reduced size, signature and cost, but must also ensure that maximum efficiency, dynamic mutual coupling tolerance and coverage area are achievable at all times, for any frequency and in any kind of environment. The proposed multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology with dynamically changeable properties is ideal for military and commercial antenna applications. Society will benefit from the increased array of applications of wireless networks driven by the proposed innovative design principles and MRA technologies. This project also has a strong educational component and will provide excellent opportunities to train students at undergraduate and graduate levels in interdisciplinary fields that combine wireless communication theory, antenna design, and fabrication technologies. If successful, this project will significantly enhance accessing the wireless spectrum.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project targets to revolutionize the way wireless communication is performed by developing a new class of antenna technology called multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA). The frequency band, radiation pattern and polarization properties of an antenna directly impact the coverage, capacity, and quality of service achieved by wireless networks. Particularly, 5G and beyond wireless systems must employ multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology to attain improved spectral efficiency, advanced interference management capability, higher network capacities and energy efficiencies with reduced cost, size and weight. However, achievement of this represents a significant challenge particularly if the MIMO systems use legacy antenna technology, which has not seen much change since the invention of antennas more than 100 years ago. The intelligence of these systems is limited to adaptive signal processing, which are optimized in isolation independent from antenna properties that are assumed fixed. The proposed MRA technology enables a single antenna element to dynamically change its properties, thereby the joint optimization of all system parameters (environment, EM wave properties, and communication algorithms). Success on this frontier has the potential to revolutionize the antenna systems in terms of agility, performance, power consumption, cost, and size.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies primarily in its contribution to the rehabilitation robotics, assistive technologies and collaborative robotics fields. Technologists engaged in developing devices and products in these fields are greatly benefiting from the lower prices of electronics brought on by the growth of the telecommunications industry, but those same technologists don?t have ready access to compliantly controlled actuators that make physical robot-human interaction safe. Developing such actuators is costly, it takes a long time, and it requires very specific and rare expertise.  The introduction of a new line of inexpensive (as compared to existing technologies), highly backdrivable linear actuators onto the market will enable a new breed of robotic rehabilitation and assistive products, as well as co-robots and perhaps even gaming interfaces with haptic feedback.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a proof of concept of the compliant force control module (CFCM), for converting simple linear screw-driven actuators into highly backdrivable, force-controlled actuators.  There is great interest and opportunity in co-robots, but in order for these devices to safely manipulate objects and interact haptically with humans, they must be inherently safe.  Compliant force-controlled actuators can render such co-robots safe, but due to their novelty such equipment is not commercially available.  A proprietary force sensor design will be implemented and research will be performed on various methods for achieving high performance with sufficient stability margins in both hardware and software.  Research will be performed on control algorithm approaches for minimizing the effects of mechanical play, stiction and inertia.  The use of visco-elastic materials as the compliant element to replace the purely elastic elements (springs) will be investigated for the potential to mitigate the mechanical issues found in economical mechanical transmissions.  The ultimate goal of the proposed effort is to demonstrate the improved force-control performance of an off-the-shelf linear actuator when equipped with the CFCM technology.

    Research (SBIR) project will be to increase wood production of managed loblolly
    pine tree farms by 20%. Global demand for forest industry products, e.g., pulp
    for paper, saw timber, and wood pellets for fuel, is expected to rise 60-100%
    by 2060. As the world's 4th largest exporter of forest products, the U.S. is well
    positioned to help meet these growing needs. To do so, managed loblolly pine tree
    farms will play a large role in supplying the demand. Using a biotechnology gene
    trait approach to introduce cell wall gene technology, the goal is to engineer
    pine trees with 20% more wood density over conventional crops. This may result
    in more wood material per tree, per acre with no added cost to production processing,
    i.e., no increase use of land, water, or fertilizers. As an added benefit, bioengineered
    trees with cell wall gene technologies aid in protecting the environment by sequestering
    more atmospheric CO2 thus helping to combat the negative effects of global climate
    change. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of renewable materials

    wall density in loblolly pine. Bioengineered plants will be selected using herbicide
    resistance and the effects of transgene incorporation analyzed through gene expression
    and histochemical analysis. The anticipated outcome of this project will be 400
    bioengineered pine seedlings with greater strength and increased value to be tested
    in greenhouse and field trials once approved. This project will serve as proof-of-concept
    testing for select cell wall gene technologies in commercial tree crops towards
    technology commercialization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program will be to develop a technology to convert the acid whey waste generated by Greek yogurt production into a natural sweetener. The Greek yogurt industry is on the rise. However, making authentic Greek yogurt is a wasteful process - producing 3 parts waste for every part of Greek yogurt made. An economical use of Greek yogurt waste will capture the full value of the waste materials, minimize waste transportation cost, decrease bacterial outbreak risk, and reduce the carbon footprint for the environment. In parallel, the technology will ensure a sustainable supply of a rare low-calorie natural sweetener, which was shown to help lower blood sugar and improve cholesterol levels, in addition to its antioxidant, anti-cavity and pro-digestive properties. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of conversion of non-food biomass to value-added chemicals.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to develop engineered yeast as a self-renewing biocatalyst for processing the environmentally hazardous waste from Greek yogurt production into a low-calorie natural sweetener. Greek yogurt companies struggle to dispose of its waste. The waste, which contains significant amounts of lactose, cannot be discarded without a pretreatment step because it stimulates bacterial growth, polluting water systems. The research addresses this challenge through the development of self-sustained microbes as catalysts in a continuous process, allowing lactose uptake with minimal waste pretreatment. This process produces a low-calorie natural sweetener as a product, whose market supply is currently limited by production cost. Anticipated technical results include strains with high yield and productivity, a specific product purification method and successful assembly of a live yeast reactor. The design overcomes substantial financial, logistical and thermodynamic bottlenecks in Greek yogurt waste treatment, and the low-calorie natural sweetener production.

    are key components in a number of important physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions
    (e.g., tumor angiogenesis, thrombosis); however, developing a detailed understanding
    of these roles, which may significantly impact human health, is challenging due
    to a lack of analytical techniques for glycan analysis and the absence of high

    in cell signaling cascades, which can vary depending on the particular GAG structural
    composition. Particular GAG compositions vary among different tissue types as
    well as among different developmental and physiological states. Hence, to achieve
    the proper functional characteristics and obtain reproducible experimental results,
    it is critical that GAG samples are available with consistent and defined compositions.
    Unfortunately, most commercially available GAG samples are from animal sources
    with high inherent variability and are not well characterized. The potential for

    less desirable for human therapeutics. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes
    to develop genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells producing

    A series of engineered cell lines will be produced in order to prepare GAGs with
    different compositions that model the different compositions and different functional

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to reduce pathogenic salmonella carriage in poultry. The challenge addressed is the one of foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections. These infections are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Of alarming concern is the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. A major source of drug-resistance development is the widespread use of antibiotics in animal production. An estimated 70% of all antibiotics produced in the US are administered to livestock, primarily to promote growth and improve feed efficiency, even in the absence of infection. This sub-therapeutic administration of antibiotics to animals creates a vast reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant bacteria.  As a potential solution to this problem, probiotic bacteria will be engineered that express and secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals. In this application, the focus is on chickens, a significant source of animal protein in diets around the globe. Foodborne Salmonella infects millions of people in the US every year, and the major source of Salmonella poisoning are poultry products. The goal is to reduce carriage of Salmonella in chickens to ensure safe food and reduce the need for antibiotics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess a new, transformative antibiotic technology. Antibiotic, AMP-producing probiotics will be used to reduce pathogens in poultry intestines. Pathogens in poultry intestines are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. AMPs are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. Probiotics will be tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be delivered safely in food or water. Synthetic biological DNA promoter regions will be employed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection. The impact of controllable AMP delivery will be examined in poultry challenged by Salmonella Enteritidis, a common foodborne pathogen. The impact will be examined for live biotherapeutic bacteria on the microbiota present in the GI tracts of poultry. This project will result in the following advances in discovery/development: 1) Discovery of antimicrobial peptides that selectively target Salmonella spp. 2) Development of peptide expression and secretion cassettes for probiotics; 3) Development of probiotics that competitively inhibit the growth of Salmonella spp.; 4) Development of probiotics that may be supplied safely to farm animals; and 5) Development of probiotics that positively modulate the gut microbiome of poultry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will a new type of liquid-handling robot.  Currently, most liquid handling in biology research is carried out manually. Due to the complexity and high cost of automated systems compared with the ease-of-use and low cost of manual instruments, automation primarily benefits a few industrial, high-throughput applications. However, new ideas and discoveries typically take place on a much smaller scale, and, thus, the tremendous impact, by way of repeatable science, promised by automation is diminished. This project provides an easy-to-use tool, priced on par with manual pipettors, which may have an immediate positive impact on biology research labs worldwide. By bringing repeatable protocols and reduced complexity to the market, this project will change the way biologists approach bench-top science, improving repeatability and the rate of innovation in the life sciences.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an automation platform for laboratory liquid handling based on a miniature liquid handling robot controlled by a new language to capture biological protocols.  It fits like a lid on the top of a microtiter plate, and it can accompany the plate for the duration of a days-long protocol, even in the incubator, and carry out all or most of the liquid-handling steps of the protocol. In addition, the accompanying software will be designed to improve reproducibility and record-keeping in bench biology work. The goal is to maintain precision volume dispensing while minimizing cross-contamination and providing continuous monitoring and liquid management in a miniature robot. This will require a robot moving precisely in four axes while constrained to the approximate volume of a cup of coffee. The software will be designed to create a general language for capturing biology protocols.  This project aims to improve laboratory standards and allow exchange of experiment designs.

    This project researches and develops a novel mathematics communication and collaboration system. Mathematics is the foundation of Science and Technology, and national competence in the STEM fields is essential to maintaining our competitive edge on a global scale. Math literacy hinges on effective communication of mathematical concepts and processes. However, despite significant advances in pedagogical methods, the way we communicate mathematics remains curiously behind the times. Preliminary customer and market research has revealed that the lack of adequate communication tools for mathematical and technical expressions is holding back the advance of mathematics in online environments such as online tutoring. Moreover, the scarcity of effective communication tools has reinforced the long-standing preconception that math is primarily a solitary activity, and it has created an unintended and harmful selection bias restricting the diversity of students entering STEM fields. This project fills the void of adequate math communications tools with an dynamic, interactive system for communicating mathematical derivations in real-time in an online environment. The system facilitates student-student and student-teacher remote communication of mathematics, and it is particularly suited for student-tutor communication on online tutoring platforms.

    The math communication and collaboration system this project develops leverages the company's proprietary equation manipulation technology. This system employs an integrated math engine and a touch-based interface allowing users to manipulate equations using simple drag-and-drop gestures. It is built on a game-engine allowing for multi-player support. This project integrates the equation manipulation technology into a networked multi-user interface to connect one or more users for real-time communication of mathematical derivations. The project researches the precise needs of students, teachers, and online tutors to tailor the user interface to the specific needs of online mathematics communication. Specific problems the project researches include multi-player networking and matchmaking functionality, optimal network architecture for the system, transfer of control between users for effective communication, integration of traditional communication tools within the system, and reduction of latency time to enhance real-time interactivity. Successful completion of the project will result in a first-of-its-kind math communication system that allows users in different places to connect online and communicate a mathematical derivation as it is happening, and as easily as if they were in the same room. The primary project deliverable is a minimum viable product to be piloted and vetted through the company?s existing math app.

    diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by improving eye contact. Children with
    Autism Spectrum Disorder do not make eye contact readily and eye contact is a
    key component in progressing social behavior. Current methodologies to assist
    these children in maximizing their capabilities are out of reach for many, costing
    families thousands of dollars a month, requiring 25-40 hours per week and offer
    measureable improvements at less than 47%. This project has shown positive results
    in preliminary testing and is expected to result in an affordable, practical solution
    to the challenges children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their families encounter.
    As their social skills improve, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder will be
    able to build and maintain friendships, become more fully engaged in society,
    prepare them to become self-sustaining adults, and increase their employment opportunities.
    Additionally, this program can also be expanded to children with other disabilities
    or children without disabilities, resulting in increased ability to also build
    and maintain friendships, become more fully engaged in society to prepare them
    to become self-sustaining adults, and increase their employment opportunities.
    Potential customers will include parents, school districts, and other professional
    and nonprofessional caregivers. The high need for this program will create market
    growth, creating new jobs and generating tax revenue. \n\nThe goal for this project
    is to develop a multi-sensory program, developed for smart mobile devices, that
    improves children with Autism Spectrum Disorder?s social skills so they can function
    as their typical peers who do not have Autism Spectrum Disorder. This goal is
    accomplished by developing an interactive program that teaches the social skill,
    making eye contact with individuals the child does and does not know, by improving
    sensory integration and regulating the overactive amygdala. Funding would allow
    for the development of the program to test, measure and quantify sensory integration
    and eye contact improvement for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Analyses
    will reflect the interpretation requirements of a Pre vs. Post, Intervention versus
    Control design. All statistical analyses and tests will be conducted using the
    widely used program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17 or
    higher and will be verified with Statistical Analysis System when appropriate
    or marginal findings."

    to advance the commercialization of an innovative software platform for detailed
    and accurate group discussion of video material. Communication around video is
    a major problem, because the social and content channels are disconnected. Collaboration
    currently happens through email or shared text documents that are separated from
    the relevant segments in the video being discussed. This disconnect hampers in-depth
    communication and leads to errors. This project's focus is to integrate video
    content and collaborative discussion on the same page with multiple annotation
    features so that discussion and collaboration can be as detailed and efficient
    as with a shared text document. The increasing importance and proliferation of
    video in the educational arena and other domains strategically places this project
    at the vanguard of scientific discovery in building a technology tool that will
    serve society. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces
    where videos are used by individuals or groups as part of training, analysis or
    assessment such as corporate/manufacturing, legal/criminal justice, medical and
    others. The project holds a patent and is situated as a spin-out from a university.
    It has unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus
    generating tax revenue and creating jobs.  \n\nThis project focuses on the development
    of a commercial-ready Video Collaboratory platform for team-based learning and

    be responsible for development and testing of technical feasibility aspects of
    the proposed research milestones. For each of the research milestones, the team
    will analyze the data from prototype deployments at the University and from other
    beta testers. Formative evaluation will be conducted through analysis of log files,
    informal interviews and focus groups with beta testers. Based on the feedback,
    a coded prototype will be created and tested on the test server before final deployment

    design, and making at a price point that will be affordable for large numbers
    of elementary school classrooms throughout the nation. Such an educational robotics
    kit benefits society by positively influencing science, technology, engineering,

    manner. These technologies include wireless communications systems now available
    on low-cost touch tablets, as well as powerful, inexpensive microprocessors that
    enable small, custom hardware kits to communicate with such tablets. By combining
    the sensing of environmental values such as light and sound levels with motors,
    lights and other output expressions, this kit will provide a chance for students
    to think at the systems level. They will create interactive sculptural robots
    and connect systems thinking to programming, engineering, and design, all of which
    are lifelong skills for the STEM-focused future. \n\nThis project combines wireless
    communication, tablets, and embedded microcontroller technologies to converge
    on an interactive system for specifying the behavior of a responsive, environmental-sensing
    robot and to then lock the resulting behavior onboard the microcontroller, creating
    a programmable, responsive robot system for education at the lowest cost possible.
    Robot-to-robot communication is effected using mesh networking, enabling sensor
    sharing and synchronization of action across robots in a classroom. A newly designed
    drag-and-drop programming interface on the tablet screen demonstrates the basic
    concepts of feedback control systems and directly programs the embedded microprocessor.
    Uploading of the feedback control system specification directly to the microprocessor,
    in turn, enables autonomous operation of the robot without the need for a dedicated
    programming tablet at all times. This project makes use of participatory design,
    interaction design, hardware architecture, firmware programming, and supply chain
    analysis to arrive at a usable system that can be produced in large quantities
    as appropriate for national and international demand. The participatory design
    portion of this work will include direct, collaborative pilots deployed in local
    schools; professional development opportunities for participating teachers; and
    formative evaluations of hands-on robotic activities, with prototypes, in classrooms.
    This project will lead directly to the commercialization of a bridge product that

    This project will develop a platform that leverages Colytix? existing app and user base to create a transformative technology capable of addressing the massive gap in student retention among community college and part-time students.  College education is seen as one of the primary drivers of economic success for US citizens and therefore directly impacts on the welfare of citizens and the health of the overall economy.  Community colleges received significant attention in 2015 after President Barack Obama proposed to make community college tuition free to many residents of the US in his State of the Union Address. Once implemented, this plan would increase enrollment at community colleges dramatically, but would likely only exacerbate current poor graduation and retention rates if no changes to the status quo are implemented.  This project will provide a key technology to help to realize these goals across the country.

    An innovative combination of technology, interaction design, and educational theory will be used to enable collaboration between students as well as their faculty and mentors. The ultimate goal of the project is to create an individualized platform that breaks each student?s long term goals down into manageable, short term, individualized targets while providing a community of other students and faculty to monitor progress, provide encouragement, and provide timely and appropriate interventions when necessary. This approach will address all of the key factors in low student retention and provide a clear pathway to success for each individual student. The initial focus of the project will be on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in community colleges, but the underlying principles of the platform can be applied to any discipline across any geography and/or institution.

    Research (SBIR) project will be to provide the biotechnology and pharmaceutical

    more effective therapies for obesity and its associated problems, diabetes, heart

    and scaffolds separately to confirm the identity and function; 2) combine the
    human cells with the scaffold and perform assays in vitro to demonstrate that
    they can mimic the function of actual human fat; and 3) transplant the human cell/scaffold
    constructs into mice for 8 weeks to show that the tissue engineered fat pad will
    work under \"real life\" conditions.  It is anticipated that the human cell/scaffold
    constructs will display the metabolic features associated with human fat.  With
    this proof-of-concept data, the next step will be to create tissue engineered
    fat pads that display not only healthy but unhealthy (diabetes, obesity) metabolic
    patterns for use in drug screening and discovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a sustainable, secure, and low-cost supply of established and emerging plant-based medicines. The class of molecules targeted for microbial biosynthesis are the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, a diverse group of plant therapeutics that includes the pain-relieving opioids and the anti-cancer noscapinoids. Approximately 100,000 hectares of opium poppy are grown annually to extract more than 800 tons of opiate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This process diverts land use from food crops and consumes horticultural supplies including water, pesticides, herbicides, and nitrogen- and phosphorus-fertilizers. The existing supply chain suffers further vulnerabilities due to crop susceptibility to climate and disease, restricted growing seasons, and the logistical and security concerns associated with transporting poppy materials across the globe. This project will develop technology to manufacture medicinal opioids and plant-based medicines by yeast fermentation. The technology will allow for year-round, market-responsive production of valuable APIs in secure, local bioreactor facilities. An independent technoeconomic model shows yeast-based production will lower the cost of opiates by 10-50 fold. Furthermore, this technology will provide for diversification into the biosynthesis of rare and novel molecules for drug discovery, with indications spanning cancer, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases.

    This SBIR project proposes to develop baker's yeast as a scalable production system for medicinal opiates and related plant therapeutics. While much effort has been directed to establishing yeast strains that make high levels of other plant-specialized metabolites, such as terpenoids, platform strains for this diverse class of alkaloids do not exist. The key technical hurdle addressed by this project is to engineer strains capable of synthesizing high levels of the common branch point molecule, reticuline, from tyrosine. This project will use synthetic biology tools to improve existing prototype strains by 1) engineering alternative biosynthesis routes to increase pathway flux and bypass bottlenecks, 2) protecting a key unstable building block molecule from degradation by the host cell metabolism, and 3) implementing a spatial engineering approach to promote enzyme access to target substrates. The goal is to generate a platform yeast strain that will be used to target valuable molecules at commercially-relevant titers of greater than 1 g/L. The platform strain also will be used to access previously inaccessible natural benzylisoquinoline molecules, and an even greater number of non-natural derivatives. This technology will broadly transform the approach to provision, discover, and develop needed medicines and drug candidates.
