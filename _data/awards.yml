    to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually
    transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia
    trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings.
    The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care
    (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented
    reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent
    STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct
    annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or
    not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional
    lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit.
    This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to
    loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection
    transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the
    patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture;
    (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient:
    Handheld with no required equipment or training. \n\nThe key innovation of the
    company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively
    pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically
    enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the
    use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was
    able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its
    system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into
    a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully
    develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and
    CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product
    optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness
    studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract
    prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device
    components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing
    processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company
    will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance
    of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas
    for optimization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype of a
    high-throughput, agile, low-cost manufacturing system for tile mosaics. Mosaics have been a source of
    visual splendor for millennia, but they have always required arduous and painstaking hand assembly.
    Our Phase I proved the feasibility of a programmable, high-throughput robotic tile-assembly system to
    enhance the production of mosaic tilings. Phase II R&D will build upon Phase I success to further speed
    up, automate and scale the system, develop an effective agile manufacturing management system, and
    analyze the economic viability of robotic mosaic assembly for Phase III. We will accomplish this by
    enhancing the mechanical processes and reducing operator time - in addition to developing a productionflow
    information system. After Phase II system optimization, we will evaluate the commercial potential
    of the Artaic technology. The anticipated technical result will be providing a 5x faster manufacturing
    process with a 75% reduction in the price per square foot of customizable mosaic tilings produced. The
    intellectual merits of this SBIR project involve Artaic?s disruptive robotic technology, which transforms
    mosaic installation from its current, time-consuming manual labor processes to a rapid, robotically
    directed customizable process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project expands the utilization of artisanal mosaic work
    while increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. manufacturing processes through increased
    automation and customization. Successful development of this technology will enable a breakthrough
    pricing structure that is 75% lower than the competition (based on manual and rudimentary automated
    processes), leading to broad market affordability and widespread commercial adoption. Our robotic
    system has the potential to revolutionize the $76B global tile industry, while creating numerous
    domestic job opportunities. Artaic expects that the 5x increase in manufacturing speed realized during
    Phase I will be maintained in Phase II during manufacturing scale-up without loss of placement
    accuracy. The increased understanding of robotic agile manufacturing-enabled mass customization
    processes will expand the scientific understanding of related robotic processes that utilize highthroughput
    flexible assemblies, such as for medical or pharmaceutical technologies, or for consumer
    products. In addition, classical mosaic techniques will become more accessible as an art form to all
    students, while undergraduate students will increase their understanding of STEM concepts through
    engineering courses utilizing this technology. Artists and designers will find the realization of their
    design work much more practical and affordable as a business enterprise.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase I project is to develop an effective cost saving screening technology
    based on molecular modeling for separating molecules that are identical except
    for geometric differences, that are present in the development of pure orphan
    drugs.  The separation of these molecules from one another is both important and
    challenging, since while one molecular form can have beneficial therapeutic value,
    the other molecular form can at best be benign but often can also be toxic. The
    implementation of this proposed strategy should have a significant impact on the
    rapid development of new medicines especially those being formulated by drug manufacturers
    with limited R&D resources. Ultimately, a successful outcome from this project
    will accelerate drug discovery in pharmaceutical companies and allow for unique
    drug formulations to be available in the market to consumers that are relying
    on them for treatment and to extend their life.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this Phase I research project are to develop a predictive molecular model which
    can guide experimentation in purifying chiral molecules for pharmaceutical companies
    to use in drug formulations. Over the past decade, the efforts in the pharmaceutical
    community have shifted to studying pure chiral drugs rather than racemic mixtures
    due to the discovery that certain enantiomers may have negative implications on
    the human body by causing toxicity or certain defects. Owed to the possibility
    of harmful side effects from racemic mixtures, the commercial focus has turned
    to purifying pharmaceutical drugs to create an enantio-pure chiral product. The
    modeling tools to be built will take advantage of significant proprietary data
    Orochem has developed in the past few years as part of their R&D activities in
    developing new and innovative methods for the separation of racemic mixtures of
    enantiomers. The initial molecular model will demonstrate interaction between
    a Chiral Stationary Phase, mobile phase, and enantiomers known to be resolved
    by the particular system.  The dynamic model will allow examination of conformations
    of the enantiomer within the chiral separation system in a more detailed fashion
    since molecular modeling input parameters include detail on the bond, angle, and
    dihedral energies present in molecules of the racemate. Overall, molecular simulations
    of chromatographic separations will lessen the time of discovery of systems for
    separating these chiral isomers by leading experimental investigation and aiding
    research scientists at pharmaceutical companies to identify suitable chiral stationary
    phases apriori. This will reduce both the cost and time of bringing new drugs
    to market."

    Research Phase II project is to commercialize Pyrochem Catalyst Company's (PCC)
    catalyst materials.   These catalyst materials are unique in that the catalytically
    active metal is atomically dispersed in a rigid crystalline matrix.  This imparts
    unparalleled thermal stability, even at temperatures in excess of 1000°C.  Conventional
    catalysts typically require much higher precious metal loadings (as much as 20
    times) to achieve the same activity as the materials developed in this project
    and at high temperatures those active metals can agglomerate into large clusters
    reducing their performance and the lifetime of the catalyst.  The series of catalysts
    developed in this project are designed in a way that all precious metal is optimally
    utilized and protected.  This includes resistance from sulfur poisoning and the
    accumulation of carbon when operating under severe conditions.  This makes these
    materials ideal for high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming
    for hydrogen generation, autothermal reforming for syngas production, syngas generation
    in oxygen transport membranes (OTM), and exhaust oxidation in automotive catalytic
    convertors.     \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II STTR program are to build
    on the success of the Phase I objectives that developed a low cost and continuous
    catalyst manufacturing method for producing the pyrochlore powders that are the
    basis for the proposed catalyst product.  The method may be equally effective
    for producing other types of mixed metal oxides like perovskites and fluorites.
    In Phase II, PCC will construct and test a scaled-up production platform, following
    the design elements of the proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  The new
    unit will be designed to manufacture proprietary pyrochlore powders at a rate
    with a hundred-fold increase over production rates of the Phase I unit.  The Phase
    II technical efforts also examine a range of catalyst synthesis parameters like
    oxidant gas concentration/composition, temperature distribution in the production
    unit, precursor residence times, synthesis solution chemistry, and optimizing
    heat and mass transport.  Through a subaward, powders produced from the process
    will be characterized and tested for activity by the National Energy Technology
    Labs, Morgantown, WV.  The overall goal of this project is the development of
    a high throughput / high yield manufacturing process that produces high performance
    catalysts for commercial sale."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project results from it improving the accessibility of documents and providing a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to enable routing, categorizing, and understanding of documents. By producing summaries of opportunity documents for business developers, SunDIAL will accelerate pipeline and business development decisions for businesses of all sizes through automatically generated, SaaS-delivered structured summaries. SunDIAL will advance the ability of practical information extraction systems by generating summaries from any text document. Other broader impacts and benefits include furthering the technology to empower individuals to get the gist quickly of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, health insurance policies, complex industry request for proposals, grants and other difficult-to-read documents. A successful outcome will allow users to quickly assess documents through infobox displays, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and review key information before ever opening the document.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will discover unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and hidden patterns in document collections. SunDIAL goes beyond the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Furthermore, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. SunDIAL further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. Linking concepts to a knowledge base provides the additional advantage that the terms can be explicitly mapped to semantic concepts in other ontologies. SunDIAL will lead to advances in knowledge discovery, and advance the methodologies for information retrieval, information extraction, slot filling, and knowledge-base population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

    The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes
    to develop a faster and more accurate optical instrument for studying live cells
    and tissues. The study of live cells has yielded numerous discoveries (e.g. germ
    theory, the Krebs cycle, cell division) and is important for drug discovery and
    disease treatment. Live cells are transparent and need to be observed for long
    periods of time (days, weeks) in their natural state. To make the cells visible
    and measure them quantitatively, current state of the art instruments require
    injecting the cells with staining agents or light emitting fluorophores. Both
    processes are invasive, labor intensive and expensive and long term observations
    of live cells is difficult: staining embalms the cells and the fluorophores fade
    quickly and kill the cells in hours. The Phase I project produced a proof-of-concept
    prototype that provides quantitative imaging of live cells by processing the light
    transmitted through the cells in their natural state. Completion of the Phase
    II objectives will upgrade the Phase I prototype to a commercial grade instrument:
    improve optical design and build a housing enclosure, develop commercial grade
    software and automate the hardware controls and develop task-specific software
    applications to solve particular biological problems. \n\t\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is to enable life scientists with a new and powerful
    instrument for studying live cells. The greatest impact of the commercial instrument
    developed in Phase II project will have is enabling researchers to do science
    better than before, i.e., more accurately, more quantitatively, and more noninvasively.
    The range of breakthroughs enabled by the instrument will likely include: novel
    drug discovery by accurate monitoring of cell response to treatment, fundamental
    studies of cell proliferation and growth, minimally invasive automatic diagnosis
    of cancer biopsies, and fast and accurate blood testing instruments. Scaling up
    the production of the instrument will create new jobs and increase the US dominance
    in the biotechnology area. Due to their full automation, the instruments can also
    operate in areas with limited access to trained personnel and provide the digital
    data necessary for remote diagnosis, such as Medically Underserved Areas/Populations
    in United States."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx optically using a unique approach that is fundamentally different from voltage biased solid electrolyte diffusion technology deployed commercially today. NSF Phase I activities brought to light the shortcomings of existing sensor technology, including slow response time and up to 90% "garbage data" that OEMs and regulatory authorities have to work around. Phase II efforts include improvement of Phase I prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection to ~200 ppm was observed. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to increasingly stringent levels, thus presenting even greater challenges for real-world emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry must deploy after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. With continued success, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a more accurate and much faster detection than current NOx detection techniques thus allowing the internal combustion engine to directly employ detection feedback to enhance emission controls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the prototyping and characterization of an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology not based on oxygen sensor derivatives found in the market today. We will further optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through continued experimentation and testing. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and integrating them into existing OEM packaging will allow us to measure NOx as well as other gases including ammonia (NH3). Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our new method for NOx detection with successful results creating the foundation of a new category of sensors based on this differential detection architecture. Current automotive NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price requirements as used in the industry where such parameters are critical. The Phase II will optimize the optical sensing mechanism, and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a reliable and robust device. Besides NOx and NH3, our "inorganic taste buds" also derive carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon concentration as a byproduct of the measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion emissions control application.

    develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for
    petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market.  This
    project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps
    award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas,
    as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and
    create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop
    low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated
    with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering
    jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for
    handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or
    anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters
    carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and
    grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results
    have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as
    compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound
    levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.\n \nThe core technology to be developed
    further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure
    to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives.
    This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine
    manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels
    of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of
    heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn,
    helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing
    one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input
    for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.
    \ After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this
    bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building
    on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor
    while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization
    column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant
    by the end of this project."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will reduce energy consumption in buildings and automobiles via 'smart' solar control window films. The effects of solar heating are frequently experienced on sunny warm days when the inside temperature of a car can exceed 130°F in minutes. The same solar heating that is such a nuisance in summer is very much desired in winter. The national problem is that buildings consume more than 41% of all energy produced (more than 50% directly for heating, cooling, and lighting) which leads to an estimated 2,236M metric tons of greenhouse gases. Additionally, 80% of buildings that exist today will exist in 20 years, many of which are inefficient and outdated. This necessitates a retrofittable smart solar control film. The consequence of installing smart solar control film is that the sun's warmth can be harnessed when it is needed and reflected away when it is unneeded. Installing these highly transparent films will have significant energy savings in space heating, cooling, and lighting. If smart solar control films are implemented, the Department of Energy estimates as much as 1.0 quadrillion BTUs ($10B in cost savings) can be saved annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on commercializing a family of doped nanoceramic materials that exhibit near-room temperature metal-to-insulator phase transitions. Slight changes to the composition of matter produce remarkably tunable thermochromic transitions over a broad range of temperatures, filling a key technological gap for their deployment as a smart solar control window film. No visible change occurs during the transition from the low-temperature/infrared transparent (insulating-like phase) to the high-temperature/infrared reflective (metal-like phase), and vice versa. The nanomaterials are also of sufficient stability, optical clarity, and compatible with commonly used polymers found in film. Phase II efforts address optimizing the composition of matter for peak performance and developing a unique in-line nanomanufacturing process compatible with scalable production and achieving more precise control. In order for these materials to perform correctly they need to be of the correct elemental composition and be in the form of nanoparticles of the correct size. The films will be optimized and then thoroughly tested in the laboratory and in the field for their performance, stability, optical clarity, and a wide variety of application-specific performance requirements.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable
    method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production
    is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals,
    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise
    marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture
    and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities
    and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale
    algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges
    in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased
    operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities
    will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for
    reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to
    maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus
    design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;
    3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the
    need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder
    to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the
    basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater
    use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The
    target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of
    sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a
    minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

    During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

    This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovations
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to overcome some of the current
    lack of similar devices for screening and monitoring of PAD and will allow greater
    access at lower cost for current and future patients suffering from PAD. Today,
    hospitalization costs for diagnosis and treatment of PAD patients exceed $10,000
    per patient for 8 to 10 million Americans suffering from lower-extremity PAD.
    The current options for PAD diagnosis are too expensive and impractical to monitor
    or diagnose the condition in its early stages before it is too late to initiate
    therapy to reverse or slow progress. Regular screening as well as monitoring of
    PAD after an initial diagnosis by medical professionals has the potential to significantly
    reduce the current cost of managing PAD patients, including prevention of many
    of the 150,000 ischemic amputations performed annually in the US through early
    intervention. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the need for a more practical,
    accessible, user-friendly, and inexpensive technique, for monitoring PAD. The
    proposed our transdermal gasotransmitter sensor employs an innovative, patented
    gas-phase detector to non-invasively provide real-time measure of the target molecule.
    It is anticipated that this approach would provide accurate, cost-effective monitoring
    of onset and severity through monitoring plasma H2S levels, which could also enable
    subsequent therapeutic measures in real-time. During this Phase I study, a prototype
    of a TGS module will be developed and its performance will be demonstrated. Prior
    data and results will be utilized to design and develop a breadboard prototype
    for remote gasotransmitter monitoring. Key technical challenges of developing
    a disposable sensor will be addressed, including size, cost, and ease of use.
    Feasibility will be tested under simulated laboratory conditions with membranes
    and animal skin. Furthermore, the breadboard prototype will be implemented in
    ongoing studies on healthy and diabetic rats. Building on Phase I findings, more
    advanced prototype development and further testing is planned for Phase II efforts."

    Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is as follows.  Commercially, the technology described
    herein has the capability to provide faster, granular, dynamic information about
    safety and security, globally, to firms, universities, governments, and NGOs.
    \ This project uses novel methods to improve Natural Language Processing and Machine
    Learning.  As a result, better geo-parsing of digital sources of news about security
    will result in risk content that can be aggregated, displayed, and analyzed in
    original ways.  This enables security managers at these organizations to better
    understand risk and protect their staff, providing a higher quality of care.  For
    non-governmental organizations (including firms), this enables improved decision-making
    about operations, travel, and investment.  For governments, this enables improved
    physical security resource allocation.  Socially, this project has the potential
    to improve transparency and accountability regarding trends about safety and security,
    by improving the aggregation and visualization of data.  As an example, groups
    of firms and governments in emerging markets can collectively identify previously
    unnoticed patterns of insecurity, in support of public accountability.  \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an innovation over
    the state of the art in the following ways.  First, this project builds on current
    geo-parsing extraction methodologies by adding methodologies unique to the safety
    and security space.  Second, this project uses external data sources for cross
    correlations to improve the \"aboutness\" and granularity of extracted reports.
    \ Third, this project exploits contributions from users at the organizational
    level - as well as individuals.  That is, this project supports the growth of
    an ecosystem in which human users of information also contribute to the quality,
    volume, and timeliness of that information. This contribution is also intended
    to improve the geo-parsing methodologies via machine learning.  The opportunity
    is the improvement of geo-parsing extraction mechanisms.  The research objectives
    are to test the hypotheses that NLP algorithms can exploit patterns unique to
    the safety and security space; that external sources of news can be exploited
    for improved granularity and \"aboutness\" scores; and that user-generated content
    can serve to support an ecosystem of information sharing. The anticipated results
    are that the above innovations will result in usability scoring sufficient for
    the safety and security use case."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be derived from the novel catalyst developed of the project. The project will, if successful, dramatically improve the efficiency and scope of a specific class of industrially significant chemical reactions which are indispensable for the manufacture of many useful products such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and electronics. The improvements, for example, will provide access to newer materials for the production of newer and improved related products to address unmet biological and engineering needs. The catalyst discoveries will also enhance the scientific knowledge base of both fundamental and applied catalysis science.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a collection of novel and improved organometallic catalysts for industrially relevant cross-coupling reactions; and to address current unmet industrial needs for higher catalyst efficiency, selectivity and scope of these reactions. The Phase I research will involve detailed and innovative investigations of the current state-of-the-art catalysts; systematic and iterative design, synthesis, and testing of the new organometallic catalysts; and demonstration of improved performance of the new catalysts in relevant cross-coupling reactions. The catalysis knowledge gained from this Phase I research will enable catalyst design and development efforts in the current project for specific industrial applications. The development and commercialization of a collection of new and improved catalysts in this Phase I project will significantly expand the efficiency and industrial utility of cross- coupling reactions towards creating new products based on this chemistry.

    EPG technology to help solve some of the largest obesity and related health issues
    facing the US while providing a patentable new additive platform for the $600
    billion food industry. With high caloric density foods being the primary cause
    for the obesity epidemic, the facilitation of rapid development of 92% lower calorie
    fat replacers such as EPG will have a powerful impact on the health of a large
    portion of society, reducing health care cost for US citizens and providing a
    positive economic impact for the US. The highest initial impact will be the introduction
    of additive modified EPG fat replacers to the confectionary segment where the
    need for decreased caloric content is greatest due to the absence of compatible
    low-calorie fats. Locally, the development of this technology will result in growth
    of 20 + high technology jobs in South Carolina. During Phase II, Tetramer will
    work with undergraduates and high school students through the NSF Phase II supplemental
    programs, which have trained 25 undergraduate students and 9 high school students
    who have all gone into STEM careers. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research
    project are to provide critically needed additive control technology to allow
    the dramatically reduced caloric intake (up to 92% ) of esterified propoxylated
    glycerol technology (EPG) to be used in many food products that today contain
    high calorie natural fats and oils. During Phase I activities, Tetramer discovered
    that the new EPG approach to mitigating the growing obesity epidemic in the US
    was hampered by the fact that being a new technology EPG processes differently
    than high calorie fats such as palm kernel oil or cocoa butter. This creates a
    manufacturing mismatch for a significant number of the products in the projected
    $2.6 Billion fat replacement market. To date the commercially available additives
    do not work, thus requiring a new additive molecular architecture ?toolbox? to
    optimize the processing variables. Tetramer will use it's synthetic organic chemistry
    and material science expertise to synthesize and optimize additives that will
    allow EPG?s to provide 92% lower calories, while still maintaining the same sensory,
    physical properties and processing efficiency as the natural oils they will replace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

    The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a dramatic increase in the security of modern computer hardware. This project presents a security verification software suite that detects security vulnerabilities in electronic hardware designs. Current state-of-the-art methods for detecting security vulnerabilities in hardware designs are very informal, consisting of security teams searching for these vulnerabilities through manual code review and committee discussion. This has already been shown to be ineffective in obtaining adequate security coverage, with security vulnerabilities remaining undetected and exploitable by malicious entities. With the unprecedented growth in the number of connected devices being developed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the number of security vulnerabilities will increase dramatically. The broader societal impact of this SBIR Phase II project is the increased security of computing systems, leading to more effective management of personal information and increased data privacy. The commercial impact is a unique software offering to semiconductor companies to help detect and prevent security vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise an IoT device. This greatly reduces the resources necessary to achieve high security coverage and eliminates long-term liabilities that can debilitate an entire company.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the technical development of a software suite for verifying security properties of hardware designs. The technology improves on the current methods in semiconductor companies that use manual audits in attempts to find security vulnerabilities in chip designs. It provides a systematic platform for verifying the security properties specified by the security teams on the actual hardware within these companies. This greatly improves the security coverage while reducing the time spent performing security audits. This SBIR Phase II project will develop the features requested directly by customers and perform the essential R&D efforts of the company's underlying information flow analysis technology in order to adequately solve customers' problems. The end result of this Phase II project will be a commercial grade product fit to detect and resolve security issues in modern electronic hardware designs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the $1 billion life science research market that is served mainly by multiplex protein tests.  The research proposed here has tremendous potential as a tool for highly accurate and robust detection of proteins that have been linked to cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, the development of this core technology can be used for research of numerous other diseases.  The product developed during this project has potential applications in the pharmaceutical and contract research organization markets for drug discovery, monitoring therapeutic efficacy, and assisting with clinical studies.  While this Phase II proposal includes the development and commercialization of a DVT panel, the commercial product offering will cover a wider variety of disease-related proteins for research applications (e.g. protein combinations in which academic researchers, contract research organizations, or pharmaceutical companies have interest).

    The proposed project will result in a better, more robust tool for detection of disease-related proteins in patient blood.  The product will be able to measure the amounts of multiple proteins at one time without a problem known as ?antibody crosstalk?, which hinders the quality of results when using other technologies.  Work on this project will involve developing a kit that includes equipment and reagents for an end-user to work with and analyze blood samples for proteins of interest, in this case those involved with cardiovascular disease.  A working prototype device was developed as part of Phase I funding, and Phase II will improve upon the device (increased analysis time and multiplexing) until useful for the analysis of clinical samples.  Patient samples, already collected, banked, and de-identified under IRB approval, will be analyzed in a collaborative effort with researchers at the University of Michigan. Results from Phase II support will include a useful multiplexed protein biomarker immunoassay platform that has been validated using patient blood samples.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve light/heat control into the automobile and enhance user comfort by replacing existing automotive glass with dynamic automotive glass.  Economic and environmental benefits of using dynamic windows in automobiles include increase of miles per gallon by reducing air conditioning load with enhance light/heat management.  Replacing standard automotive sunroof glass with dynamic sunroof glass will increase fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon during summer time.  If all the glass in an automobile is replaced with dynamic glass then the impact will be much larger, resulting in decrease in oil consumption by several millions of barrels per day.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will utilize scalable solution processed techniques to create unique fast switching electrochromic layers. Current dynamic window technologies have not reached their market potential due to their high cost.  Due to technological limitations, current dynamic window products can only be used for sunroof applications as a result there are not being used for side windows, rear glass or windshield.  New class of electrochromic windows based on innovative materials and device designs that achieve fast switching, high contrast and low production costs will enable wide spread adoption of smart windows in a broad range of automobiles. The novel electrochromic layers developed during Phase I research will be improved further and scaled up to commercially significant size prototypes. New smart windows will cost 3-4x lower compared to current smart window products on the market or in advanced development stage.  These novel electrochromic devices will be thoroughly characterized and their long term reliability established by the end of Phase II research. At the end of Phase II prototypes of fast switching electrochromic automotive glazing will be built that are suitable for installation in a car for sunroof and/or side window.

    a new generation of cancer diagnostics that impact patient care.  During this
    Phase II project, the goal is to design and produce the separation device, a fluidic
    workstation, and supply kit; then, evaluate its ability to capture and recover
    CTCs from the blood of cancer patients.  The Phase I data demonstrate the feasibility
    of this approach.  The results of this study will evaluate alternative means of
    capturing and recovering CTCs, with the goal of >90% recovery of cells in a procedure
    requiring 60 minutes or less.  A secondary goal of Phase II is to evaluate the

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project plans to develop an affordable device that will allow the visually handicapped community to access digital information in a robust format comparable to a mobile tablet computer. Current embodiments of this technology use 40 year old technology that cannot scale beyond two lines of text, consume significant amounts of power, and are prohibitively expensive when using more than a single line. This Phase II project will focus on establishing a mechanical Braille cell module using the polymer-based single dot actuator successfully developed in the Phase I project as the foundation for a multiline display. The primary technical challenges to be addressed are achieving the mechanistic and electrical requirements while maintaining low production costs. Thus, this project has three primary objectives that build on the single-dot actuator: (a) construction and testing of 1- and 6-dot prototypes that meet technical requirements, (b) construction of an 8-dot Braille cell and demonstration electronics and software, and (c) assembly of a short line of Braille text to demonstrate the cells perform as expected when arrayed in the anticipated display format. Additionally, PBI has the access to technical facilities and knowledge to successfully perform the Phase II.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the visually handicapped community, 1.3-2 Million individuals, does not have access to an affordable device comparable to a modern a mobile tablet or computer display. This severely limits the ability of this community to access digital information and dramatically impacts literacy levels, STEM-related education, and employment. The currently available piezo-electric technology is prohibitively expensive and cannot display more than 2 lines at once. This makes it unsuitable for use with mathematical equations, images, and other larger-scale digital information. The affordable device developed using this Phase II funding will use a novel polymer technology to display several lines of Braille text at once. In addition to allowing the visually handicapped community to participate more fully in this digital age, the development of this device will change the way complex, multi-line information is disseminated. Braille literature is significantly larger than traditional. For example, the King James Bible weighs 64lbs, takes up 60 inches of shelf space 12 inches x 12 inches and costs $342. This technology is expected to impact multiple industries such as call centers, libraries, digital content providers, STEM, business, print media, and anywhere modern users benefit from digital content.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign.  Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high energy costs, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles.  The proposed technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low energy cost, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles.  Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag and buoyancy.  The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy.  During Phase I, successful prototypes were designed with a separation efficiency of more than 90% of a 1000 ppm emulsion at flow rates of 2500 Liters per minute.  Phase II focuses on the development of a system capable of processing 4 gpm, with fully integrated customized electronics, and testing of the system on real-world emulsions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi- component phase mixtures.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods.   The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables.  Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology behind the use of acoustic radiation force on large volume flow rate. Full numerical models will be created to use in conjunction with experimental results. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences.  This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company.  FloDesign Sonics has a strong history and commitment to integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a computer-aided mosaic
    design and robotic assembly system for automation of a centuries-old manual process. Despite their
    prominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble. Labor-intensive
    methods have stubbornly resisted automation, adding considerable cost and delay to projects. Artaic's
    Phase I research proved feasibility of computer-aided design software to create renderings and digital
    blueprints of artisanal mosaics by introducing a streamlined, procedural workflow for tile layout that
    closely mimicked the workflow of mosaic artists, and did so over 10x faster than manual methods. The
    goal of the Phase II research is to demonstrate the speed, effectiveness, utility, and artistic quality of this mosaic design and robotic assembly system. The key Phase II objectives are to: (1) demonstrate a
    prototype artisanal mosaic design system and; (2) demonstrate a robotic mosaic production system, that
    will be: (3) validated for accuracy, speed, and quality through user assessment, and; (4) evaluated for
    economic and commercial potential. Anticipated technical results will enable a revolutionary
    advancement from manual to automated processes in mosaic design and production, comparable to the
    displacement of film by digital camera technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in art, design, construction, and
    architecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional
    societal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. Artists, designers, and builders
    will have a significantly faster method to produce artisanal mosaics without the high cost and
    time associated with manual design and production. The efficiencies made possible by this proposed
    computer-aided mosaic design and manufacturing system will enable Artaic to expand into the global
    multi-billion dollar tile market and develop a domestic workforce to compete against global
    manufacturers of handcrafted mosaic artwork. Additionally, the computational demands of the rendering
    algorithms developed during Phase II will give impetus to further development of advanced GPUs and
    CPUs -- with companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD providing solutions for increasingly more
    advanced rendering algorithms. Perhaps the most significant societal benefit from the development of
    this technology is its potential to make artisanal mosaic design and production accessible and affordable
    to the general public, and because this research enables any Photoshop artist to become a mosaic artist, it
    also hold significant promise as an educational tool in our nation's schools.

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project will support the development of a powerful
    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality
    of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in
    the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the
    treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent
    arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts
    nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every
    year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease
    and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.)
    add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts
    nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment
    and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by
    2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous
    benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides
    effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going
    about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.\n
    \ \n\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase
    I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor
    to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that
    disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory
    monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The
    current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity
    or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter,
    paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular
    tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical
    to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient
    monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred
    choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion
    and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal
    of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor
    as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features
    include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar,
    disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is in the development of low cost, environmentally-friendly coating materials for corrosion prevention. Corrosion is a significant global issue, resulting in high maintenance and repair costs. Current anti-corrosion coatings need an improvement in effective barrier against water or moisture. As a result, it is imperative to develop improved corrosion resistance coatings, leading to reduced downtime and damage to equipment and important infrastructure. This study aims to achieve the desired level of barrier properties necessary to significantly improve passive protection of the coated surface. These coating material developed will be sustainable and will use low cost clay as fillers to replace expensive Zinc fillers in coating formulations, completely or partially. The developed technology will have the potential to reduce damages due to corrosion in spectrum of industries spanning infrastructure, shipping, food containers, defense, and automobile domains. Primary fillers used will be non-toxic, abundantly available, versatile, low-cost, and easily adaptable with current coating manufacturing protocols, making them commercially viable. Successful completion of project phase I & II will result in advanced manufacturing job creation and reduce corrosion related costs in industry and improve infrastructure lifetime.

    The technical objective of this STTR Phase-I proposal is developing a platform technology for multi- functional low cost epoxy-based nanocomposite coatings for corrosion protection. The innovation in the proposed multi-functional coatings lay in deriving the benefits of various fillers and a combinatorial approach to synergistic harvesting of functionality and robustness. Polymer nanocomposites provide an opportunity to harness the maximum benefits of properties when fillers are uniformly dispersed in the host matrix. The structural integrity of metal and its products is directly dependent on its anti-corrosive properties, which can be enhanced using modified clay as fillers. Passive and active protection against corrosion reaction can be achieved by using transition metal ion modified clay as a filler coupled with dispersion and improved polymer-filler interactions. As part of this STTR Phase-I award we will optimize the formulations such that corrosion resistance and other key properties of coatings are enhanced. The validated corrosion resistance coatings will then be translated towards commercial success by: i) producing and benchmarking novel coating formulations for corrosion resistance, ii) scaling-up the production process, iii) mathematical modeling for recursive design of these coatings. At end of the project we will have a superior low cost multi-functional coating with lower toxic footprint.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans the near-term and many years of future development. Over both phases, this proposal covers research and development (R&D) to create a robot pet companions with the potential to sell millions of units in the U.S. toy industry. The proposal also supports the development of R&D infrastructure that will be a critical component of the expansion in subsequent years to the U.S. pet industry (as a robot companion), which is larger and has less direct competition for robotic entrants. The first-generation robot product, a result of the Phase I project, will support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and robot hobbyists of all ages by facilitating user-friendly modification of its hardware and software as well as the creation of users? own robots and behavioral programs. Given the interactive nature of these modifiable robots, they are likely to have a strong appeal to females, who are underrepresented in STEM fields. The project?s ultimate goal is to develop and market interactive robots that can improve the quality of life for anyone through companionship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop first-generation robot pets that will be ready to place in thousands of customers? hands and to situate the awarded company to grow to deliver millions of sophisticated robot pets across the world, including to the many people who cannot have pets. Towards these outcomes, the following innovations will be pursued in Phase I: a puppeteer platform that wirelessly controls robot characters; specification of a mobile, social robot character through machine learning; perception of robots and their environment; reliable autonomous recharging; and a simple cloud-based infrastructure for gathering usage data and conducting field experiments on versions of robot characters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to develop short term Solar irradiance forecasting, will be to support very large deployment of Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generation capacity, by reducing the cost of mitigating cloud caused fluctuation of SPV electricity generation. This increased SPV system deployment will reduce the amount of base load and peaking generation from greenhouse gas causing, and water consuming fossil fuel generators. Such forecasting will enable development of pre-­&#8208; mitigation strategies instead of post mitigation using electrical storage systems. Prior studies indicate that this will result in the reduction by up to a factor of five, of the input/output requirements of the electrical storage system used in the pre-­&#8208;mitigation scenario, compared to the post mitigation scenario. These benefits will be seen with grid-­&#8208;tied, micro-­&#8208;grid and off-­&#8208;grid SPV systems. This opens commercial opportunities for introducing intelligent sensors and control systems to reduce bulk electrical storage. The technology areas used in this project include sensors, 3D printing, neural network based learning systems, embedded computers and cloud computing. The market sectors that will see a positive impact include all demographics as consumers, and manufacturers of SPV modules and SPV balance of system suppliers.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project  addresses  the  problem  of  mitigating cloud movement induced fluctuation in the output of SPV systems. The research objectives of Phase I are (a) prototype a whole sky imager that provides sufficient circumsolar image discrimination, to drive a neural network based learning system ? this will require  development  of  a  3D-­&#8208;printed  mounting system for a whole sky sensor, and interface to a cloud connected, local single board computer, (b) develop and optimize Image Acquisition, Compositing, Analysis, and Forecasting Algorithms to provide 15-­&#8208;500 second forecasts of Solar irradiance, and (c) deploy imager + software prototypes to evaluate real live sky imagery in multiple locations with different weather patterns, by gathering data to ?train? the neural network. It is anticipated that this evaluation and analysis of prototype performance will continue in subsequent phases, to obtain high confidence results. The anticipated results of the research in Phase I  are (i) refinement of the image capture system to produce ?good? imagery, (ii) development  of procedures  to  tune  neural  network  learning  system  towards  obtaining  high  confidence  forecasts, and (iii) understanding of performance requirements of local single board computer.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are block from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries have the ability to store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 30%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also have commercial upside with the potential to capture a $1.3 billion dollar market. Because of this, this project is expected to generate nearly 20 jobs and $79 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase 1 Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compresses by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). These membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size and size distribution, shape and network structure in order to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface chemistry modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (1 cm2) to commercial size (630 cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 30%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    This SBIR Phase I project involves the development of a turn-key simulation platform to automate electromagnetic design and modeling. This involves the integration of state-of-the-art open-source simulation engines with intelligent control software and cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC). Its three main benefits are to: (1) cut design time by at least 50%, (2) reduce operating costs by an order of magnitude via savings in labor and capital-equipment expenses, and (3) improve device performance, form factor, and energy efficiency by more than 10%. This tool enables the advanced manufacturing of new kinds of photonic and optoelectronic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, biomedicine, photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Its impact is to help propel US manufacturing competitiveness to the forefront of the $180B global photonics industry. This is the next generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools.


    Simpetus will develop an on-demand, pay-per-use, cloud-based photonics simulation platform, built on top of state-of-the-art open-source electromagnetic simulation engines, to automate the design and prototyping of a range of photonic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase I will involve developing a new Python application program interface (API), simulation templates for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), metamaterial split-ring resonators, and other common devices, as well as pre- and post-processing modules to enhance the productivity of our tools. This tool for research and development will be deployed on scalable, high-performance computing (HPC) in the public cloud. Work in Phase I will lay the groundwork for Phase II to develop the first turn-key simulation platform for advanced photonics manufacturing.

    implement a proprietary rare earth extraction process on recycled NdFeB magnets
    at pilot scale to prove commercial production feasibility. By recovering rare
    earth elements (REEs) readily available in waste streams, this effort will help
    create a secondary source of these critical elements, thereby reducing U.S. dependence
    on an unstable, limited supply from China. This will, in turn, lay the groundwork
    necessary for the production of cutting-edge technologies reliant upon these materials
    to return to the U.S.  The Nd and Dy elements which are recovered from this process
    are the critical components that increase the efficiency of electric motors by
    up to 30%. The availability of these resources will also significantly improve
    the vertical integration of manufacturing for national security technologies that
    depend heavily upon REEs, such as guided missile actuators and jet-fighter control
    panels. This project will also impact the electronics recycling sector by creating
    a new, reliable revenue stream for electronics recycling companies.\n \nThe process
    to reclaim REEs from NdFeB magnets is simple and energy-efficient, with a minimal
    environmental footprint. The Phase I SBIR project demonstrated the feasibility
    of developing the process beyond laboratory scale to pilot scale, improved the
    purity of the end product and reduced the amount of waste from processing.  The
    Phase II project will focus on the following objectives: 1) designing a scale
    up strategy and building a pilot scale production plant; 2) optimizing the pilot
    scale production process; 3) maximizing product recovery at pilot scale; 4) designing
    a wastewater treatment and reuse strategy; and 5) minimizing residual contamination
    in the final products.  To achieve these Phase II objectives, we will develop
    process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times
    at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields
    of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage,
    we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with
    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all
    stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products,
    including wastewater and residual metal impurities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to produce a better natural gas treatment membrane that will allow end users to capture the ease of processing and environmental advantages of membrane technology at a substantially reduced price.  Natural gas processing to remove CO2 and other contaminants is the largest industrial gas separation application with an estimated global separation equipment market of approximately $2-3 billion per year. At present, membrane processes have a 10% market share, while amine absorption processes account for the bulk of the market.  Conventional membrane materials are limited by their relatively modest CO2/CH4 selectivity, which offsets their environmental and efficiency advantages. The novel perfluoro polymer membranes developed in this program show enhanced performance when treating gas mixtures at industrial relevant conditions.  Study of these perfluoro polymer membranes will improve scientific understanding of structure/property relationships for a new family of materials.  Most importantly, applied at a commercial scale, these new perfluoro membranes offer the potential to overcome the limitations of prior membranes, and thereby, transform natural gas processing.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to complete the development of novel perfluoropolymer membranes for use in natural gas CO2 removal. During Phase I, membranes with superior CO2/CH4 separation performance compared to commercial membranes were identified in comparative high-pressure mixture tests. In Phase II, the research and development plan is to scale up production of the most promising perfluoro polymer.  An optimized membrane based on this polymer will be made on a roll-to-roll production line and fabricated into membrane modules. These modules will be evaluated in laboratory parametric experiments and validation tested at an operating natural gas field site.  Results from these tests will be used to update an economic evaluation of the perfluoro membranes compared to conventional technology applied to natural gas CO2 removal.  Completion of these technical objectives will bring this advanced membrane technology to the cusp of commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

- abstractText: "This Phase II project will commercialize a big-data analytics-based
    adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning.
    The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time
    learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional
    aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social
    interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning
    outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized
    learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for
    online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose
    to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in
    real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners.
    The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated
    by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate
    data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of
    the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns
    that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  \n\nBig data,
    generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each
    learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed
    methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the
    Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback
    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical
    analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials
    of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection
    of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools
    will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each
    learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of
    an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected
    at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development
    of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery)
    that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven
    feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary
    feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education
    in schools and colleges."

    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps
    students practice, track, and improve their public speaking habits."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate advancement in high-mobility materials.  These materials are being increasingly used in the electronics device industry.  This project's goal is to enable better devices by providing complete data on the effects of manufacturing processes and better enabling their optimization.  Innovative electronic device structures such as faster computer chips, and more powerful RF circuits require development of smaller and smaller devices employing more advanced materials.  The innovation that is being advanced through this Phase II program directly impacts this development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a deployable system to directly measure high-resolution mobility, resistivity, and carrier concentration profiles for high-mobility semiconductor materials.  Current electrical profiling methods provide partial data for these material systems that form the basis of the multi-billion dollar semiconductor logic device and RF/power chip industries.  The objectives of this Phase II program are to further demonstrate a prototype by developing and integrating high-reliability sub-systems to build a beta-level measurement tool with nm-level resolution.  This is expected to reduce the semiconductor wafer area needed to evaluate high-mobility materials, and develop the measurement capability to target all high-mobility materials with potential applications in IC and RF/power industries.

    The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the area of personalized and preventative medicine. The proposed work is aimed at bringing current laboratory-based blood/urine/saliva-tests, to the point-of-care, such as primary/urgent/emergency care facilities, community centers, and for some diseases, retirement homes, and self-testing. Current standard time-to-results, ranging from days or weeks, will be reduced to a few minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine physician visits resulting in early-diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and eventually reduced healthcare costs. This work will result in the development of a portable, low-powered, hand-held device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings, here in the US and internationally, thus supporting improved health management in these under-served communities. This unique technology has the potential to further improve the current standard of care by reliably and reproducibly detecting multiple diseases from the same few drops of blood in a few minutes. Although a single disease, liver cancer, is the initial target, future generations will target diseases ranging from cancers to viral and bacterial infections and can be expanded to environmental and veterinary applications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a proprietary multimodal approach (essentially lab-on-chip) that will translate the entire laboratory based diagnostic testing procedure to a rapid and disposable point of care test. The challenge lies in low sample volume availability (few drops), complex sample type (unprocessed whole-blood), short time-to-results and need for high accuracy and reliability. To address these stringent requirements, a platform technology based on a unique combination of label-free, very high frequency piezoelectric biochips, magnetic nanoparticles, and microfluidics is being developed. During this Phase I, key technology component designs and specifications that are required for the point-of-care detection of Alpha Fetoprotein with performance comparable to the current gold standard centralized laboratory method, i.e. ELISA, will be developed. At the end of this Phase I project, the critical designs of individual cartridge components will be fabricated and tested. These components will serve as critical inputs to the integrated prototyping to be performed in phase II that will result in a portable point of care diagnostic device.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves Web, Mobile and IoT applications, which
    generate significant economic value for society. IoT applications alone will add
    about $2T in economic value over the next 10 years. However, in order to fully
    realize the economic potential, high value applications will need to be created
    and brought to the market at low cost and quickly. This project will develop products
    that will significantly reduce development cost, improve quality, and bring these
    applications to market faster. The proposed project will also have significant
    impact on computer science education. Given the growing interest in programming
    at high school and college levels, the project will produce software tools and
    educational material that students can use to build novel applications without
    needing to learn a wide variety of languages and tools to experiment with different
    mobile and IoT devices. Further, interest in IoT has given rise to the maker movement,
    where low cost software and hardware tools are being used to build smart objects.
    Tools produced by this project will further lower the barrier of entry for the
    maker community. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
    the problem of developing IoT, Mobile and Web applications. Developing these applications
    is extremely challenging because of the differences in device capabilities, platform
    support (iOS vs. Android vs. Windows), and resources (memory, CPU, power). Building
    such applications often has meant rewriting a large percentage of the application
    code using different programming languages, tools, libraries and platform support.
    This has resulted in high development and management costs, inconsistent and poor
    product experience across platforms, and low software quality. This project addresses
    the problem by using a language-driven approach. In this approach, a new language
    is designed specifically to provide abstractions for the various forms of heterogeneity
    (including hardware, capability, resource and abstraction heterogeneities). Compilers
    and code generators use the semantic properties of the abstractions to generate
    code customized for each device. The Phase 1 project will develop tools and libraries
    for targeting the language for several mobile and IoT platforms. The outcome of
    Phase 1 will be a set of tools, which when given a program and a description of
    devices, will generate code for each device, distribute and install the binaries
    on each device, and manage the binaries for the devices."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to protect consumer privacy while continuing
    to enable the ad-supported Internet model. Current tracking-based consumer targeting
    approaches inherently erode consumer privacy, surreptitiously tracking users across
    many different web sites in an effort to gather demographic and behavioral data.
    On the flip side of the coin, marketers need to collect such data to successfully

    has become an essential component of the economics of the internet. Today, this
    delicate balance of competing pros and cons is further threatened by the rise
    of ad-blocking software, which erodes the value of internet ad placement. The
    video marketing analytics capability developed in this project will limit marketers'
    need for invasive consumer data, while improving consumer experience. In the commercial
    realm, marketers would value the opportunity to target their ads in the most emotionally
    consonant, least disruptive, and most engaging manner possible. This technology

    This SBIR Phase I project strives to reduce aircraft wire weight in order to improve aircraft range and reduce operating costs.  Commercial and military aerospace companies are heavily concerned with fuel costs associated with aircraft operation, as this expense contributes significantly to the total costs of the company.  Substantial reductions in aircraft weight could save millions of dollars per plane over its operating lifetime.  For example, eliminating a single pound from a military fighter aircraft can save up to $3,000 over its lifetime, as well as increase its operating range, capacity to carry a larger payload and extend its time-on-station capabilities.  These cost savings will benefit commercial aviation companies from decreased expense, resulting in a higher net income.  Enhanced financial performance promotes company growth and the creation of more jobs throughout all levels of the organization.  Increased income and job growth in this sector with stimulate continued national economic growth, providing benefit to the government via tax collections and increased commercial sector performance.  National defense and aerospace sectors would also benefit from fuel cost reductions reducing costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This project directly aligns with the NSF mission to progress science, advance national prosperity and secure the national defense.


    This project provides innovative contribution to wire development and manufacturing through the use of a carbon nanotube deposition process in order to produce shielding for wires. This process is versatile and can be used to produce cables with a commercial metal inner conductor or a carbon nanotube fiber bundle as inner conductor and a specific conductivity similar to tin. It combines high strength, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity with low density, which makes them ideal for applications where weight reduction is a priority, specifically in aerospace applications.  Until now, only minor reductions in wire weight have been achieved, through advances in composite connectors, thermoplastic cable clamps, downsizing connectors and using thinner wall insulation. The use of carbon nanotubes would remove the need for component removal due to decreased weight. The goal of this project is to prove out a continuous roll-to-roll wire coating process to produce carbon nanotube electromagnetic interference shields suitable for a large volume manufacturing operation. This will be accomplished through the use of foundationary methods of carbon nanotube deposition developed prior to this Phase I project. This project will produce the methods required for developing roll-to-roll continuous carbon nanotube wire coating.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to trigger a major shift toward mobile content across the marketing industry - broadening the market and generating larger economic impact. Massive amounts of media dollars are poised to shift toward mobile video, but will not flow freely until ads can be delivered on the right content (engaging and safe) to the right people (targeted consumer segments) at the right time (when consumers are actively engaged). This SBIR Phase I project will radically advance the scientific and technological understanding needed for marketers to deliver ads this way, thereby enabling them to build their brands with sight, sound, and motion content delivered surgically through the most personal and engaging channel available - mobile. With the project facilitating this transition: 1) brands will be able to advertise more efficiently across TV and mobile media; 2) content producers, now able to extract fair market value for their efforts, will be motivated to create more and better content; and 3) audiences will benefit from improved content quality, selection and accessibility.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to enable brands and agencies to quickly and efficiently extend TV media plans into the rapidly growing mobile video space. While marketers have sophisticated TV planning tools at their disposal, they currently lack the ability to integrate TV/mobile video advertising in a way that optimizes their audience engagement and media spend. The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop social media-based recommendation technology to help marketers plan mobile video ad campaigns that seamlessly integrate with their traditional TV campaigns. The proposed project will 1) validate the technical and commercial feasibility of this approach and 2) produce an alpha version of the technology. Anticipated technical results include: building and testing a video content discovery engine; validating and implementing a planning system; initiating UI testing and user studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in creating a market for financially sustained and accountable water services in developing countries. The impact of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene on public health is significant, and has the potential to prevent at least 9.1% of the global disease burden and 6.3% of all deaths. Present-day approaches for delivering water services in developing countries typically focus on deploying, maintaining, and monitoring aid-projects for only a few years. Impact is nominally evaluated by implementers (non-profit, private and government alike) directly. However, even when a positive impact is measured, the majority of these environmental service and monitoring interventions are short-term, and measurements may be misleading. For example, a multi-decade project apparently increased access to clean water supplies in rural areas from 58% in 1990 to 91% in 2015. Improved services may be realized through preventative and "just in time" maintenance activities, enabled through instrumentation and predictive failure data analysis algorithms. This may, critically, enable zero-interruption in water supply. Intermediate access to water, caused by water point failure, to clean water is known to increase health risks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to develop predicative machine learning algorithms for water point failures derived from cellular reporting electronic sensors installed on rural water infrastructure in developing countries. The innovation proposed for research in this proposal consists of employing an ensemble of robust machine learning classification techniques, using cross-validation methods to tune model parameters and evaluate performance, in order to develop a data-adaptive system capable of predicting failure well enough in advance to allow preventive maintenance, repair or replacement.  Specifically, we will first examine condition based maintenance. Condition based maintenance has several advantages over time based maintenance, especially the ability to allocate limited maintenance resources where they are needed, instead of spreading maintenance resources evenly, including where they may not be needed. Our proposed Phase 1 SBIR focuses on developing predictive algorithms for water point failures using our existing sensor hardware and applied to existing customers. Our success criteria for a Phase 1 SBIR is a predictive algorithm that can accurately identify water points in near-failure.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development
    of a novel, real-time biomedical sensing platform that can revolutionize personal
    health and clinical research. Chronic diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, etc.)
    are the leading causes of death and disability in US. Diabetes alone affects more
    than 29 million people in US, resulting in $245B annual health care cost. Disease
    management requires a long-term and reliable body metabolite monitoring system.
    The proposed wireless sensing technology will address this need by providing low-cost,
    minimally invasive, subdermal sensing of interstitial fluid (ISF) constituents
    using a novel mm-size integrated system utilizing scalable microelectronics fabrication
    technology. The proposed development effort will allow the use of this technology
    to wireless sensing applications in medical research (drugs/diseases) and connected
    or digital health. Currently, diabetes patients rely on painful and discrete fingerstick
    measurements or expensive (>$4k/year) and short-lived (7 days) transcutaneous
    devices for glucose monitoring. A low-cost (<$500/year), pain free, reliable and
    accurate glucose monitor will have a broad commercial impact by providing a solution
    suitable to a diverse set of patients as well as clinicians and researchers. The
    proposed project will result in a truly \"user-independent\" operation of implantable
    glucose sensors, rendering competitive market edge and job creation. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is intended to develop a wireless
    monolithic sensing platform that combines sensing, control, autonomous powering,
    and communication on a single mm-size microchip implant. The extremely small device
    size minimizes foreign body response and results in a stable sensor-tissue, allowing
    for much longer and stable operation compared to current devices. The device utilizes
    wireless operation using industry standard technologies, simplifying system development
    and integration. The sensor is fabricated on the semiconductor platform to form
    a fully integrated system and avoid expensive wiring and packaging. The scalable
    nature of the semiconductor technology enhances manufacturability, reduces unit
    cost in volume production, and ensures the availability of high volume manufacturing.
    Phase-I seeks to develop the integrated sensor solution in a needle-shape form
    and provide appropriate insertion/extraction device as a proof-of-concept to allow
    for a small-scale animal study to characterize the functionality of the system.
    It is also proposed to test the feasibility of achieving performance goals (in-vitro
    MARD, stable in-vivo operation longer than state-of-the-art CGM devices, determination
    of in-vivo MARD) using the proposed system. After successful feasibility phase,
    we will optimize the system performance and move to FDA IDE filing for clinical
    trials needed for commercialization, during Phase II."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and scale-up of a manufacturing
    platform for producing bio-based chemicals for application in lubricants. This
    manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and
    transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation. In
    contrast to the complex mixture of fatty acids currently produced in the oleochemical
    industry, the technology developed in this project will deliver a product stream
    containing simpler mixtures of monounsaturated fatty acids, which will eliminate
    the costly separation cost and be directly used to synthesize cost-efficient high-performance
    lubricants. Due to the improved lubrication performance of these molecules, this
    technology will potentially increase the energy efficiency of industrial and transportation
    machinery. By utilizing biological carbon feedstocks and producing bio-degradable
    products, this technology has the potential to reduce the environment footprint
    of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand
    the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as
    surfactants and polymers. A large commercial potential of this technology has
    been identified in the lubricant market, currently valued at $123B per annum,
    and predicted to grow to $178B per annum in the next 5-years. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project proposes to develop technology that will deliver novel bio-based monounsaturated
    fatty acids that provide new chemical structures allowing innovations in lubricants
    not possible from petroleum-based raw materials. Based on successful development
    of bacterial strains capable of producing enriched monounsaturated fatty acids
    in the Phase I project, the Phase II project will further de-risk the technology
    and scale up the capability to produce sufficient quantities of monounsaturated
    fatty acids to be evaluated by potential customers.  By optimizing and scaling
    up the fermentation process and developing the product extraction procedure, large
    quantity of the first generation product (55% enriched monounsaturated fatty acids)
    will be produced. It will be used to chemically synthesize high-performance lubricants
    (i.e., polyol esters), whose physical-chemical and tribological properties will
    be evaluated and provided to potential customers. In this project, metabolic engineering,
    system biology, and evolutionary strategies will be applied to further improve
    the strains for producing second generation products that are more enriched in
    monounsaturated fatty acids (70-80%) and achieve commercial viable technology
    metrics. The monounsaturated fatty acids are envisioned as platform chemicals
    for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous specialty chemicals that have applications
    in additional markets, such as surfactants and polymers."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the environmental impact of Aluminum production. Global production of aluminum from bauxite ore currently accounts for 1% of global electricity consumption, and 2.5% of CO2 emission. Over the last 15 years global production has doubled, and is expected to continue to increase over the next decades with expanded use in automotive applications. To meet increasing demand while reducing the environmental impact of production requires cost effective means of removing contaminating metals such as iron from aluminum. Commercial application of the technologies investigated here would positively affect the global aluminum industry and reduce its environmental impact. Applied to conventional primary production, the technology can be used to increase the yield from bauxite, or allow kaolinite clays to be used for primary production. The former will reduce the environmental and economic costs of production, while the latter would allow domestic producers to reduce their reliance on imported bauxite. If the technology is applied to primary production using carbothermic reduction, the impacts on the global aluminum industry would be even greater. Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by up to 50%, and electricity consumption reduced by up to 20%.


    The objective of this Phase II SBIR research is to demonstrate a cost effective barrier centrifuge technology to remove contaminating elements from aluminum alloys. In the Phase I research we demonstrated the basic technology using a liquid gallium alloy instead of aluminum. In Phase II, we will fabricate an apparatus for handling liquid aluminum and characterize its purification efficiency and costs to own and operate. Using the barrier centrifuge to purify aluminum in secondary production would reduce the need for dilution by primary aluminum, thereby reducing the demand for the primary aluminum with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption, greenhouse gas production and waste disposal needs from the bauxite refining process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to improve cleaning in the food processing industry by integrating hyper-stable enzymes into cleaning products. Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an imaging flow cytometer to enable high-throughput, precision analysis of biological cells for the drug discovery and biotechnology industries. The goal for this project is to provide order-of-magnitude throughput improvements versus other high content cell analysis technologies, which will ultimately lead to an increase in the efficiency of drug discovery. A high throughput imaging flow cytometer is an ideal solution for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as flow cytometry core facilities, because of the demand for higher throughput cellular analysis. In addition to drug discovery, the imaging capability of this flow cytometer will enable researchers to perform rare cell detection with higher precision than is currently available, and ultimately, in vitro hematology and oncology diagnostics using imaging flow cytometry. Finally, a high throughput flow cytometer with an order of magnitude greater throughput will dramatically reduce the time researchers spend in flow cytometry core facilities, ultimately enabling a general increase in biomedical research productivity.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve the efficiency of drug discovery by introducing a higher throughput, high content screening (HCS) instrument. HCS investigates the effects and associated mechanisms of action of therapeutic compounds by measuring multiple parameters from individual cells, typically using imaging. Although HCS has been highly effective in discovery new drugs, it, unfortunately, has significant throughput limitations. Namely, HCS requires data to be collected at the single cell level versus the population level. Typically, low-throughput readout techniques, such as flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging, are used to collect this data. This project aims to alleviate the speed limitations associated with imaging in drug discovery by introducing a high-throughput imaging flow cytometer capable of performing sub-cellular imaging at the speeds of traditional high throughput screening. The project leverages a high-speed fluorescence imaging modality based on frequency domain multiplexing, which was developed and demonstrated in Phase I, to provide market-leading imaging performance. Expanding this technology into a full flow cytometer by the end of Phase II, the goal is to have a 3-laser, 10-color imaging flow cytometer ready for researchers performing HCS as well as the general biomedical research community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a novel method of manufacturing
    micro sized parts in three-dimensions without layers at high volume.  With no

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to
    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM).  In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array,  it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment.  The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of technology to decouple growth from product formation in microbes used for biomanufacturing.  The goal is to address current limitations in the field of metabolic engineering for the production of high value products. Current approaches must balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and product formation.  Furthermore, advancements at screening scale often do not translate to improvements at commercial scale, resulting in long and costly development timelines.  This project will deploy a novel technology platform - Synthetic Metabolic Valves (SMV) - to demonstrate the dynamic metabolic control of microbial metabolism for the cost superior production bio-based products.  This approach represents a paradigm shift in biochemical engineering. Importantly, this technology enables the standardization of a set of bioprocesses independent of product, greatly simplifying and reducing the costs and risks currently associated with bioprocess R&D.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the potential of the Synthetic Metabolic Valve technology to provide an innovative and disruptive approach to rapidly commercialize bio-based products.  The SMV technology is enabled by inducible enzyme degradation in combination with gene silencing techniques, utilized in a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Unlike traditional approaches, the SMV technology is generalizable to any production pathway, any microbial host, and enables rapid metabolic engineering strategies for the production of a broad diversity of molecules.  Importantly, this technology provides for the generation of robust microbial hosts with unparalleled reproducibility across scale, from micro-well to commercial production. The technology reduces the cost and risk currently associated with production of bio-based products, enabling more rapid and lower-cost product development.  To demonstrate this platform technology, this proposal specifically targets production of malonic acid and derivatives at cost superior metrics.  Success in this program will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology, which can then be applied to the production of numerous renewable chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the creation of commercial viability for 3-D printing unique ceramic structures by transforming 3-D printing of advanced ceramics into mass-production additive manufacturing.  This will be a new capability for the US. The 3-D structures being considered can't be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries. If 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from creation of hundreds of US manufacturing jobs to reduction in CO2 emissions. Commercially viable products that can improve existing markets and enable new markets are realistic expectations. Structures for improved filtration, catalytic production of clean fuels, H2 reformers, emission controls for stationary fuel cells, and CO2 sequestration have been inspired by Other Equipment Manufacturers and are already being jointly developed as a result of Phase I progress. Interestingly, these products and more could be produced from the same product lines just by changing a computer program. This great efficiency of infrastructure is a fortunate trait of additive manufacturing. In short, this project will position Robocasting Enterprises as a US exporter into world-wide markets for economic and societal benefit.

    This project is based on foundational technology called robocasting for 3-D printing ceramic materials.  Robocasting is an additive technique demonstrated to be useful for rapid fabrication of ceramics into advanced lattice structures for enhanced filtration and catalytic performance.  However, robocast products have been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking. The goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing much more commercially viable for ceramics by: (a)  overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting large ceramic parts and; (b) designing and implementing a scaled-up manufacturing line commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries. To achieve these goals; materials, processes, and equipment improvements are required.  Developments will include:  1) material innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 2) processing innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 3) equipment and automation innovations to increase production rates. At the end of Phase II it is anticipated that rapid manufacturing of large (i.e., 5-10 inch) advanced ceramic lattice structures will be demonstrated to be commercially viable and penetration into several markets will be significant.  The technology will be perfectly poised for investment from larger companies and Phase III growth.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to advance the state of knowledge and industrial practice toward cleaner, cheaper, greener steel and stainless steel.  The project will focus on the production of iron, part of a $1.1 trillion annual market worldwide, and ferrochromium, a $2.2 billion worldwide annual market.  Molten oxide electrolysis with an inert anode has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale to produce low-carbon iron and ferroalloys, which are the basis of many high-performance steels.  The current low-carbon metals sell at a premium.  Published cost models show that both the capital and operating cost of MOE will be lower than competing technologies already in the marketplace.  MOE can also reduce the environmental impact of producing these metals, even with today's electricity, and can produce even greater improvements with renewable energy.  In summary, MOE will produce primary metals of higher quality at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact than current methods.

    The objective of this Phase II research project is to develop a cheaper, more energy efficient route to production of important metals including iron and ferrochromium. Economical separation of these metals from their ores by molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is enabled by the recent invention of an inert anode material. The essential next step in understanding the behavior of the new inert anode in MOE is longer-duration testing than was possible in the laboratory cell. This test can only be achieved at a larger scale. The models and testing on surrogate systems in Phase I have shown the way to provide this long-duration testing in Phase II.  These tests will point the way toward industrial-scale production of iron and ferrochromium by MOE.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

    This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    the development of an ultralow-power ultrasonic three-dimensional (3D) rangefinder
    system for mobile gesture recognition. The proposed 3D rangefinder uses an array
    of tiny piezoelectric ultrasound transducers which are built on a silicon wafer
    using microfabrication techniques. Custom electronics are used to control the
    transducers and the system emits sound into the air and receives echoes from objects
    in front of the transducer array. The proposed ultrasonic 3D rangefinder has the
    potential to be small and low-power enough to be left on continuously, giving
    devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable electronic devices a way to
    sense physical objects in the surrounding environment. Based on the smartphone
    market alone, the potential market size for this device is over one billion units
    per year.  Mobile contextual awareness will enable 3D interaction with smartphones
    and tablets, facilitating rich user interfaces for applications such as gaming
    and hands-free control in automobiles. Looking beyond the smartphone and tablet
    market, the proposed rangefinder will feature size and power advantages that will
    permit integration into centimeter-sized devices which are too small to support
    a touchscreen. \n\nDuring Phase II, the major technical goals of this project
    are to transfer the ultrasound transducer manufacturing from a university laboratory
    to a commercial production facility, to develop a custom integrated circuit for
    signal processing, and to develop engineering prototypes. In Phase I, micromachined
    ultrasound transducers having a novel structure designed to improve manufacturability
    were developed and a demonstration prototype was built using signal processing
    algorithms running on a personal computer. In Phase II, the ultrasound transducers
    will be manufactured in a commercial facility for the first time and signal processing
    algorithms will be realized on a custom mixed-signal integrated circuit. A prototype
    package for the transducer and integrated circuit chips will be developed and
    detailed acoustic testing of the packaged prototypes will be conducted."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

    Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the proposed technology touching many aspects of architectural design. The company's cloud-based acoustic simulation service (CBASS) is aimed at architects and acoustical consultants. There are over 105,000 architects, 25,000 architecture students, and 2,000 acoustical consultants in the US. Acoustic simulation is a $450 million market. CBASS will be used to understand a building's acoustics before it is built, reducing the time and money spent on fixing acoustic issues. CBASS will check for acoustic issues in a design and automatically suggest ways of fixing them, allowing architects to be more certain of their designs, and saving on remodeling costs by getting the acoustics right initially. CBASS will also speed up and simplify the process by which architects and acoustical consultants collaborate, leading to reduced costs and better acoustics. The company will offer low-cost subscriptions to students, to help train the next generation of architects to think about acoustics earlier in the design phase. Increased use of acoustic simulation will lead to better sounding spaces for everyone: classrooms that are more conducive to learning, hospitals that more conducive to healing, more enjoyable theaters, and quieter homes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop new ways of using cloud computing to understand and improve the acoustics of buildings. Reliably modeling the behavior of sound waves is a hard problem. Researchers have recently developed an algorithm called Adaptive Rectangular Decomposition (ARD), which can accurately model acoustics. To make it work on complex, real-world data, the company has developed algorithms for running ARD on multiple computers at the same time, in the cloud. In this project the company will develop new algorithms that use acoustic modeling and machine learning to automatically check for compliance with standard acoustic guidelines, identify acoustic issues, and suggest changes and improvements to a design that are likely to improve its acoustics. When running ARD in the cloud, individual computers must keep sending data to each other, slowing down the overall simulation. The company will develop improved ways of managing this data exchange, allowing much faster and more reliable acoustic simulation. To let teams of architects and acoustical consultants collaborate on a project, the company will also develop ways of allowing the same project data and analyses to be accessed and reviewed by multiple people at the same time.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will profoundly improve the economics of solar
    water heating (SWH) systems. Little innovation has occurred in this area since
    the advent of evacuated tube solar thermal collectors in the 1980s. Despite these
    advances the cost of SWH systems is much higher than the cost of fossil fuels
    in the U.S. Thus while there exists a flourishing global market in excess of $20B,
    the market for such systems in the U.S. is virtually nonexistent. The solar thermal
    collector technology under investigation has demonstrated performance in terms
    of efficiency vs. output temperature that is already superior to that of state-of-the-art
    collectors. Economic modeling further indicates that in high volume production
    the collector would be substantially less expensive than commercial products.
    This combination of improved performance and reduced cost has the potential to
    make SWH economically viable in more than 40 states in the U.S. An outcome which
    could provide a solid economic foundation for the revival of a domestic industry,
    and accelerate the proliferation of these systems worldwide. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the performance envelope
    of two solar thermal collector architectures identified during the Phase I effort.
    Current solar thermal collectors exhibit non-economic price/performance metrics
    and are constrained to water heating applications in only a few markets worldwide.
    The first architecture utilizes advection to improve the insulating properties
    of a granular nano-porous medium. The Phase II effort will transition this architecture
    from prototype to the fabrication and characterization of an engineering scale
    collector. It is expected that increasing the size and solar simulator output
    (currently below reference  standard) will increase efficiency significantly.
    Material dopants, heat transfer fluid dynamics, and optical absorber thermal properties
    will be examined computationally and experimentally to further improve performance.
    The second architecture significantly extends the operational range. This effort
    will explore techniques to expand this range including the use of material dopants
    to modify optical characteristics and the development of passive technique for
    concentrating optics. Computer simulations suggest that outputs comparable to
    that of a parabolic trough are possible."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be the development of an alternative, renewable route to fuels and chemicals that is based on biomass that does not compete with the food supply. The process will use underutilized feedstocks such as corn stover and forestry residue to produce fermentable sugars, which can be converted into various raw materials and finished products. The project will add to the scientific understanding of ionic liquid bioprocessing and has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate rural job creation.

    The technical objective of this Phase II research project is to develop an integrated process for converting lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. The process uses ionic liquids that dissolve biomass and afford monomeric sugars at high yields via a reaction that is both simple and fast. What is lacking is an affordable method for separating sugars while recycling the ionic liquid. In Phase I the project demonstrated an efficient strategy for sugar recovery. By the first half of Phase II the goal is to integrate sugar recovery into the process front end. Unit operations taking raw biomass to clean sugars and lignin will be performed in batch open loop in order to close mass balances and set a baseline for further process development. Then, the loop will be closed with the addition of ionic liquid cleaning and drying. By the end of this project, the objective is to demonstrate a stable and high-yielding process, including experimentally validated techno-economic projections showing unprecedentedly low capital and operating costs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project, if successful, could facilitate significant energy and cost savings for olefin manufacturing facilities. In the US, ethylene and propylene are the most commonly produced light olefins with annual production exceeding 25 million tons for ethylene and 16 million tons for propylene. It is estimated that over 120 trillion Btu of energy per year is consumed by the current distillation processes for the separation of ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane mixtures in the United States alone. The proposed work could lead to the development of novel membrane separation technology with the potential for significant energy and cost savings in the production of commodity chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. There is strong commercial market interest in technology that facilitates cost-effective olefin/paraffin separation compared to incumbent technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a robust, cost-effective, olefin/paraffin membrane separation technology with high permeability and selectivity, as well as excellent operating stability. Bettergy has shown in the Phase I program that their unique composite membrane can separate propylene/propane gas mixture with propylene/propane selectivity of ~ 120, and propylene permeance up to 1.5×10-8 mol/m2.s.Pa.  More importantly, the membrane has demonstrated over 1500 hours of stable operation. In the Phase II program, the major focus will be placed on membrane optimization, scale-up process development and commercialization. Once fully developed, this membrane technology could be an attractive alternative to the highly energy-intensive cryogenic distillation process currently used.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project is to help detect whether pharmaceuticals about to be administered to patients have been damaged during shipment or storage by exposure to very cold  temperatures close to or below the freezing temperature of water. Many pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines, lose their potency if exposed to near-freezing conditions. In light of tightening regulations with respect to the temperature-controlled storage and distribution of pharmaceuticals and changing distribution models (increase in direct-to-patient shipments), there is a critical need to demonstrate with greater reliability and in a cost-effective manner whether pharmaceuticals lose their potency due to exposure to harmful temperatures. The result of this SBIR II project will be an indicator that will provide workers along the pharmaceutical supply chain information about whether a pharmaceutical encountered harmful temperatures and the duration of such an encounter. Both harmful temperature and duration of exposure are critical pieces of data required to determine whether a pharmaceutical has been compromised. Technologies do exist that indicate whether an exposure to a harmful temperature has occurred, however, the indication of time of exposure is muddled and difficult to discern. The proposed research in this Phase II SBIR program, if successful, will offer a reliable alternative to costly electronic devices. The benefits of this device include preventing damaged product from reaching patients, helping companies remain in compliance with regulations in a cost-effective manner and reducing pharmaceutical waste.

    This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Phase  II  project  aims  to  develop  Time Temperature Indicators (TTIs) that reliably indicate exposure of pharmaceutical shipments to harmful cold temperatures near the freezing point of water. This technology will be the first chemical-based technology capable of indicating the duration of such exposures. If a harmful exposure occurs, the combination of time and temperature data provided by these indicators can be used by the shipper to evaluate whether a pharmaceutical was truly compromised. As a result, pharmaceuticals that have been truly compromised are discarded and not administered to the patient. The patented indicators utilize a specially formulated polymer hydrogel that undergoes a volume transition from a swollen to a collapsed state upon cooling. The kinetics and the temperature dependence of the transition are highly tunable. The objectives of this Phase II project include refining formulations and synthesis methods to prepare polymer gels with highly reliable swollen-shrunken transitions. These gels will then be incorporated into specially designed housings to obtain TTI prototypes. Simple manual-driven machines will be designed to prepare the TTI prototypes. The performance of these TTIs will be validated: the company will demonstrate that these TTIs meet a minimum quality requirement. Thereafter the project will test the stability of the TTIs by measuring performance after accelerated storage and the proposed TTI prototypes will be subjected to standard transit tests. As the reliability of these indicators is a key product attribute, this project will identify the synthesis and process steps that introduce variability and address them accordingly.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in removing sulfur compounds from various
    fuels such as diesel, gasoline and mixture of refined fuels known as transmix.
    It is critically important to reduce sulfur levels below 10 ppm as the emissions
    from transportation vehicles can cause acid rain and associated undesired effects.
    Sulfur removal from fuels is even more critical for implementation of fuel cell
    technologies due to fuel reformer catalyst poisoning at sulfur levels as low as
    1 ppm or below. Finally, there is a need for sulfur-tolerant catalysts and sulfur
    removal processes in value added chemical production using bio-derived and fossil
    derived fuels. The global market for hydro-desulfurization catalysts in the transportation
    fuel segment is estimated at over $1B and growing fast. The company's proposed
    catalyst could address a market size of $150-200M/yr or more. It may find additional
    applications in commercial markets in ultra-low sulfur diesel, fuel reformer technology
    and sulfur tolerant catalysts. The development of a scalable manufacturing method
    for advanced materials undertaken in this project will contribute to U.S. competitiveness
    and strengthen Cleantech and energy sectors in the state of KY. \n\n\n\nThis project
    addresses the development of high performance catalysts needed for the removal
    of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels. However, sulfur removal at concentrations below
    50 ppm is difficult due to the presence of hetero-cyclic thiophenic species. During
    Phase I, the company developed a catalyst product and demonstrated its performance
    in terms of ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization activity, reducing sulfur levels from
    200 ppm to much lower than 1 ppm in a variety of fuels. Phase II studies will
    allow optimization of the catalysts for hydrodesulfurization activity and mechanical
    properties. Catalysts with bi-functional activity toward aromatics hydrogenation
    and hydrodesulfurization will reduce several process steps, thereby reducing the
    costs involved in hydroprocessing of fuels. Phase II studies will enable development
    of a process for scalable production of nanowires. The fundamental insight from
    the performance can be extended toward designing various high performance catalysts
    using nanowire supports. Some beneficial effects using nanowire supports include
    unique active metal/support interactions; single crystal surfaces for uniform
    morphologies for active metals and their alloys and management of active sites.
    Specifically, in the case of hydrodesulfurization, nanowire supports provided
    an easier diffusion pathway for sulfur transfer to maintain active metal sites
    for desulfurization activity."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the high costs of manufacturing protein therapeutics, or biologics. Biologics are a growing category of therapeutic that can treat a range of diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to ulcerative colitis to Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, producing these highly effective therapeutics is extremely expensive, with most of the cost stemming from the purification of the target protein from a complex mixture. This Phase II project aims to develop a new filter device that makes purifying biologics faster and cheaper. The filter media will increase overall throughput, thereby easing bottleneck steps in the purification process. In addition to decreased manufacturing costs, the expedited purification also increases the overall capacity of the manufacturing line. This high throughput filter device is designed to fit seamlessly into existing purification modules, making it easy for end users to increase production efficiencies.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to dramatically improve the performance of ultrafiltration membranes used in protein separations. Currently existing ultrafiltration membranes suffer from either prohibitively low throughputs or broad pore sizes, limiting their efficacy in separation processes. This project takes advantage of a unique class of polymeric materials, known as block copolymers, to make membranes that overcome the previous structural limitations. Namely, the block copolymer membranes have very high throughputs and very uniform pore sizes. These important features are possible due to the distinct ability of block copolymers to self-assembly into periodic, ordered structures with length scales relevant for protein separations. Using a combination of block copolymer self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation, membranes with targeted pore sizes can be made in scalable way. The research objectives for this project are to increase the porosity of the supporting block copolymer material, attach the block copolymer membrane to a fabric backing, evaluate the performance of assembled membrane sheet stock, and package the sheet stock into a device configuration. Accomplishing these research objectives will result in a mechanically robust, easy to implement membrane material that can increase the rate of protein filtration by 3-10 fold.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project goes well beyond lowering the metallization costs for silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells. In the PV space, the introduction of nickel based metallization pastes can make solar cell modules cheaper and more sustainable. With global demand for energy expected to increase by approximately 40% from its current level of 17 terawatts (TW) to 24 TW by 2035, PV module production must increase from 35 gigawatts (GW) per year in 2013 to >150 GW per year to satisfy a meaningful portion of this new demand. Silver based metallization pastes used in solar cells currently consume 5% of all annual silver production, making large increases in PV production unsustainable in the long-term. In addition, the fundamental mechanism of protecting base metal particles from oxidation at elevated temperatures has far reach implications that can address problems in the integrated circuits and electromagnetic interference shielding industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize nickel (Ni) based metallization pastes as replacements for silver (Ag) metallization pastes on silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells. Silver (Ag) based metallization pastes are used in over 90% of solar cells being manufactured today. However, the high cost of Ag results in the pastes accounting for roughly 7-10% of the cost of the completed silicon solar cell, making alternatives to Ag highly desirable. The spot price of nickel is fifty times less than Ag and orders of magnitude more abundant. Previous attempts to use Ni in metallization pastes have failed due to the rapid oxidation of Ni particles in air when fired at normal processing temperatures for solar cells. This Phase II project will commercialize a technology that protects the Ni particles in the metallization paste from oxidation while allowing the resulting conductive film to remain solderable for connecting cells together in a module. During this project the nickel-based metallization paste will be scaled up and tested on pilot lines of large silicon PV cell makers and show equivalent performance, yield and reliability when compared to standard Ag metallization pastes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in reducing manufacturing costs in the $32 billion touchscreen module market and eliminating use of the rare-earth metal, Indium. Touchscreen modules are used in mobile phones, computers, point-of-sale terminals, and other display products. Existing methods to produce the transparent conducting film in touchscreen modules require many process steps and have low throughput. . By using much higher-speed processes and greatly reducing the number of process steps, this method enables 80% cost reduction in production of touchscreen sensor films. The phase II project will further develop the process to produce patterned sensor films over large areas and integrate with equipment that scales well to manufacturing. Analysis shows that the payback time on capital expenditure for new equipment required by the process will be under one year. Cost reductions enable gross margin increases of 50% and make US-based manufacturing of touchscreen modules feasible.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high speed laser crystallization (HSLC) of printed aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanoparticle layers on glass to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) for the Touch Panel Industry. Sputter deposition of ITO layers for touch panels has been the Industry standard for many years. Sputtered ITO requires costly vacuum systems with slow growth rates during ITO deposition. In addition, touchscreen sensors require expensive patterning using slow and costly photolithography process steps. Indium is a rare-earth material used in multiple large volume markets which has experienced high price volatility. R&D in Phase II will focus on producing patterned AZO films and working prototypes over large areas with a figure of merit higher than industry standard touch films with a projected cost structure lower than what is currently capable in large volume manufacturing . HSLC rapidly converts nanoparticles into crystalline films with superior properties at energy efficient ambient conditions. The advantages of this environmentally benign process include high throughput, high efficiency, high optical transmission, and low cost.  Technical results will also advance printable electronics for other applications and markets.

    with food.  Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low
    since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature.  The chemicals
    are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not

    greenhouse gas accumulation.  These bio-surfactants will initially be used in
    personal care products, such as body washes and shampoos.  However, the surfactant

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the design, development, and testing of a ground-breaking three-dimensional (3D) multifunctional quantitative optical microscopy module with single-molecule sensitivity suitable for live cell studies and nanometer scale sensing. In spite of the current revolution in optical microscopy, commercial solutions to achieve resolution beyond the diffraction limit have been slow to market, lacking in flexibility, and costly. Furthermore, most commercial products are too tailored to the systems being investigated and are difficult to generalize for widespread use. The instrument to be developed is based on an integrated design of the illumination, optics, data collection, and reconstruction algorithms for fluorescence imaging. These techniques enable the determination of the 3D position of emitters with great precision leading to 3D imaging with better resolution and depth of field than competing methods.  Experimental results have consistently shown 3D capability with resolutions below 20 nm, representing one order of magnitude improvement over optical microscopes currently in use at most research institutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses a major opportunity in the expanding microscopy market. The module's unique characteristics and accessible price point will offer multifunctional 3D superresolution imaging capability to thousands of laboratories in the US and worldwide. In an effort to accelerate commercialization, the project seeks to implement a cost-effective, flexible modular subsystem that can be integrated with existing commercial scientific microscopes. With its widespread accessibility, the instrument will impact multiple fields of science and engineering including biophysics, cellular biology, and biomedical science and engineering. From a broader perspective, this project will increase scientific and technical capabilities by providing nanoscale optical imaging for everyday biological research, thereby strengthening the US presence in the worldwide optical microscopy industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a working prototype of a handheld detector for trace explosives that is smaller, more sensitive, and has faster response times than any commercially available portable device today. Under NSF Phase I SBIR funding of this project, Vaporsens, Inc. successfully developed new organic nanofiber sensory materials required to achieve these goals. In Phase II, the company will design and optimize the sensor systems, electronic hardware, firmware and algorithm software required to build a handheld detector. The novel nanofiber sensory materials developed by Vaporsens will enable the proposed detector to simultaneously detect all three important categories of explosives with greater sensitivity, due to detection limits in the parts per trillion range. Prototypes will be subjected to third party testing to validate the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of common explosives. The Phase II project will also permit the design and fabrication of new sensor materials, with the aim of further improving the sensing sensitivity and selectivity of subsequent devices through interface chemistry optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will reduce the impact of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which are a leading cause of casualties in contemporary warfare. IED use outside of warfare is growing, with over 170 incidents reported in the US alone during the first six months of 2013. As a result, the worldwide annual sales for trace explosives detection equipment has grown to approximately $400 million. However, these technologies are limited in their effectiveness. Swabbing machines require contact; bomb-sniffing dogs are expensive, need to work with the same handler, and have limited endurance; and imaging technologies are only practical in checkpoint settings due to size and expense. In contrast, the small size and high sensitivity of the proposed detector will be used for exacting detection of trace amounts of explosives in nearly any location, without swabbing, and at a cost that meets or exceeds the lowest price of detectors on the market. The commercialized device will be the first of its kind to allow local law enforcement and other public safety officials, border security and the military to "sniff" suspicious bags, vehicles, lockers, and people for dangerous explosive threats with immediate results regardless of their location.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a critical need for accurate patient diagnosis in the development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, and in patient treatment.  The high variability of patients selected for dementia clinical trials, including misdiagnosis, has been a significant contributor to the high failure rates of these trials. The diagnostic under development in this grant would provide an important way to reduce misdiagnosis and patient variability. A main objective of Phase II is to expand the glucose metabolism dementia diagnostic developed in Phase I to be capable of analyzing amyloid PET images and structural magnetic resonance images (MRI), and to combine data from one or more of these imaging modalities into an optimal diagnostic and prognostic assessment.  The research will include the development, refinement and testing of: single-modality analysis methods that identify the type of dementia that a patient has, single-modality analysis methods that place the patient along a scale of disease severity,  methods that combine and optimize information from multiple imaging modalities, and automated software to conduct these analyses.  In addition, reports will be further developed and refined with feedback from physicians and pharmaceutical partners to clearly communicate results.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to address a major barrier of patient variability in achieving successful clinical trials, thus increasing the opportunity to find effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias.  More than 6 million persons in the U.S. alone are affected by these dementias, with a societal cost estimated at more than $400 billion.  This population is rapidly growing as the population ages, and the need to effectively identify and treat patients is urgent.  The use of the technology to screen patients for clinical trials and stratify them for analysis is expected to be of immense value to pharmaceutical companies and is an initial commercial opportunity.  Already, the developments of Phase I are in use for projects with two such companies. The ability to accurately diagnose patients will help to address the need to correctly treat these patients.  The project will result in job creation as the initial service model and subsequent product model are implemented.  Finally, by allowing characterization of the subjects in clinical trials, this project will aid in the scientific understanding of the progression of disease and its relationship to symptoms and response to therapy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to them. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two key research objectives: scaling the technology to work for teams of size 10,000+, and determining the feasibility of porting the technology to mobile. A major scalability research area is search. The company envisions the technology to be the primary place where decisions are made, and hence a primary place where knowledge is stored, so fast, full-text search is important, despite the fact that chat generates much more traffic than email. One research area on mobile is the HCI challenge of displaying rich options for conversation navigation on a small mobile screen. The problem is unique to this technology, since having long running, asynchronous conversations means that users do not typically read messages in a strictly chronological fashion. The company anticipates the Phase I grant will enable it to develop a working solution to the search scalability problem, and a working prototype of a performant and productive mobile user experience.

    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture
    allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly
    to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced
    image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning
    accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal
    growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts
    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast
    phantom."

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.

    The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.

    This SBIR Phase II project deals with the development of a gamified educational platform meant to excite and inspire children to learn about the sciences through the medium of cooking. By engaging students with interactive content in K-8 classrooms, after school programs, and special education settings, the proposed innovation aims to simultaneously accomplish three outcomes that are important to K-8 students' education and healthy living. These outcomes include: (1) helping students develop a highly practical skill (cooking), (2) generating excitement about and enhancing learning in several scientific disciplines (particularly nutrition science, STEM, and human geography), and (3) promoting a highly desirable behavior in students (the development of healthy eating habits). This project proposes to develop a prototype version of the innovative educational technology. It builds upon an existing proof-of-concept application that integrates nutrition science (in the form of cooking recipes) with human geography (different countries and cultures) and significantly enhances this application by innovatively linking the cooking-related content to a STEM curriculum and testing the addition of a variety of capabilities meant to increase user engagement and learning through the application. This Phase I proposal will research the feasibility and usability of the product, and investigate the extent to which the proposed technology is able to simultaneously achieve the three stated outcomes in a way that outperforms traditional paper-based school curricula. With the market for mobile learning products valued at $12.2 billion, the company's three-pronged approach to improving learning and health-related outcomes for K-8 students stands to generate significant revenue. The team estimates that the business can reach roughly 2 million in sales in the first three years following the product?s launch.

    The proposed research will explore (1) various ways for the system to automatically link cooking concepts with STEM concepts in a way that enhances learning and engagement and produces a curriculum compliant with Next Generation Science Standards, (2) the application of emotional intelligence to data gathered, such that the technology will track students? mood and food choices, and provide suggestions based on an optimal match between the two, and (3) the use of adaptive learning to effectively deliver the above curriculum in a targeted and personalized manner (including accommodations for children with special needs during Phase II). These outcomes will be achieved by creating and testing new capabilities for the system, including the ability to monitor user performance, a points-based progression system, personalization, customized STEM games, and matching students with recipes and lesson plans based on their culinary preferences and emotional moods, the majority of which will be implemented via the use of machine learning. Overall, the goal of the small business is to develop several different app features that incorporate the above-mentioned approaches, and to determine, through repeated and rigorous classroom testing with K-8 students, which combination of features maximizes the learning and behavioral outcomes that the application is targeting.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to design, build, test, and refine a cartridge of medicine for use with an inkjet printer for printing medicine that was developed with past NSF ERC support for academic research and I-Corps support for market research. Similar to how a conventional inkjet printer deposits small quantities of liquid ink on blank paper, the printer deposits precisely measured quantities of medicine on blank carriers to make the final pharmaceutical product. Due to its smaller size and relatively quick production times, the printer enables and is currently aimed at personalized medicine applications, wherein dosages and other product factors are customized to individual named patients by their medical practitioner and drug products are made for the patient to suit based on such a patient-specific prescription. The detailed development of medicine cartridges has not been attempted before, and is specifically pursued in this SBIR Phase I project to demonstrate cleanliness, address potential counterfeiting concerns, provide ease of use, and provide tracking if required. Such cartridges are envisioned to enhance the impact of printed medicine for personalized medicine applications, thereby improving the level of healthcare for this nation?s ill and creating a high-value just-in-time pharmaceutical production market.

    It is technologically very challenging to adapt the cartridge concept to pharmaceutical applications. These challenges include: the need for the cartridge to maintain cleanliness and integrity during storage and in use; the need to ensure that final products match required composition and dissolution profiles; the need to ensure that the contents of a cartridge are shelf-stable over its life; the prevention of any accidental introduction of impurities or deliberate counterfeiting; and the need to preclude operator error in wrong-substance or wrong-dose dispensing. Further challenges include the need to select and optimize cartridge size and form factors. Preliminary designs for cartridges have been identified, and this SBIR Phase I support will enable such designs to be built, tested and improved. Such cartridges will be filled with both inert materials and with certain specific drug substances identified as being of commercial interest. The cartridge and printer are planned to recognize each other to prevent operator transcription error. Testing for composition and impurities is planned with standard analytical chemistry techniques used in the pharmaceutical sector, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry. The end result is a robust and reliable cartridge, to transform personalized medicine for the better for everyone.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application,
    to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular
    resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks
    are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically,
    elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what
    is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks
    often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate
    mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop
    and test a personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support.
    The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science
    comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce
    content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards on Global
    Climate Change. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge
    more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the general public. Given
    these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM
    professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry. \n\n\nThis project
    will produce an innovative iOS reading app to support science learning.  The key
    innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners.
    This Phase I project has five technical goals: (a) create NGSS-aligned content;
    (b) write and test assessments using item response theory; (c) develop and test
    the back-end for the app, to include cloud-based SQL databases, content delivery
    network, and the application programming interface; (d) develop and test&#8232;the
    front-end for the app, to include the user interface design and the model view
    controller architecture; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers to
    evaluate the usabilityand initial feasibility of SquidBooks. During Phase I, the
    SquidBooks team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation
    to market. The key features of the iOS app create a potential for unnecessary
    memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the
    program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is making scientific
    content more readable and accessible. This requires a balance between using precise
    scientific language and common language, while maintaining core scientific ideas."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is
    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment
    in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration
    should ensue."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be focusing on automatic pairing and provisioning of Internet of Things (IoT) for the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. If installation and setup of IoT devices could be automated and simplified then the MFH industry could roll out Smart Apartments quickly and in large scale. Being able to gather data and insights on buildings could lead to increased revenue from more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. It also gives them the opportunity to create new revenue streams from software and services targeted at the data output. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio. The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs. The potential energy savings of 18M Smart Apartments could be hundred thousand gigawatt hours or $7.3B in savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry. In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The technical challenge that remains for this phase is to ensure that all the devices will easily pair and to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment in a dense, RF noisy environment. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to disrupt hemodialysis delivery for treating end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a significant health burden in the US. Trends are moving toward patient-managed, in-home treatments. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate adoption of safer home hemodialysis therapy through development of continuously operating, wearable hemodialysis systems enabled by ultrathin and highly permeable silicon nanomembranes. Despite the recognized economic, health and quality-of-life benefits of more frequent hemodialysis treatments, adoption of home hemodialysis using present systems is being limited by doctors? and patients? safety concerns. Simpler and safer hemodialysis therapies will require breakthroughs in both device components and form-factors. The development of a small-scale, highly efficient dialysis system enabled by silicon nanomembranes holds potential for increasing adoption of home dialysis and its related benefits for the 430,000 US ESRD patients.

    Phase I results demonstrated feasibility of methods for large area nanomembrane fabrication, strengthened membranes and identified membrane area requirements for a dialysis system embodiment. Phase II objectives focus on completing larger area membrane fabrication, optimization of membrane filtration properties, integration of membranes into dialyzer modules and testing dialysis efficacy of these dialyzer modules in a nephrectimized sheep model.

In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



    Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the potential dollars saved in healthcare costs to environmental protection. The greatest overall savings cannot be judged only in dollars, but in helping to preserve human lives and end diseases and illnesses caused by problems with water. The product will provide unique opportunity to populations to test their water for safety and health benefits, in locations where good water treatment facilities do not exist. The water testing equipment market is divided into low-end, low-cost on-field test equipment (such as nitrate strip) that gives qualitative information about the analytes, and high-end testing devices used in labs (such as mass spectrometer) providing accurate quantitative information. If successful, the sensor technology will bridge the gap by providing low-cost, sensitive, accurate tools for quantitative measurement of analytes. The portable, low-cost, plug and play sensor product will cater to the needs of the water quality monitoring market. The product will also mobilize ?citizen scientist? to partake in environmental data collection and popularize sustainability education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is expected to lead to the development of a multiplexed, low-cost, portable instrument capable of making real time measurements of nitrate and phosphate in water and soil samples. The sensor system for this instrument will be based on the highly selective nitrate and phosphate reducing working electrodes along with reagents contained in the microfluidics to perform real-time sensing without sample preparation. As the concentrations of phosphate in solution are usually small, and since the inorganic phosphate in a water sample is changing due to biological processes, time is often a critical factor in taking measurements of phosphate. Due to these factors, there is a need for sensitive, inexpensive, and portable instruments in order to monitor the eutrophication process effectively. Currently available instruments for making phosphate measurements in the field do not adequately address these needs. Phase I development showed that disposable electrode with microfluidic integration, and smartphone app controlled sensor is capable of detecting nitrate with high sensitivity and specificity. Phase II proposal is focused on commercialization of the nitrate sensor and development of multiplexed sensor platform to detect multiple ions such as nitrate, and phosphate for larger commercial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

    This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be to develop an effective new mosquito control product that works against both adult and immature vectors, drastically reducing the size of the vector population without reliance on conventional insecticides. It will consist of two components: a potent plant-derived attractant to lure adult vector mosquitoes and an insect development disruptor that locks larvae in a permanent state of immaturity, eventually resulting in death, and also renders exposed adults infertile. This product will reduce the impacts of mosquito-borne illnesses around the world, and reduce environmental contamination by cover sprays of hazardous conventional pesticides. This strategy could revolutionize area-wide mosquito control programs: by inducing a large proportion of mosquitoes within the target population to act as their own delivery mechanism for the control agent, the proposed product substantially increases the effective size of the treated area, making it operationally viable to effectively treat every larval habitat and adult resting site, even in urban areas with an overwhelming abundance of potential habitats. Because this product attracts and contaminates all key species of mosquitoes, it will become an invaluable tool for the $16B/yr global vector control market.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I project are designed to demonstrate feasibility of an auto-dissemination strategy to control mosquito populations via three mechanisms: 1) exposure to the formulation containing the disruptor sterilizes adults; 2) larval breeding sites contaminated by the disruptor during adult visits will produce no viable offspring; and 3) the disruptor passed between adults during interactions (mating) increases the proportion of sterile individuals in the population and unproductive larval habitats in the treated area. By manipulating mosquitoes to deliver the control agent to their own offspring and restricting the reproductive capacity of the adult population, this project will help to overcome the long historical prejudice in favor of adult-targeting chemical insecticides by demonstrating that larval-targeted measures can be used to suppress vector populations at reasonable cost, renewing scientific and commercial interest in such alternative strategies. To demonstrate feasibility of this approach, Phase I research will focus on evaluating the effects of the formulation on vector mosquitoes when exposure occurs through contact and/or ingestion; determining the capacity of female mosquitoes to deliver the formulation to larval habitats; and finally, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed auto-dissemination strategy in reducing vector populations in an endemic field setting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the expansion of the range of applications of safe, selective, and effective ribonuclic acid interference (RNAi) triggers for use as pesticides. If successful, this biotechnology will contribute to sustainable food production and enhance biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective pesticides associated with human health costs and harmful impacts to non-target flora and fauna.  The intended first product resulting from this project will be an insecticide to control fire ants.  It is estimated that fire ants cause $7 billion in damages in the U.S. annually.  There are number of products on the market that control fire ants, but few that customers are confident are environmentally benign and completely safe to humans and pets.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize topical RNAi-based pesticides. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, few pests are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to 1) RNAi efficacy 2) cost of RNAi triggers. The outcomes of the proposed research would enable 1) lower the cost of topical RNAi-based pesticides by at least four-fold, 2) extend the range of the target insects, and 3) target Solenopsis Invicta Buren (Red Imported Fire Ant, RIFA). Once effective RNAi triggers have been identified, the process will be scaled up for the Phase II proposal. During Phase II, reaction conditions will be optimized at pilot scale to demonstrate the technology's value for production of RNAi triggers needed for field tests on RIFA.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop an improved permanent magnet that will allow cost reduction and/or vehicle weight reduction in automotive applications. This permanent magnet product will be fabricated from samarium cobalt magnetic particles that are encapsulated with a nanometer scale coating of iron or cobalt metal. Bonded permanent magnets manufactured using these nanostructured powders will have energy products at least 30% greater than samarium cobalt alone. This increase in performance means that the same motor can use 20% less magnetic material resulting in cost savings, weight savings, and reduction in the use of the critical rare earth element samarium. In addition, compact high-performance permanent magnets will help the United States reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emission with no adverse effect on vehicle performance.

    The technical objective in this Phase I research project is to validate the feasibility of achieving a high energy product nanostructured permanent magnet powder by coating commercially available samarium cobalt particles with nanometer-scale shells of iron or cobalt. Nanostructured permanent magnet powders, comprised of micron-size hard magnetic core particles surrounded by nanometer-scale soft magnetic shells, show promise as a replacement for high energy product rare earth permanent magnets. Commercial production of these materials, however, has proved problematic due to the difficulty of handling and coating ultrafine powders while maintaining clean core-shell interfaces. In this Phase I project, magnetic nanostructured powders will be fabricated using powder encapsulation technology has been shown to enable the production of nanometer-scale metallic shell layers on micron-sized metallic core particles in an ultra-clean atmosphere controlled environment. Using these powders, proof-of-concept bonded permanent magnets will be manufactured and evaluated for potential use in simple motors that utilize bonded samarium cobalt or neodymium iron boron magnets. High performance magnetic core-shell powders produced with this particle encapsulation technology will demonstrate the possibility of achieving reduced rare-earth-content high energy product permanent magnets and lay the foundation for commercial-scale production of these materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is two-pronged: removal of metal  contaminants in wastewater to limit regulatory/environmental costs and recovery of economically valuable metals. Water metal contamination is a ubiquitous problem due to the many industrialized processes that drive our economy. Examples include mining drainage, metal plating, semiconductor fabrication, and solar cell production. These examples straddle well-established and emerging industries but each pose significant environmental impact due to metal contamination potential. Furthermore, the loss of the associated metals carries an economic consequence as un-recovered material represents a significant missed opportunity in raw material utilization. The proposed technology in this Phase I project is poised to address these concerns.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to produce a novel metal binding compound and to scale-up the water-metal removal prototypes based upon this compound. The project will develop a production system for producing a small molecule natural product capable of binding metal compounds with high affinity. This compound will be bound to a solid matrix which enables a heterogeneous means of removing metal content from contaminated water samples. Existing small-scale production and water treatment prototypes will be subjected to cellular and process engineering to scale up for water treatment applications. This scaling step is considered crucial to establishing the viability of the overall technology and approach. Metabolic engineering strategies will be utilized to improve cellular production of the metal binding compound. Process engineering will be applied to scale production of the compound and to assess subsequent packed-bed column operations designed to continuously remove metals from water samples. The team will work closely with a local metal plating company to demonstrate the technology with field wastewater samples. Success will result in a scaled prototype for extended application across industries facing metal contamination/loss.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is the development of a process for the sustainable production of high value chemicals (HVCs) from non-food biomass. The resulting HVCs, isoeugenol and ferulate, are the starting materials used in the flavor and fragrance industry for the manufacture of natural vanillin. Today, only a small percentage of the 18,000 metric tons of vanillin used annually is produced from natural sources. The clear majority of vanillin is produced by harsh chemical derivatization of petroleum feedstock. Using the innovative technology developed by Spero Energy, Inc., non-food biomass can be used to produce the starting materials for natural vanillin production. Sustainable manufacturing of natural isoeugenol and ferulate from non-food biomass will serve to advance the US bioeconomy while supplying essential starting materials to the $600 million a year and growing vanillin industry.

    The technical objectives of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to demonstrate the scalability of Spero?s technology for production of natural isoeugenol and ferulate from non-food biomass. Increasing consumer demand for products containing natural flavors and fragrances, and the associated premium prices relative to artificial alternatives, offers a promising venue to advance the US bioeconomy. Spero Energy, Inc. has developed natural and sustainable methods to produce isoeugenol and ferulate, key starting materials for the synthesis of natural vanillin. Vanillin is one of the most widely utilized flavors with a market value of over $600 million per year. Key research objectives include scaling production volumes of ferulate and isoeugenol, followed by a detailed study of purification methods, biochemical conversion to natural vanillin, and validation of the organoleptic properties of the resulting vanillin. This work is anticipated to yield key reaction and purification data which will be analyzed with ASPEN modeling in preparation for pilot scale production in Phase II.

    water treatment process  utilizes the natural power of photosynthetic microorganisms
    (diatoms) and sunlight without the use of hazardous chemicals or non-renewable
    energy to remove contaminants such as silica, calcium, iron, manganese, phosphorus
    and nitrogen from the concentrated waste streams (brines) from advanced water
    reclamation and brackish groundwater desalination facilities.  Additional clean,
    (re)usable water can be obtained from the treated brine quite cost-effectively,
    while reducing the volume of brine by >50% and producing algal biomass as a marketable

    improve the efficiency of water treatment.  This Phase I project will have broader
    impacts on the advancement of science and technology related to environmental
    microbiology, water reuse and water resource management.  The experimental data

    the byproducts of this process including organic matter and algal biomass;  and
    to investigate the scale-up challenges.  The challenges and opportunities include:
    (1) the optimization of the biomass growth and constituent removal, including
    diatom strain screening, (2) impacts of toxic elements, chlorine residuals, salinity,
    pH, temperature, light sources, intensity, and duration, (3) formation and characterization

    challenges are the possible soluble organic byproduct formation and the relatively
    modest silica uptake rate.  Bench- and pilot-scale experiments will be conducted
    to optimize the photobiological process to enable a full-scale application with
    a reasonable footprint.  Careful diatom strain/species selection and more detailed

    This SBIR Phase I project is to develop and demonstrate novel nanotechnology based flow battery that meets demanding 2020 energy density targets for transportation and stationary storage and offers a cheaper, safer and environmentally friendly rechargeable energy-storing fluid, which could ultimately allow using batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in the same fashion as gasoline-powered engines. The proposed innovative approach uses advancements in nanotechnology to merge solid battery chemistries into a convenient flowable format (nanoelectrofuels or NEF). The low cost and high energy density of the proposed flow batteries (up to 350 Wh/L) makes this technology highly competitive with currently used Li-ion batteries (250 Wh/L), while the flowable format enables charging the liquid in one device and use of energy in a separate device, offering new refueling opportunities for EV operations, specifically addressing range anxiety and long charging time - issues currently preventing widespread adoption of EVs. From the commercial perspective the successful development of the proposed low cost high energy density aqueous flow battery could be transformational for electrification of personal and commercial transportation, grid leveling, and integration of renewable energy sources into our individual energy usage for a climate-friendly, environmentally and economically sustainable future.


    In this project novel low-cost, high energy density rechargeable liquids that feature active energy storing materials in pumpable low viscosity aqueous nanosuspension (NEF) will be demonstrated in a full flow cell reactor (Phase I). The challenge of achieving electroactive suspensions with high solid loading and low viscosity is addressed by changing the surface chemistry of nanoparticles and based on the patented surface modification approach which enables high dispersibility of nanoparticles in fluids and their ability to more efficiently transport and store electrical energy. Innovation in flow cell designs are also proposed for effective battery operations with this new energy storage format. Demonstration of this technology in a full flow cell will significantly de-risk further commercialization efforts for this transformational technology and will enable highly versatile, interchangeable and rechargeable liquids for electrical energy storage solutions. The main outcome of this project (Phase II) will be the prototype of NEF flow battery with design geared towards the first market - light electric utility vehicles (EUVs, $1.3 B market in US) that currently use Pb-acid batteries. For the same volume and 25% lower price per kWh the NEF battery offers ~3 times the energy storage and the additional ability of rapid charge replenishment through active material (NEF) replacement.

    Pre-K and Kindergarten students by providing support for neuro-cognitive skills,
    such as executive functioning and reasoning, shown to be critical for school success.
    The first aim is to build a prototype of a game-based assessment tool for these
    skills that can be implemented in classrooms to measure these skills as a baseline
    and to track and measure progress over time. If proven feasible, the prototype
    is expected to assess a child's skills in five neuro-cognitive areas in 10-15
    minutes with minimal adult intervention and provide recommendations for further
    support. Phase I of this project will focus on developing the prototype, testing
    usability and feasibility with Pre-K students and teachers, and collecting data
    to calibrate the tool using factor analysis and item-response theory. The broader
    impact of this research is to gather rich data that will advance the scientific
    community's understanding of cognitive development in relation to multiple factors
    and to increase the ability to evaluate the impact of targeted interventions.
    In addition, commercialization of the proposed tool will help increase teachers'
    and caregivers' awareness of these skills and shift classroom practices towards
    fostering the critical underlying skills for school readiness. \n\nThis project
    will build a prototype using constructs that are based on neuropsychological tasks
    designed to target these skills in lab research. Five skills will be included
    in the prototype: working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, reasoning
    and spatial skills. First, results from a convergent reliability study fielded
    in spring 2016 comparing Pre-K students' performance in these constructs vs. normed
    reference tests will be used to refine and improve the reliability of the constructs.
    Next, the prototype will undergo usability and feasibility testing with Pre-K
    students and teachers. The goal is to optimize the experience such that it can
    be completed in a single 15-minute session with minimal adult intervention. Finally,
    data will be gathered to calibrate the tool using factor analysis and item-response
    theory to refine the test branching algorithms. At the end of Phase I, the prototype
    will be ready for further research to normalize the results nationally."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project comes from addressing a demand in many parts of the world for a scalable technological solution for managers of nature resources to deal with human-animal conflicts and rapid deforestation. Natural resources have large and sometimes surprising ecosystem impact. Even the direct economic value of individual wildlife and forest reserves is often in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Operationally relevant protection technologies that are sustainable can serve as an import tool in effective management. Having a low total cost of ownership and effectively co-existing with conventional human surveillance methods is key to sustainability. We seek to commercialize a protection system that is sustainable as it offers low cost, long lived devices, ease of use and maintenance, robust performance across diverse natural environments, and stealthy operation. It also augments accountability of the guards, and automates tasks such as notifying management and sharing forensic evidence of incidents in settings where communication infrastructure is not readily available.

    The proposed project addresses the challenge with reducing energy consumption for our battery powered, radar device based, mesh network solution for persistent, time-sensitive protection of natural resources. Commercial impact for the proposed system can only be realized if the sensor is low-power, the data driven machine learning based signal processing is low-power, and the wide area networking is low-power. Addressing all these will unlock commercial value, but the impact is limited by the least efficient part of the system. Today the radar's efficiency is the essential bottleneck in system performance; it consumes about 40 milliWatts (mW). Reducing the radar's consumption to 5mW would double, and reducing it to 1mW would at least triple, the time between battery changes. The proposed effort would design, implement, and validate power reduction in the radar subsystem and integrate the result into an overall system. The largest technical risk in the plan is the Radio Frequency subsystem, which will therefore be addressed in Phase I. Phase II will implement power reductions in all the other radar subsystems, integrate the results into a coherent sensor, and integrate that sensor into the overall system. This integration into the larger system will also deal with whole system optimizations.

    This SBIR Phase I project provides student access to computer science curriculum and computational thinking skills to better prepare for college and the workforce. Unfortunately, no organized computer science curriculum is offered in majority of schools in the United States and only 1 out of 4 public high schools in the United States offer even one computer science class.  Educators and administrators need new platforms of community and technical support to overcome these modern challenges and accomplish these critical goals. This project is aimed at the design and development of a web-based software platform to enable educators to confidently teach computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education in classrooms and community centers. The resulting software platform would enable rapid growth of after-school clubs, camps, evening classes, in-school field trips, workshops, and educational gaming. This effort further democratizes the teaching of computer science and engineering concepts, thus addressing the talent gap that is leaving the United States behind in cybersecurity and in the world economy. This project has significant revenue and growth potential as it can be of service to approximately 3 million public school teachers and 50.1 million students who attended public elementary and secondary schools in 2015.

    This project will design and develop a web-based software platform to easily connect, attract, and foster the exchange, co-creation, and delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. Analytics and metrics will be applied and developed to gain insight into the support needed for effective instruction. Instructors will be able to develop rich, dynamic, and engaging content, allowing secondary and elementary students to actively participate with the material and to assess their understanding. Students using the platform will also get access to expert mentors for debugging help, code review, and to ask questions. Educators will able to communicate best practices to ensure continuous access to high quality computer literacy resources. As a result, the platform provides superior pedagogy for secondary and elementary school students learning computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity.  An initial alpha launch, a pilot study and analytical data gathering will be conducted throughout Phase 1 to study the efficacy of the proposed solution. The goal of this research is to verify the system features, the ease of use and to understand if Phase 1 activities result in a prototype that offers technical feasibility to solve the problem.

    fabrication of X-ray focusing devices for high photon energies in the range from
    10 keV to >100 keV, necessary for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and
    structural analyses of materials in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable
    today. Their primary use is in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in
    X-ray microscopes with X-ray tubes sources in specialized industrial and research
    environments. They form a special class of high-value consumables, with a functional
    life time of ~2.5 years, with capabilities to address the global market segment
    worth about $1M today for low and average performance diffractive focusing devices,
    to more than $4M, if the unprecedented performance devices will be developed.
    Availability of such focusing devices will enhance the scientific understanding
    of structure of matter at the nano-scale and the interplay of structure and functionality
    for applications ranging from drugs development to materials science, nano-electronics,
    biosciences, forensics, battery and energy research, investigating terrestrial
    soils or cosmic dust, the kinetics of ultra-fast chemical reactions, advanced
    catalysts, and others. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is twofold.
    First, the innovative method of fabrication is a combination of top-down and bottom-up
    processing. It includes the atomic layer deposition onto batch-fabricated cylindrical
    silicon precursors of sequences of low and high absorption and refractive index
    materials, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers
    according to the Fresnel zone rules, followed by polishing the wafer to form membranes
    with focusing devices embedded into them. Hundreds of zone plates can be produced
    on one wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the method is
    extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which
    enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index kinoforms ? devices with single
    foci and of ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I will address these issues
    by effectively assessing the capabilities for individual key processes and will
    prove the fabrication feasibility, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication
    and testing of prototypes with long runs of atomic layer deposition processes,
    as necessary for functional devices."

    a pair of closely spaced (few centimeters) omnidirectional microphones. This SBIR
    Phase I project seeks to firmly establish the clear superiority of this technology
    over any other existing voice separation technology. The ultimate goal of the
    project is to demonstrate that when the proposed technology is properly optimized
    as a frontend to state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition or state-of-the-art
    automatic speaker recognition, the recognition error rates in noisy multi-voice
    environments are comparable to those obtained in noiseless single-voice environments."

    This Phase I SBIR project is directed at developing  a portable, sensitive, and affordable device to detect M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum samples and simultaneously determine the multidrug resistance profile of the pathogen, all within 3 days of sputum collection (It takes more than 6 weeks using current technology).   By significantly reducing the time to detect viable Mtb and obtain its drug resistance profile in patient specimens, the device being developed promises to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public-health challenges in the world today, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2013. More alarmingly, the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is rapidly increasing, especially in low resource environments.  Being able to detect the presence of low loads of mycobacteria and gaining knowledge about the drug resistance profile of a particular isolate in 3 days will be a game changer in global community?s efforts to combat the spread of TB (esp. MDR TB). It will lead to better outcomes for patients (less mortality, quicker recovery), and also better public health (less transmission to others and less fostering of drug resistance in populations).

    The device being developed incorporates two key technologies that enable it to achieve rapid detection and drug-resistance profiling: (1) super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalized with moieties that bind to bacterial cells, and (2) microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) that is able to detect in real time the growth or death of cells in suspension.  The proposed approach involves (a) using MNPs to collect the ~1000 Mtb cells present in 2-10ml of sputum sample into a small (200ul) of growth medium during the standard decontamination process (b) dispensing the 200ul suspension into 16 microwells, each containing different formulations of freeze-dried growth-media and/or drugs of interest (c) monitoring the cells in each well m-EIS.  The pre-concentration will take <1 hour, and the monitoring of death/growth/stasis will take 3 days. In Phase I, the team will (1) verify the efficacy of the pre-concentration technique,  (2) establish the ability of the m-EIS method to record in real time the death, proliferation, or statis of mycobacteria, and (3) design a prototype cassette containing 16 wells, and fabricating it using 3D-printing (stereolithography).  In addition, a detailed design (electrical, mechanical and fluidic) of the automated system (disposables and nondisposable hardware) to be built in Phase II will be completed, and other applications of the core approach explored.

    This SBIR Phase I project is proposing the development of a new electrochemical method for the manufacture of chemicals of interest to pharmaceutical, agricultural and fine chemical producers. New chemical manufacturing technologies are needed to reduce the environmental costs and the risk posed by traditional chemical manufacturing technologies. Flow technology is reducing the hazard, environmental impact and cost of drug manufacture while at the same time providing an improved product. This project will develop new chemistries designed to operate using flow technology. The development of such new reactions is necessary to realize the full benefit of flow technology. Further, new equipment for the research laboratory is also necessary to speed the development of this advanced manufacturing technology. NSF investment in the development of advance manufacturing technology like this SBIR Phase I project will have widespread impact on the US economy. The technology promises to lower the cost of producing medicines and materials. The point-of-use production of chemicals enabled by this proposal has the potential to eliminate the need to ship, store and handles hazardous materials. The development of advanced chemical manufacturing technologies such as this project will be a strategic advantage to US manufacturers enabling the creation of new high value molecules using the highly efficient technologies such as this project.


    This SBIR Phase I project is aimed at the development of an electrochemically-mediated reaction using flow chemistry as practical, safe and sustainable means of replacing hazardous and environmentally damaging catalysts and reagents in the manufacture of high-value chemicals and materials. Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are of critical importance to the commercial production of medicines and materials. These reactions typically use of highly reactive organometallic reactants in combination with precious metal catalysis to form the bond. This SBIR project is aimed at developing an electrochemical sp2-sp3 bond forming reaction. The project will use the Kolbe electrolysis reaction to generate sp3 radicals which will react with an aryl or vinyl halide in the presence of a nickel catalyst used to activate a sp2-halide bond. Electricity will be used to both oxidize the carboxylates and reduce the nickel catalyst in an electrochemical flow-cell. Developed as a flow process, this method will be readily applicable to commercial scale production. To facilitate development of the reaction the project will also develop an optimal lab-scale electrochemical flow cell. The project goal is to both develop both a more efficient method for sp2-sp3 bond forming and also develop appropriate lab tools to enable other researchers to easily adopt and use the new reaction types.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for the realization of a commercial millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring product that can help neurosurgeons in treating patients with hydrocephalus. While the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of said ICP monitor, the technology can also be translated to the development of 'smart dust', opening up the next generation of computing paradigm. This will mark a significant milestone towards massive-scale realization of internet of things, dramatically accelerating the technology adoption and research impact of millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. The technology adoption can be introduced to multiple markets including, but not limited to, medical, industrial, and consumer spaces. This would open up many new commercial opportunities that were previously limited by energy consumption and size, heralding a new era of computing in an unprecedented form factor and lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for improved treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain's ventricle area, causing head enlargement, epilepsy, and death. The only practical treatment for hydrocephalus is surgical implant of medical shunts, which relieves excess CSF to other parts of the body. The biggest problem with existing shunts is that they lack any embedded monitoring feature. Once the shunt is installed, there is no way to measure the internal pressure outside of hospital settings. The proposed monitor enables a 'smart shunt' solution, which continuously records ICP information inside the shunt for many years. This data is read out wirelessly and can be used to prevent shunt failures and improve the treatment of this lifelong disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

    The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to help protect the environment by replacing existing toxic and environmentally-hazardous corrosion inhibitors used as lubricant additives with more eco-friendly alternatives. Release of lubricants (for example from loss during use, improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental spillage, or off-shore drilling) has the potential to cause damage to the environment. Awareness of the toxic nature of current lubricant additives is a driver to develop new technologies for more environmentally friendly products. This project addresses the development of novel, environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor lubricant additives. Besides the environmental benefits of the new technology, the lubricant industry  may also benefit by expansion into environmentally sensitive market sectors (for example, marine lubricants used on ships) through the use of safer and less toxic additives. The new products also utilize non-petroleum based raw materials from renewable and sustainable resources, thus reducing dependence on petroleum. Apart from being non-toxic and environmentally friendly, the proposed products are also expected to be more effective inhibitors as compared to the products currently used in the market.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to design and develop environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors providing high performance while meeting the eco-toxicological requirements of environmentally acceptable lubricants (EAL), including bio-lubricants. The use of corrosion inhibitors in lubricants is essential to protect metal surfaces. Unfortunately, many commercial corrosion inhibitors present issues with aquatic toxicity, persistence in the environment, and/or bioaccumulation that render them unacceptable for use in EAL or bio-lubricants. Awareness of the eco- toxicological problems of current inhibitors and the implementation of new regulations mandating the use of EAL in certain applications (e.g. marine lubricants) has created an urgent need in the market to replace existing products and the opportunity to develop new technologies for corrosion inhibition. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of corrosion inhibitors for biolubricants; namely (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead products in the laboratory set-up; as identified in Phase I, (c) assessment of eco-toxicological properties using industry standard OECD/ASTM test methods and structure activity relationship (SAR) calculations, and (d) product storage stability testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.

    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear.  The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array.  The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens.  The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers.  Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation.  Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated.  The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in line with the trend in medicine towards a prevention paradigm, following the premise that preventing problems is generally less costly than treating the problem or managing a future deficit. Excessive noise in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has been clearly linked to cognitive deficits among the patients of these care areas. However, isolating the infants from any voice contact is also detrimental to language skill development. This project will investigate and develop a system that will provide for a more stable stay in the NICU, mitigate neurologic complications leading to developmental delays, and lessen the occurrence of hearing loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics? guidelines state that neonatal patients should not be exposed to noises greater than 45dBA yet hospitals struggle to achieve this. Deploying such a noise attenuation system with voice pass through capabilities will help hospitals provide the proper environment for their neonatal populations. Hospital administrators and clinical directors have expressed enthusiasm for this solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop an active noise reduction system for use in an NICU incubator, while allowing a parent's voice to pass through essentially unattenuated. To achieve the noise attenuation, the unwanted noise is monitored outside and inside the incubator and a corresponding signal exactly out of phase with the detected noise is used to largely cancel the unwanted noise. The system will employ a multi-channel hybrid system employing both feedback and feedforward elements. While a more complex approach, this has been shown to have performance advantages over simpler solutions. In this phase, the size of the zone of attenuation will be expanded, the algorithm will be adapted to multiple incubators having differing shapes, and a set of fail-safe provisions will be implemented.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a technology for remediating contaminated  water.  These  new  materials that called controlled release polymer structures  (CRPS) are being developed for In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO). ISCO is an advanced remediation technology that has proven efficacy in reducing groundwater pollution. There are currently 1,322 sites on the EPA's National Priorities List where hazardous contaminants have or are expected to be released into the environment. CRPS serves this large $60 billion market with a low-cost, flexible remediation material. This proprietary technology offsets growing water scarcity and aging infrastructure that leads to compromised water sources. Current ISCO methods require using hazardous liquid oxidizers that pose significant worker safety risk and are not effective in all environments. CRPS can be delivered as a solid designed to treat specific contaminated zones over the course of months to years. It is expected that CRPS can transform the remediation industry by: 1) ensuring worker safety, 2) reducing labor costs, 3) allowing sustained, long  term treatment decreasing  redeployment cost, 3) providing  tunability  to  meet specific site characteristics or toxins, and 4) allowing ISCO to be a more attractive remediation approach due to increased ease of use.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to  support  scale-up  manufacturing  and efficacy testing in preparation for field-testing at a contaminated groundwater  site.  This  program  will develop and optimize material formulation including active ingredient loading, stability, and handling / transport for commercial use. Likewise, methods amendable to large-scale manufacturing will be investigated as well as performance testing in dynamic flow contaminated water studies. Work  will investigate the ability of CRPS to be tuned for controlled release rates under multiple environmental simulations to determine contaminant degradation such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). MTBE is used as a fuel additive and is a common groundwater  contaminant  that  results  from  leaking  underground storage tanks. MTBE is particularly problematic due to its solubility and mobility in water as well as environmental persistence. Contaminant degradation by CRPS will be tested  over  a  range  of concentrations to yield dose response curves. Collectively, this Phase I program will result in a clear understanding of CRPS performance guiding future pilot scale field studies. Cost  and  deployment strategies of the CRPS compared to current ISCO remediation technologies will be evaluated in preparation for commercialization

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to understand how conductivity in the brain is affected by anatomical variability between patients and, more importantly, to enable precise treatment of neurological diseases using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques. A number of studies have shown these techniques may be used, cost-effectively, to improve learning, working memory, as well as relieve chronic pain and the symptoms of depression, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia. However, current understanding of electromagnetic (EM) characteristics for the human head and state-of-the-art TMS and tDCS techniques suffer from the inability to precisely control the most appropriate excitation pathways in the brain to support a specified clinical objective. This can result in unexpected and sometimes ineffective or even detrimental outcomes. Models and TMS/tDCS treatment systems for implementation of excitation techniques are not validated to standards.  A thorough understanding of pathways and development of validated mimics and phantom structures will enable development and clinical implementation of precisely controlled analytical models and protocols for effective, widely accessible, reliable and safe TMS/tDCS treatments.

    The proposed project will address gaps in current knowledge of intracranial electromagnetic characteristics and materials performance to develop reproducible head phantoms for clinical implementation of more precise, quantifiable tDCS and TMS techniques. This research will characterize solid, liquid and gel materials selected to comply with biomedical and commercialization criteria. Analyses will be used to develop formulations of combinations of materials that address the range of conductivity and anisotropy of the parts and interfaces of the human brain. These formulations will be experimentally evaluated and refined for producibility and accuracy.  This will provide a database of materials solutions which will be used in Phase II and beyond.  Traditional brain conductivity mimics are simple spherical shells consisting of a single agar based conductivity mimic, which lacks the complexity of the human brain. The challenges of developing an EM brain phantom include fabrication of the various materials for controlled and reproducible anisotropic conductivity values, shaping these materials to mimic anatomical features, and combining them to represent boundary interfaces and control gaps for accurate pathway performance. The proposed effort includes development of a shell mimic that incorporates applicable material formulations to validate extensibility to more sophisticated prototype phantoms during Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the ability of forensic scientists to capture, analyze, and search fingerprint impression evidence in the field. Additionally, a contactless device will eliminate the potential for alteration, loss of detail, or destruction of the fingerprint impression. This system will also have a positive impact on law enforcement agencies by accelerating fingerprint recovery, improving the quality of fingerprint impression evidence collected at crime scenes, reducing training requirements, and accelerating investigations. Furthermore, this project will address numerous concerns and recommendations regarding fingerprints and forensics published in the National Research Council's (NRC) 2009 Report, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel device capable of digitally acquiring the various types of fingerprint impressions found at crime scenes - latent, patent, and plastic. Fingerprints represent one of the most important and fragile types of evidence. However, manually processing crime scenes for fingerprint impressions requires trained technicians, a variety of supplies, and a significant amount of time. Once visualized and processed, fingerprint impressions must undergo a multitude of steps in order to be digitized for searching against databases of exemplar fingerprint records. The goal of Phase I is to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of utilizing a contactless, three-dimensional (3D) scanning device to acquire different types of fingerprint impressions deposited on a variety of surfaces and convert them into two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints that are consistent and compatible with existing fingerprint databases and matching algorithms. To achieve these goals, the research team will build a prototype 3D scanner, develop new unrolling and segmentation algorithms, and test the ability to match recovered fingerprints against a database of exemplar fingerprint records.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this small business innovative research (SBIR) Phase I Project is the further commercialization of the highly efficient and unique technology organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). This panel technology has the potential to strongly impact the automotive industry by replacing the current tail light technology. The benefits offered by OLED taillights include low cost manufacturing, space and weight saving, reduction in material consumption, energy efficiency, and freedom of form factors for design.  The broader impacts of this technology coming to the commercial market are, reduced environment impact in the automotive industry and the furthering of OLED panel technology. This innovation offers a future potential to be used in residential general-purpose lighting. The demonstration and adoption of this technology in the lighting market can lead to a large national or global reduction in energy demand.

    This Small Business innovation research (SBIR) Phase I Project contains intellectual merit across chemistry, materials science, optics, semiconductor physics, and device engineering. In their initial phases traditional light emitting diodes (LEDs) were very efficient and converting energy into light, but it was a very difficult task to extract the light from the device for illumination. Once this problem was solved LEDs took on the well-known dome shape and immediately gained commercial traction. Currently organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer a similar issue. OLEDs are very efficient at converting energy into light; however, much of the light is trapped within the device and is unable to be used for illumination. The research targets this issue with microcavity structures in hopes of creating a solution to OLEDs, allowing them to become widely available in the commercial market.

    students to create concepts, build models, simulate and analyze, export files
    for physical prototyping (3-D printing, cutting, or machining), and integrate
    with testing. Through these base of operations, this project will provide what
    other engineering curricula cannot - powerful tools for student evaluation, instructional
    assistance, and performance tracking. This project will apply real engineering
    tools to supports common challenges that appear in engineering curricula (for
    example, bridges, CO2 cars, and robotics).  Using the commercially available engines,
    user experience frameworks, and custom engineering tools, the team will create
    a gamified design environment with parametric geometry creation, modeling, analysis
    synthesis, simulation and multi-player collaboration capabilities. In Phase I,
    the project will be used and evaluated within several 5th-6th grade classrooms
    and a week long summer camp.  Supporting curricular materials will be developed
    in collaboration with our STTR partner institution.  The goal at the end of this
    project is the release of baseline product for commercialization that contains
    two different design project modules complete with software, curricular support
    materials, and evaluation data."

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project relate to the increased viability of indigo as an agricultural crop competing with synthetically manufactured indigo dye.  Indigo was among the major global cash crops of the 18th and 19th centuries and accounted for 100% of the indigo dye consumed in the world.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, nearly 100% of the indigo dye consumed in the world has been synthetically manufactured from petroleum derivatives and hazardous and toxic chemicals.  A small amount of plant-derived indigo dye is produced throughout the world using traditional artisan methods largely unchanged for centuries, but this supply is highly variable in purity and consistency and is far from cost competitive with synthetically manufactured indigo dye.  Stony Creek Colors in cooperation with the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center seeks through this project to improve the available indigo planting stock by creating a high-throughput handheld assay device capable of rapid measurements of the chemical precursors for indigo which exist naturally in the plant leaves.  During this process the team will also improve the understanding of the genetics of the existing indigo planting stock through DNA analysis of specific high-yielding plant varieties.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop new tools, both genomic and phenomic, for analyzing the indigo crop Persicaria tinctoria, to produce an improved bio-based specialty chemical derived from renewable, abundant plant-material. The STTR project will map existing genetic resources while developing a unique approach for plant indican (indigo precursor) analysis which will enable non-destructive analysis of plant leaves in breeding lines.  Finally, a genetic mapping population between high and low indican-producing parent plants will be constructed for analysis and laboratory validation.  Successful completion of the Phase I tasks tied to these objectives will prove the feasibility of selecting and maintaining high indigotin yielding strains of P. tinctoria.  These improvements will be commercialized through higher indigotin yielding breeders seed stock and will be spread to over 26,000 acres of cropland in the Southeast US within 6 years, resulting in a more reliable and cost-competitive bio-based indigo dye extracted from U.S. grown plant material.  This will allow plant-derived indigo to be more cost-competitive with synthetic indigo dye and to meet the immediate market demand for U.S. bio-based indigo by denim mills.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to reduce the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. Its patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations based on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if you captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is based on a proof-of-concept demonstrating that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, the project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military applications that would help secure the national defense.

    The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) alpha device. A meaningful-scale alpha device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.

    This Phase I SBIR project proposes to research and develop a fully pen-centric software application for tablet devices which has the potential to become a groundbreaking component of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Teachers and students are rapidly gaining access to mobile tablet devices with touch sensitive screens and educators are quickly adopting one-to-one (1:1), online, blended and distance learning environments wherein teachers and students have mobile tablet devices. The research and development of Phase I will create a new application providing online collaborative math (OCM) for use on networked tablet computers. OCM brings the power of co-located persons working side-by-side and collaborating with paper and pencil to distributed online environments with students writing on tablets.  OCM enriches the static paper-and-pencil experience with powerful handwriting and gesture-driven math functionality for computation, graphing, and interactive illustrations enabling rich online collaboration. OCM has the potential to evolve into a robust commercial application suitable for worldwide use by teachers and students for the teaching and learning of math and science.

    OCM provides a high degree of interaction using handwritten math notation on tablet computers. Increased interaction in distance learning is associated with improved achievement and student satisfaction. The development of OCM is both an art and a science. The art involves making OCM feel like a true collaboration. The science involves developing the technology to create the feel of true collaboration. OCM enables two or more persons to create documents for their collaborative use in teaching and learning STEM subjects. OCM will provide an innovative mechanism to synchronize document state among multiple editors in real-time with minimal or no loss of data/information due to edit conflicts, thereby producing the feel of true collaboration.  OCM represents over 10 years of research and development in the field of pen-centric math expression recognition and is presently covered by three patents pending. The goal of Phase I is to build a prototype OCM application and test its feasibility and efficacy in a computer simulated teaching environment. Ultimately, OCM will have a broad impact on the worldwide use of tablet computers in online, distance, and blended learning environments.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase I project would be commercialization of a surfactant (acyl ethanolamine)
    made from renewable raw materials, which do not compete with food sources. Surfactants
    are the bubbly components of cleaning products that give them their cleansing
    power.  Surfactants are manufactured from petroleum or from seed oils, such as
    palm oil.  The use of those raw materials increases greenhouse gas pollution and
    contributes to deforestation of rainforests.  Society is demanding environmentally
    sustainable (greener) products with reduction or removal of toxicity.  The demand
    for greener chemicals creates an opportunity to replace today's surfactants with
    greener alternatives. The surfactant chemicals produced in this project are inherently
    safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not used, and the
    surfactants are biodegradable and produced from renewable raw materials such as
    sugars, and as a result do not contribute to increased greenhouse gas accumulation.
    \ The acyl ethanolamine surfactant is designed to replace current commercial surfactants,
    which are contaminated, during the current manufacturing process, with the carcinogen
    1,4 dioxane.  The surfactant produced by the effort described here will not contain
    any 1,4 dioxane.  Successful completion of this project will demonstrate a new
    technology for the production of nonionic surfactants.  This is significant since
    nonionic surfactants represent about 40% of the $30 billion surfactant market.
    \n\nThe technical objective of this Phase I research project is to construct a
    Bacillus strain that produces an acyl amino alcohol surfactant, namely, acyl ethanolamine.
    \ Certain naturally existing peptide synthetase enzymes catalyze the linkage of
    particular amino acids to other particular amino acids.  In addition, certain
    peptide synthetase enzymes catalyze the linkage of particular fatty acids to particular
    amino acids.  Past work demonstrated that this system can be engineered to catalyze
    the creation of unique molecules, such as acyl glycinate (fatty acid linked to
    glycine).  During enzymatic synthesis of acyl glycinate, glycine is covalently
    attached to the synthetase via a thioester bond.  Product release is catalyzed
    by a thioesterse domain.  Release by a thioesterase results in production of fatty
    acid linked to the amino acid glycine.  Certain naturally occurring peptide synthetase
    enzymes use reductase domains to release products.  We hypothesize that release
    of acyl glycine via a reductase domain will result in the synthesis of acyl ethanolamine,
    rather than acyl glycine.  The objective of this Phase I project is to create
    a chimeric peptide synthetase enzyme that converts acyl glycine into acyl ethanolamine
    during the process of release of the product from the enzyme."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be a reduction in human exposure to harmful chemicals, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced volumes of solid waste for biodegradable foam plastic products. This project describes a project to develop biodegradable plastic cups and other products using a sandwich process that includes a foam core. The strength provided by the sandwich structure is designed to allow weight reduction which reduces the environmental impact. Grow Plastics? technology replaces petroleum-based polymers with reduced amounts of plant-based polymers.  The plant-based polymers used in Grow Plastic's process contain no harmful chemicals to leach into humans and the environment and generate as little as 1/3 the CO2 emissions per pound used.  Grow Plastic's technology enables the replacement of petroleum based plastics with as little as 1/3 the plant-based plastic, reducing solid waste by up to 67% by weight, and CO2 emissions from raw materials by as much as 90%.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to increase the service temperature of foam plastic products to at least 95 Celsius, while maintaining polymer densities below 0.1 grams/cubic centimeter.  In polymer products, the weight of plastic used is a key driver in product cost.  This Phase I research project, a partnership between Grow Plastics and Western Washington University, will use polymer blending, solid state foaming and polymer crystallization in order to generate samples for evaluation.  Samples will be evaluated in terms of thermal performance through dynamic mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and evaluation of product rigidity for final products.  The research project will seek to develop extremely lightweight products with service temperatures of at least 95 Celsius.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability of this technology to impact how every battery is made, tested, managed, and re-used in the near future. Batteries are ubiquitous, and their use is likely to increase in the future. As such, there is a growing need for low-cost, accurate methods for monitoring the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH) in real time to optimize performance and maximize lifetime. The technology that will be developed in this project will use ultrasound to noninvasively probe batteries and provide physical insights into SOC and SOH, and will work on any closed battery regardless of chemistry and form factor. Initial finding of this hypothesis have already been demonstrated and published. This is an unexplored area and presents a large commercial opportunity in each sector of the battery industry, including diagnostics, quality assurance, active cycling control, and the emerging second-life markets. Several advantages include sensitivity to subtle physical changes within cells, the ability to probe lab and commercial scale cells, and sub-millisecond readings. From battery R&D, to manufacturing, to management systems, ultrasound for batteries will help enable the efficient generation, storage, and use of energy worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of this technology leading to the first commercial ultrasonic battery analysis unit. The feasibility of 1) miniaturized pulser-receivers with pulsing and switching speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than commercial units, and 2) miniaturized transducers that can transmit and receive high quality signals will be demonstrated. This would enable the detection of high-rate phenomena and the use of multiplexed systems. 3) The use of fast data analysis algorithms for real-time SOC prediction using acoustics as the main input will also be addressed. These objectives are necessary for demonstrating the applicability of ultrasonic analysis to the battery R&D, manufacturing, and second life markets. The success of Phase I of this project will lead to the development of micron-scale sensors for incorporation in battery management systems. In Phase II, algorithms for SOH prediction and cycling control based on acoustic data will be developed, as well as investigation of the design and fabrication of microelectronic transducers will be performed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of a high speed and reliable wireless technology that will enable telecommunications and wireless network operators to keep up with society?s bandwidth and information needs. The tremendous growth of multimedia users and Internet traffic has placed a significant strain on existing communication networks. Over three billion people are connected to the Internet globally and the explosion of mobile devices will continue to accelerate the worldwide growth of Internet connectivity. Mobile network operators and other commercial and government entities with large transmission requirements for backhaul and access network applications need low cost and reliable high speed data transmission solutions. Whereas fiber is the preferred solution, it is often not practical and sometimes even impossible to install. The proposed technology will provide an ultra-high capacity wireless communications solution for advanced and developing countries that will provide an unprecedented combination of bandwidth and range to meet the next generation?s service needs of carriers, enterprises and government agencies around the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a commercial Free Space Optical (FSO) communications system that provides multi-Terabit per second data transmission capacity over long ranges. Specifically, the team will build on its numerous refereed publications for combining Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Polarization Division Multiplexing (PDM), and Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) multiplexing to address the technical hurdles that must be overcome to transform the scientific results into a commercial product for the wireless communications industry. Leveraging both experiments and simulation, the team will demonstrate how to achieve real-time performance within a price point and form factor suitable for a commercial product. With the successful completion of Phase I, the team will lay the foundation for Phase II by significantly advancing the readiness of the proposed technology and strengthening and validating its commercial position.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the CPU. Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are often used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. This is not sustainable from both an economical and an environmental standpoint, due to the power consumption involved and the lack of performance resulting from the limited parallelism of computation. Datacenters and cloud computing have long lost the ?green label? originally associated with internet technology and software. Their operators need to find more economical ways to process large amounts of data. Linear searches and data indexing can be performed economically within the memory itself, and at a several orders of magnitude increase in performance, due to the inherent parallelism of memory architecture. At the same time, this comes with significant power savings due to the elimination of data transport and CPU clock cycles involved. Datacenters will be able to serve more clients, with fever servers and less power consumption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the feasibility of in-memory data search and compare algorithms which utilize the inherent repetitive structures of high density memory chips. Initial calculations suggest several orders of magnitude improvement in data throughput by in-place computation and simultaneous elimination of data transport. This addresses the industry's significant need for lower power solutions for so called "Big Data" applications, which are expected to continue their exponential rise through the Internet of Things (IoT), where cloud-stored sensor data are expected to eclipse data uploaded by humans in the near future. This Phase I project will perform a detailed architecture study along with a commercially viable and backward compatible communication protocol as well as behavioral models aimed at establishing the commercial viability and at attracting potential clients and licensing partners. Detailed simulations of the novel digital to analog sensing circuitry will thoroughly investigate the key intellectual property, laying the groundwork for the commercial realization of this innovation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is to develop an affordable suite of modular devices and software that makes it easy to design, assemble, and automate a custom bioinstrument. The goal is to provide biologists with an effective method to employ microfluidic tools and automation to accelerate scientific progress and commercialize new technologies.  Microfluidic technologies promise revolutionary improvements in diagnostics and life sciences, but their market penetration is hampered by high costs, a lack of available instruments, and ineffective training curricula.  The components of this suite will be designed to be inexpensive and re-usable, so when the biologists' needs change, they can be repurposed. The software will be designed to provide step-by-step assembly instructions and automatically configure devices, so making an instrument will be like putting together a Lego set. The technology may be used to train high school and college students in real-world laboratory techniques.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop modular devices and software that will enable biologists to produce custom bioinstrumentation to accelerate their research. The Phase I effort will focus on new microfluidics tools and will include prototyping and testing.  This development proceeds on three fronts:  1) Implementing the software to allow simultaneous and nested automation-script execution.  This allows virtualizing instruments into blocks and hiding operational complexities from users.  2) Expanding device functionality to include thermal control, e.g., for rapid PCR, incubation, sterilization, etc., and to perform accurate, pulse-free, high-temporal-response fluid dispensing for droplet generation, HPLC, sample preparation, etc.  3) Prototyping and refining user-interface and curriculum materials on biology and engineering students in high school and college to find effective graphical interfaces for instrument design and assembly. In Phase II, the plan is to incorporate these interfaces into the software, so top-level design is intuitive, and instrument assembly follows clear step-by-step visual instructions.

    the feasibility of creating fine grain ultra-high strength steel (UHSS) castings
    using a novel semi-permanent active forced cooling mold casting manufacturing
    process. With the demand for low-cost high performance cast components for light-weighting
    applications for the defense, off-highway, automotive and construction industries,
    new manufacturing methods are needed for the production of steel and cast iron
    components. This innovation will utilize active cooling methods, effectively arresting
    the grain growth of the casting within the mold, and resulting in greatly improved
    mechanical properties, process yield and productivity. Compared to traditional
    sand casting, this process is predicted to reduce manufacturing cost per casting
    by up to 40%, and to increase productivity (casting throughput) by up to 150%.
    This disruptive technology targets the steel and other ferrous metal casting industry,
    which domestically accounts for over 10 million tons of steel castings annually,
    with revenues reaching $20 billion. This industry is highly fragmented, with frequent
    consolidation of smaller players.  The proposed technology will be implemented
    at the foundry level, providing significant improvement in casting quality, operational
    efficiency, and overall casting yield. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project
    includes the development of a semi-permanent mold casting system with active cooling,
    the determination of the effects of the active cooling on the performance of the
    produced castings, and a techno-economic study of the innovation in use at the
    foundry level to determine to costs/benefits of implementation at scale. The innovation
    of this technology lies in the application of active cooling to the casting within
    the mold, and in the semi-permanent mold construction. The main objective of this
    Phase I is to develop a proof-of-concept casting apparatus and to produce a series
    of steel plates with varying forced cooling rates from which to determine the
    effect of cooling rate in the mold on grain size, elongation, strength of the
    casting and soundness of the casting. It is anticipated that this manufacturing
    process will produce aerospace grade properties at cast iron manufacturing cost.
    Completion of this Phase I will enable scale up of the casting process to complex
    parts."

Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the performance of encased atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers, reduce their fabrication costs, and optimize their properties for next-generation scanned probe microscopy technologies.  Atomic force microscopy is a workhorse technique for providing nanometer-scale information of materials, but its performance is compromised by viscous damping when operated in fluid.  The encased cantilevers to be developed in this project significantly reduces damping, leading to high force sensitivity and performance which is identical to AFM imaging done in air.  This aids quantitative interpretation of data and simplifies instrument operation. Encased cantilevers are a drop-in replacement, permitting the transformation of existing instruments into cutting-edge tools simply by exchanging the probe.  The impacts of these products will be felt in fields from biology to clean energy to materials science.

    The first technical objective of this research is to create new cantilever geometries that push the performance of our devices to the theoretical limits. The Phase I research resulted in a novel low-cost technique to fabricate encased cantilevers, thanks to the development of specialized semi-automated processing and quality control tools. The next technical objective of Phase II research is to further reduce fabrication costs by improving yields, increasing batch size, and implementing more manufacturing automation. We expect to demonstrate low-cost processing methods in which many high quality probes are fabricated efficiently. The third technical objective is to optimize these devices for next-generation scanned probe technologies including quantitative nanomechanical mapping, high-speed imaging and promising novel techniques such as photo induced force microscopy.  At the end of the project period we will have optimized products specifically targeting these high growth applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to manufacture an advanced hybrid energy harvester that can enable broad deployment of wireless sensor networks. Self-sustainable uninterrupted low-cost power supply with small size is in urgent need for internet of things, portable electric devices, wireless sensor networks, infrastructure health monitoring, active control, and battleground soldier support. Scavenging ambient energy from environment to power these devices can eliminate the cost of replacing batteries, particularly in remote environment. The hybrid energy harvesters developed in this project will significantly improve the power output and response dynamic frequency, therefore provide sufficient power to many such devices. The high power density will also enable more frequent data acquisition and transmission of such sensor networks, and promote more ubiquitous deployment of advanced sensor networks. The automatic manufacturing process will enable their adoption by various customers including internet of things.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop manufacturing processes for advanced hybrid energy harvesters. Although piezoelectric energy harvesters have found broad applications, their power density and mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency are still low, with values at microwatts to milliwatt and <10%, respectively since they primarily operate at the d31 mode of the piezoelectric transducer and the mechanical impedance mismatch between the vibration source and the harvesting device. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced hybrid energy harvesting device can provide significantly higher power density at > 100 mW and conversion efficiency at > 40% by using the more efficient d33 piezoelectric mode and with reduced stiffness in a curved structure that can efficiently transfer the energy from the vibration source to the active piezoelectric materials. The Phase II project will be focused on developing low-cost innovative automatic manufacturing process to enable their practical applications in commercial and industrial market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

    to commercialize high-strength thermoplastic composites reinforced with cellulosic
    nanoparticles (CNs) as a replacement for heavier glass&#8208;reinforced composite
    materials for structural automotive components. The broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is to create sustainable, high&#8208;performance nanocomposites.
    Expected weight savings is between 13 and 20% per component. Corporate Average
    Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations require significant increases in fuel economy
    for vehicles, which has led carmakers to look for innovative ways to shed vehicle
    weight. It has been shown that for every 10% in weight savings, vehicle fuel consumption
    is reduced by 7%. The target application is to replace heavy glass reinforcement
    in polymeric composites with CNCs for car parts, providing lighter weight vehicles

    resulted in significant reductions in cost (with more reductions expected), making
    CNs an increasingly attractive functional natural nanofiller, the processing of

    Furthermore, the company will improve performance of these materials in order
    to attain performance parity with higher&#8208;loaded glass&#8208;reinforced parts
    and potentially to compete with ultra&#8208;high performance materials such as
    carbon fiber composites and metals. This technology will be produced using efficient

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in increasing the comfort of people, such as athletes during their high intensity workouts and competitions, warehouse workers who require protective clothing in hot and humid environments, and safety (e.g. firemen and first responders) and military personnel who must endure extreme working conditions.  Our revolutionary moisture management technology utilizes a novel 3D microfluidic transport principle to move sweat from the skin to the outside of clothing, where it can drip away or be controlled. Compared with conventional moisture wicking products which are based on capillary absorption, our technology allows fabric and apparel products to remain lightweight, always dry, highly breathable and never-saturated.  ATACAMA?s technology is designed to provide the wearer an improved regulation of body temperature and comfort level during high intensity activities, contributing to both performance and safety.


     This project aims at solving the current problems of moisture-management products that are inadequate when dealing with large amount of moisture (e.g. sweat). In high sweat or high heat situations, apparel can become quickly saturated with moisture, leading to a wet, heavy, sticky feeling that impacts the performance of the wearer. Our proposed research aims to develop a broad range of textiles that can continuously transport moisture, so that fabric remain dry, breathable and lightweight during high intensity physical activities in hot and humid environment. Utilizing the large-scale manufacturing process developed in Phase I, ongoing research efforts will focus on the implementation of the technology on a broad range of fabric materials (e.g. polyester/polyurethane blends, cotton). As well, scientists at ATACAMA will optimize designs of the fluidic channels based on body sweat mapping research and will further enhance the robustness of the fluidic network. A series of breakthrough textile products (e.g. fabrics and apparel) integrated with optimized and robust 3D microfluidic-enabled moisture management technology will result from the completion of Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project promises to deliver a convenient, sustainable, cost effective, and environmentally friendly bait for crustacean fishermen, worldwide.  The  patent- pending innovation offers a formulated, synthetic product that mimics scent cues released from traditional fish bait, while offsetting unwarranted ecological impacts of current practices. Specifically, scent cues can be released at variable rates to provide optimal results in addressing fishing methods and preferences in different conditions and regions. Given rising costs of fish due to competition with omega-3 supplements producers, as well as labor and frozen storage costs of obtaining wild bait, and vessel space needed for such bait when fishing, the new bait will save fishermen time, money, and inconvenience. Commercially, cost advantages are likely to generate significant demand in addition to the overall practical advantages. From a societal perspective, a   sustainable,   synthetic product   can   dramatically   reduce "net fishing" for baiting crustacean  traps. Thus, fish could  be   conserved   in the oceanic food chain, and indiscriminate killing of sea turtles, dolphins and other by- catch would be diminished through reduced net fishing practices now employed in the capture of small wild fish traditionally used for crustacean bait.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are: to optimize solubility kinetics of the attractant-releasing matrix; further characterize naturally occurring molecules released by traditional bait fish; and validate product performance to catch indigenous crustacean species in the United States. Field research would focus on concentrations of chemo-attractants required to optimize  manufacturing  formulation  and  direct costs. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the characterization of the chemical basis for cues emitted by piscine, avian and mammalian tissue that most intensely attract crustacean species while developing a range of matrix formulations for optimally releasing such attractants in various fishing conditions. In addition to globally urgent considerations  of  by-catch  and  wild  stock  depletion, the  industry has been struggling with bait sustainability issues. These challenges have intensified with federal and state agencies seeking court orders to regulate catch limits, resulting in reduced supply and higher prices of bait fish. These circumstances frame an ecological and commercial opportunity for this synthetic bait alternative. Reducing the need to capture wild bait fish, as well as delivering cost and logistical advantages to commercial crustacean fisheries are expected to drive rapid market penetration upon completion of product research and development in this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

    field. Nanoparticle-based antireflective glass coatings have been presented in
    both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings
    suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and
    performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost,
    high-performance nanoparticle that were developed in the Phase I project are scaled
    to high throughput and low cost fabrication methods. The process/structure/property
    relationships of this novel coating will be investigated and lead to new scientific
    knowledge related to the large-scale deployment of nanoparticle based technologies.
    The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability
    tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology
    at a pilot level with industry collaborators."

    generation gas turbines where the heart of the engine, the combustor and the blade,
    are constructed from ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These developments will
    spell a new phase of air transportation beyond the current engines that rely upon
    nickel-base superalloys, which have reached their maximum capability. The ceramic
    engines are eventually expected to be 25% more efficient. The CMCs are constructed
    from fibers of silicon-carbide that are spun into net shape and then infiltrated
    with an equally robust high temperature matrix, also made from silicon carbide-based
    ceramics. The fiber composites overcome the inherent brittleness of monolithic
    ceramics while retaining their mechanical and corrosion resistance in aggressive
    environments. These composites will have applications beyond gas turbines. They
    can become the critical breakthrough for the solar collector on Concentrated Solar
    Power systems, and have the potential to be used as cladding for nuclear fuels
    for greater safety and accident tolerance. The key innovation in this Phase I
    project is the development of an additive manufacturing process for creating a
    dense and defect free matrix from polymer precursors that convert into silicon
    carbide-based ceramics.\n\n  \nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Research
    (STTR) Phase I project employs additive manufacturing to fabricate dense and defect
    free matrices for ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These composites are constructed
    from fibers of silicon carbide (SiC). The innovation in this project lies in constructing
    the matrix from polymer precursors where nanoscale layers are deposited in quick
    succession to create the matrix. These silicon-based polymer precursors convert
    into ceramics when heated to ~800 oC. Nominal processing, also known as polymer-infiltration-and-pyrolysis,
    produces cracks in the matrix despite 24 hour curing cycles. These cracks degrade
    the strength of the composite. In this project nanoscale coatings are deposited
    in the form of thin layers of liquid and then pyrolyzed into the ceramic in just
    one or two seconds. The coatings are defect free and dense. The short curing time
    allows rapid deposition of layers. The CMC can be prepared from SiC fiber preforms
    in about four hours. The feasibility of the process has been demonstrated with
    carbon fibers under a grant from Ceramics Program at NSF. In this SBIR project,
    American Manufacturing LLC seeks to demonstrate the fabrication of CMCs made from
    silicon-carbide fibers, and demonstrate their viability for high temperature applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to develop reliable technology for the production of aptamer pairs.  Aptamers are core reagents in emerging markets, regarded as alternatives to monoclonal antibodies in therapeutics, diagnostics, and imaging. They possess several appealing qualities:  Ease of in vitro synthesis, flexible modification, broad target ranges, reusability, and high thermal/chemical stability. The market value is expected to reach $5.4 billion by 2019 with a compound annual growth rate of 73.5%. One prominent negative aspect of aptamers in practical use is the lack of aptamer pairs. Pairing of monoclonal antibodies is fairly easily accomplished due to their tailor-made target binding sites. In contrast, aptamers are enriched from a random pool without such knowledge, so that it is impossible to assign the binding site of individual aptamers in pools with currently available methodologies. The proposed innovation in developing aptamers permits screening of pairs of aptamers directly from random pools. This type of direct selection from uncharacterized pools with the proposed simple workflow is a market driver to generate high revenue potential in the aptamers industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to further develop and validate methodology for screening aptamer pairs from uncharacterized aptamer pools. Currently, available tools involve massive screening with multiple post-selection steps that heavily depend on instrumentation such as next generation sequencing, automated cloning tools, and bead-based multiplex binding assays. These "brute-force" strategies may eventually produce aptamer pairs, but they are time-consuming, expensive, and inefficient, perhaps explaining why few aptamer pairs exist today. The proposed aptamer pair selection methodology addresses this unmet need in the industry by allowing only pairs to survive during the selection process against free-solution targets. The homogeneous nature of the proposed selection platform enables this tool to be scalable and multiplexable. This technology has been reduced to practice in preliminary proof-of-principle experiments. During this NSF STTR Phase I project, the objective is to test the generalizability of the innovation by applying/improving the tool to find more DNA/RNA aptamer pairs against variety of protein targets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to demonstrate a low cost, environmentally friendly co-extrusion fabrication method for producing high surface area micro- and nanofiber based nonwoven fuel filter sheets.  The micro-/nanofiber nonwoven structures are fabricated from two different hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers in a melt co-extrusion and subsequent exfoliation processing step.  The resulting porous filtration media sheets have been shown to possess superior strength, tailorable pore sizes, and fuel filtration efficiency on par with currently utilized commercial fuel filter products.  These accomplishments signify a path forward to a highly scalable manufacturing process for producing low cost thermoplastic filter products in addressing the increasingly stringent EPA regulation of ppm level water contaminant. The reduced manufacturing process complexity in melt co-extrusion is estimated to provide up to 60% reduced production costs when scaled to commercial production quantities. Additionally, a significant environmental impact will be realized through adoption of this novel production technology over competitive processes owing to its ?greener? solvent-free manufacturing aspects that eliminates the annual need for millions of gallons of organic solvents and supporting reclamation equipment currently utilized by the filtration industry in creating elctrospun and wet-laid composite nonwoven filtration media.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to fabricate nano/micro scale nonwoven fibrous filter mats for fuel filters via a novel melt co-extrusion approach, with high fuel/water filtration efficiency and superior mechanical properties, in a commercially relevant production scale, towards addressing the stringent EPA 2010 filtration regulations and its upcoming revisions in 2015. The first generation filter prototypes fabricated in Phase I STTR program exhibited up to a ten-fold increase in surface area, up to a two-fold increase in porosity and up to a six-fold the deformation strength of the commercial filters. The coextruded microporous filter fiber size distribution was comparable to a commercial melt-blown process sample and superior to the leading wet-laid technology samples. Preliminary filtration efficiency experiments on the coextruded micro-fiber filtration media prototypes exhibited 60 to greater than 80 % separation of water from ultra-low sulfur diesel as compared to 80 % water separation using commercial filter under same testing conditions. The commercial interest for the new multilayered, coextruded filtration media processing technique is centered on identification of new filtration media film polymer materials, achieving nano-sized pore distributions for improved filtration efficiency and achieving scale-up production cost savings through the improved filter film processing technique.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new natural means
    of treating diseases of fruit orchards and crops as an alternative to antibiotic
    use. Over 90% of the world's antibiotic use in agriculture is primarily to control
    fire blight, a disease that kills fruit trees. Fire blight has emerged as the
    most devastating disease of apple and pear trees worldwide. Growers apply streptomycin
    or oxytetracycline multiple times during bloom and following plant injuries to
    prevent the growth of the causative agent of fire blight, Erwinia amylovora (Ea).
    Resistant Ea strains have been isolated, and are expected to impact the human
    food chain. The proposed technology will replace these antibiotics with the microscopic
    predators of bacteria, slime molds, which are benign to humans, animals, and plants.
    These bacterial predators represent a new proprietary biocontrol approach. The
    proposed project will focus on reducing orchard carriage of Ea, and the general
    approach should be extensible to treating agricultural infections of other species
    of bacterial pathogens.  Ultimately, this innovation will contribute to increased
    public health by providing safer alternatives to existing antibiotics and disinfectants.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project proposes a novel
    approach to treating fire blight, a pathogenic disease affecting pome fruits caused
    by E. amylovora, and tomato canker caused by C. michiganensis. Both pathogens
    form biofilms connected to their virulence in plants. There is currently no treatment
    although the incidence of reoccurring infections by E. amylovora and C. michiganensis
    contribute to millions of dollars of losses in fruit production. Antibiotics and
    disinfectants typically kill only growing cells. This approach consumes growing,
    dormant, or biofilm-enmeshed bacteria. Inclusion of biofilms as targets will help
    to identify a means to solve some of the most intractable infections known. The
    research objectives of this Phase II SBIR proposal are to: 1) Screen Dictyostelid
    (Dicty) isolates in vitro for biocontrol capabilities for orchards and decontamination
    of plants/equipment, 2) test efficacy of Dicty candidates en planta, and 3) design
    methods for spore production and packaging. For commercial applications, the goal
    is to use probiotic bacteria to amplify Dicty and produce spores. For spore preservation
    and dispersal, the plan is to use methods proven to be successful and safe for
    other biocides.  Natural biocides products will be developed for agricultural
    research and to treat pathogenic outbreaks in fruit and vegetable crops."

    The broader/commercial impact of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be a cell sorter, a new research tool for life science research, animal reproduction, and cell-based therapy.  In the past decade, cell sorters have become vital in many fields, such as molecular and cellular biology, immunology, plant biology, animal reproduction, and medical diagnostics and therapeutics.  Despite their significant impact, current cell sorters have the following drawbacks: high equipment and maintenance costs, significant bio-safety concerns, and reduced cell viability and function. These drawbacks reduce the effectiveness of cell sorters in many important research studies and clinical applications. Enabled by this innovation, researchers will be able to better understand the causes of diseases, identify new therapies, and test new drugs and vaccines.  It also has the potential to improve dairy production efficiency, and aid medical doctors in making better decisions about diagnosis and treatment. In Phase II, the goal is to improve performance of the instrument, and validate the performance with end users.

    This STTR Phase II project will demonstrate the feasibility of a microfluidic-based, bio-compatible, bio-safe, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cell sorters are powerful, high-throughput, single-cell characterization and purification tools that are vital for labs in fields such as molecular biology, pathology, plant biology, stem cell biology, and medical diagnostics.  The technology is based on acoustofluidic (i.e., the fusion of acoustics and microfluidics) cell sorting chips that preserve the integrity and functionality of sorted cells.  Current cell sorting systems reduce cell viability, integrity, and cell function due to high shear stress, high impact force, and high driving voltage, which reduces their effectiveness as a research tool, and in clinical applications.  Unlike current cell sorters that use electrostatic force to sort cells, which require 12,000 V of driving voltage, the proposed technology uses acoustic tweezers to sort cells, and requires only 10 V, which significantly reduces cell damage.  Compared with existing cell sorters, the proposed microfluidic cell sorter will have the following advantages: 1) high bio-compatibility; 2) high bio-safety; and 3) lower costs and lower maintenance. In addition, the cell sorter will be more accessible to researchers and address existing unmet needs in the market (e.g., sorting fragile or sensitive cells while preserving high viability and function). This will accelerate research findings and improve diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address the need for alternative imaging technologies for women with mammographically dense breast tissue by significantly enhancing clinical breast ultrasound images. Mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening; however, both dense breast tissue and cancerous lesions appear white on a mammogram, making it difficult to reliably detect cancers. Women who have dense tissue - 26 million in the United States alone - need alternative imaging technologies for early stage cancer detection. Studies show that the addition of a single screening ultrasound increases cancer detection by 28% over mammography alone, with significantly higher combined diagnostic accuracy. Despite these findings, a fourfold increase in the false positive rate undermines ultrasound use by physicians in breast imaging. A technology that improves ultrasound image clarity in dense breast tissue would revolutionize breast cancer imaging by allowing physicians to noninvasively detect malignancies previously obscured by their size and/or poor contrast and distinguish them from benign lesions. There is the strong potential to save lives by substantially increasing the overall cancer detection rate while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives.


    The proposed project seeks to develop an adaptive beamforming technology that will significantly improve the clinical utility of ultrasound imaging. Unlike traditional beamforming, adaptive beamforming estimates the time delays between ultrasound probe elements and does not require prior knowledge of the speed of sound along the beam path to produce an image of the tissue. The more accurate time delays result in improved beam focusing and allow for larger transducer arrays, which in turn allows for deeper signal penetration - enhancing signal strength, spatial resolution, and image contrast. The preceding Phase I project used simulated ultrasound data to develop a novel adaptive beamforming technique with least-mean square filters that improves signal-to-noise ratio by up to 32 dB and image contrast by up to 38%. The Phase II project objectives are to acquire raw, radio-frequency ultrasound data from both representative breast phantoms and an in vivo study; to optimize and finalize the adaptive beamforming algorithm; to process the study data and evaluate improved image contrast and clinical benefit; to produce a software application embodying the adaptive beamforming technique; and to design the network architecture and data management approach required to deliver that software as a license or as a Software as a Service (SaaS) product to medical facilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is making tough, 3D printed parts that can be
    directly manufactured through additive processes commercially available. Additive
    manufacturing has potential to revolutionize the way parts are produced by streamlining
    product design, production, and validation, which allows for low production costs
    and accelerated lead times. The penetration of additive technology into industrial
    processes has been greatly slowed by the current inability to 3D print parts of
    any stiffness with materials properties on par with traditionally manufactured
    parts. Particularly, 3D printed materials tend to tear or fracture more readily
    between successive printed layers. At Adaptive 3D Technologies, we have developed
    resins that produce tough, robust parts that are tougher than many current 3D
    printed products in the x, y and z planes by achieving covalent crosslinking across
    printed layers. These materials and processing techniques will help drive additive
    manufacturing into large volume, yet customizable, market sectors to increase
    efficiency and productivity across industries.  The printed parts resulting from
    our printable materials will further U.S. manufacturing by lowering production
    costs, increasing product performance and reshoring advanced manufacturing. \n\n\nThis
    project is focused on understanding interface chemistry and adhesion phenomena
    in a special class of low-viscosity, thiol-ene resins to produce a range of mechanically
    tough materials that are 3D printable via stereolithography (SLA). A significant
    problem with current SLA approaches is that successive printed layers do not adhere
    sufficiently together, leading to large reductions in toughness as measured by
    the stress-strain response in soft, viscoelastic and stiff materials. Our Phase
    II research explores the tradeoffs between molecular architecture, reactivity,
    resin viscosity, and key printing parameters to develop improved materials to
    enable tougher printed parts than industry standards along multiple axes of deformation
    at similar printing speeds and feature sizes well below 100 microns. We have developed
    a portfolio of 3D printable materials with room temperature Young's moduli near
    2 MPa, 20 MPa, 200 MPa or 2 GPa.  Soft and viscoelastic materials have strain
    capacities well above 100% in all print directions, including when measured perpendicular
    to print layer interfaces. We expect to further our polymers' thermomechanical
    properties through the proposed Phase II SBIR effort by incorporating proper additives
    into our systems to control color, shelf life, aesthetics, mechanical properties
    and compatibility with various jetting techniques."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in demonstrating the commercial implementation of NBD Nanotechnologies, Inc.'s (NBD) Enhanced Condensation Coating. NBD's external surface coating sustains dropwise condensation on copper-based tubes, resulting in energy savings and increased efficiency for industrial condensers in steam power and thermal desalination plants. NBD's innovative and proprietary techniques ensure adhesion onto the substrate while not compromising the thermal resistance with the coating's sub-microscale thickness. NBD has validated the increased efficiency of its external surface condenser coating technology at a lab-scale and will carry out pilot tests to quantify the efficiency gain and technology durability at a system-level in industrial condensers, as requested by utility customers. NBD presents a technology that addresses the key commercial bottlenecks of durability, scalability and performance, which have stymied coatings in condensers, presenting a leapfrogging technology that addresses the water-energy nexus. Every 1% improvement in power plant efficiency results in $10MM revenue per plant per year, as stated by a partnering power generation company. Thus, any improvement in the efficiency of a steam condenser has significant impact that directly benefits both global energy and water sustainability efforts.



    This project contributes to R&D advancement focused on: large-scale chemical and coating processing, surface wettability, nano-and micro-scale heat transfer, condensation, and water and energy resource sustainability. The project's multidisciplinary nature reflects the dynamic aspects of condensation heat transfer phenomenon, which covers varying length scales (nano, micro, meso and macro scale) and time scales. Thus, the challenging nature of optimizing and sustaining enhanced condensation invites innovative and creative solutions to mitigate the water and energy resource management problems. During Phase I, the project demonstrated the proof of concept of the coating's condensation enhancement for both industrial condensers with pure steam (and trace amounts of non-condensable gases) and for HVAC/dehumidification systems where condensation occurs with higher concentrations of non-condensable gases. The objective of phase II proposal is to address and facilitate the required steps for scaling up and integrating NBD's condenser coating into industrial condensers' supply chain. NBD has identified industrial condensers as its primary entry market, where a greater increase in condenser system performance and savings in cost and fuel consumption can be reached. NBD has been establishing partnerships for pilot studies to perform larger scale experimental tests to validate its technology's performance, durability and system-level efficiency gains empirically.

    and maintaining US technology leadership over a wide range of electronic applications
    and consumer electronic devices.\t\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) Phase II project advances a novel three-dimensional through-silicon vias
    (TSV) selective metallization technology to fabricate low cost and scalable 3D
    integrated circuits (IC). Physical and economical limitations for two-dimensional
    scaling (so called \"Moore?s Law\") prevent further increase of integration density
    to improve the performance of IC. These challenges have stimulated the development
    of 3D TSV technology (so called \"More than Moore\") in order to increase the
    speed and bandwidth of the devices as well as to decrease the form factor and
    power consumption of integrated microsystems. However, the mass adoption of 3D
    IC is limited by the high cost of 3D TSV interconnects (due to the use of expensive
    vapor deposition and chemical-mechanical damascene processes) and its poor scalability
    (due to low conformality of physical and chemical vapor deposited films) to high
    aspect ratios and smaller via sizes. Proprietary and patented 3D TSV selective
    metallization technology developed during Phase I project will be further optimized
    and qualified on production tools to address cost and scalability issues of 3D
    TSV interconnects. Enabling low cost and scalable 3D ICs will allow heterogeneous
    systems integration for next generation smart phones and other consumer electronic
    devices."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter
    System that will be the first to provide clinicians with a tool to manage the
    most significant complications (infection, thrombosis, and loss of lock solution)
    associated with chronic hemodialysis catheter use. More than 430,000 Americans
    currently receive hemodialysis treatments, and this prevalence is expected to
    grow 3-5% each year. A significant portion of the $29 billion spent annually treating
    ESRD patients in the U.S. is dedicated to managing complications with vascular
    access ? many of which are associated with catheters. It typically costs between
    $2,000 and $40,000 per patient to treat a blood-borne infection, which translates
    to more than $3 billion each year in the U.S. There is a need for this product
    to allow physicians to confidently use whatever lock therapy is clinically best
    on a per-patient basis. The catheter system will enable for the development and
    FDA approval of new, non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents, which have been unable
    to gain/maintain approval due to concerns of leakage. The device has the potential
    to be a market leader in the $3 billion U.S. market for vascular access devices
    and accessories. \n\n\nThe proposed project shall improve and further evaluate
    a Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter System. Over 400,000 Americans undergo
    hemodialysis annually. Common complications are catheter-related bloodstream infection,
    thrombosis and thrombotic occlusions, each of which can be fatal. The primary
    solution to these complications is the use of heparin and antimicrobial lock solutions.
    However, existing catheters present the possibility of accidental infusion of
    these highly concentrated solutions into the circulation during the locking procedure
    or during the locked period between uses of the catheter. These leakages increase
    the risk of toxicity, and FDA-approved anticoagulants that leak into the systemic
    circulation can cause minor or major bleeding. The catheter system being developed
    in this project will significantly decrease complications tied to the loss of
    lock solutions, such as life-threatening infections, toxicity and bleeding events.
    The research shall include refinement of the catheter?s design (material selection
    and mechanical tests); ensuring that manufacture of catheters is consistent; and
    additional testing in vivo. The project is expected to demonstrate that the catheter
    system is compatible with lock solutions, shows adequate flow rate, has sufficient
    mechanical integrity, can be manufactured consistently, and is demonstrated to
    be biocompatible with an in vivo model."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a cost-effective mechanical ventilator
    designed specifically to address the need for pandemic stockpiling and surge capacity
    use. The output of this Phase will be a new ventilator ready for FDA clearance
    and market entry in 2017. US government planners have described a need for many
    thousands of additional ventilators in the event of a pandemic influenza or other
    large-scale medical emergency. Severe influenza often leads to respiratory distress
    which cannot be dealt with in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Given some
    time and a mechanical ventilator, the human body can often clear the infection
    on its own. Without help from the ventilator, patients may die. Manufacturers
    of current ventilators have attempted to reconfigure their existing offerings
    to meet the stockpiling demand. Unfortunately none of these devices are able to
    match the price/performance ratio needed to make stockpiling in large numbers
    economically feasible. Building upon an innovative platform for mechanical ventilation
    developed in Phase I, the project intends to develop a ?gold standard? device
    for pandemic preparedness and emergency use. \n\nThe proposed project is to develop
    a novel and much needed medical device ? a mechanical ventilator suitable for
    pandemic use and emergency stockpiling. If a severe pandemic were to strike the
    United States, the number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation has been
    estimated to be over 700,000. Of these, the most severe cases are often in the
    very old and the very young.  There are currently 62,274 ventilators in use in
    the United States, of which only 23,485 are capable of supporting pediatric patients.
    Research and development activities will provide opportunities for creating new
    intellectual property, new technology, and new clinical methods for managing respiratory
    distress. This research and development project is divided into two Aims. In the
    first, the company will conduct extensive design research to analyze and understand
    the clinical need and all product requirements. We will then design, build, and
    test a series of prototype concepts using sophisticated software modeling, benchtop
    test platforms including mechanical and electronic lung simulation, and real-world
    user feedback. In the second Aim the company will address manufacturing and supply
    chain requirements, integrate design for manufacturing, and build and test a final
    series of near-production prototypes. These late-stage test procedures will include
    clinical performance and accuracy in accordance with regulatory standards, electromagnetic
    interference, and mechanical durability including vibration, noise, and water
    ingress in preparation for FDA regulatory clearance."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to open price-sensitive research, medical imaging and surveillance communities to the benefits of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) waveband without the complexity or expense of traditional hyperspectral systems. The multispectral SWIR imager developed in this project supports medical microscope and small animal imaging of infrared fluorescence for cancer detection, localization and excision.  SWIR fluorophores produce no autofluorescence background while simultaneously enhancing tissue penetration depth and efficiency by factors of 10 or more. InView?s imaging platform can build large markets by the development of specialized image processing and analytical methods for specific applications in pharmaceutical manufacturing, food safety, solar panel and semiconductor inspection, machine vision, and navigation.  InView?s camera platform embodies the revolutionary new sampling theory of compressive sensing, a field whose applications in information processing have grown exponentially.  The innovative architecture and the state-of-the-art software already embedded in the camera and user interface can enhance and possibly transform lab and clinical modalities in dynamic multi-fluorescence imaging, in vivo functional imaging, tissue viability and pathology studies, and advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in an operational low-cost, multi-color shortwave infrared (SWIR) camera that can be directly mounted on microscopes for supporting compelling micro-imaging applications in scientific, industrial and biomedical imaging.  The electro-optical, opto-mechanical, and processing software architecture of the camera is based on Compressive Sensing, a new sampling technique that reduces data collection requirements for high resolution imaging to well below Nyquist limits. This design does not use expensive sensor arrays or complicated spectrometers.  Instead, high-resolution pictures are computationally constructed from single-detector measurements. The ?single-pixel camera? architecture was commercialized by InView as a monochromatic SWIR imager.  In Phase 1, InView successfully demonstrated that only simple modifications to its  monochromatic camera design can produce full color imaging. The objective of Phase 2 is to modify only the components that are necessary to transform the existing monochromatic camera into a multi-color imager with the overall design goal of maintaining the existing camera size, weight and cost so that InView can offer low-cost multispectral SWIR imaging to the price sensitive microscopy community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the development  of a new class of graphical-media-design system that lies between today's 2D digital paint systems and 3D computer-aided design systems. This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an ultra-light, modular wind turbine for use in buoyant airborne wind energy systems. Reduced turbine weight has a cascading effect on total airborne system mass, allowing a significantly smaller, lower cost buoyant structure to be used to access high altitude winds. At heights up to 2,000 feet winds are strong and consistent, allowing for the production of low-cost, reliable power at a broad array of sites. High altitude winds have over five times the energy potential of ground winds accessed by tower-mounted turbines, opening the potential for a major new renewable energy resource to be harnessed. In addition, the containerized deployment of airborne wind turbines has the potential to expand wind development to sites that are not feasible today, including sites that are remote or have weak ground-level winds. Overall, the technology holds the potential to significantly lower energy costs and improve reliability for remote industrial, community, and military customers and represents a major step forward in unlocking the abundant high-altitude wind resource to help in the global pursuit of greater adoption of renewable energy sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project will focus on reducing the total weight of the wind turbine system.  Turbine weight is one of the most critical cost drivers of buoyant airborne wind energy systems. For each kilogram removed from the turbine, an additional kilogram can be removed from the inflatable shell and tethers, resulting in a significantly smaller and lower cost system. The lightest commercially available small- to medium-sized wind turbine weighs 31.1 kilograms per kilowatt of capacity, which is too heavy for an economically-viable airborne turbine. By incorporating a compact, modular architecture, a lightweight permanent magnet direct-drive (PMDD) generator and high-strength composite materials, the proposed Phase II research effort aims to double the power density of traditional medium size turbines, making the proposed system suitable for use in an airborne application, while maintaining a high level of reliability and cost performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of an innovative cyber security solution based on Power Fingerprinting (PFP) for vulnerable wireless networking equipment and smart grid infrastructure. PFP can prevent well-funded adversaries from compromising these critical systems and operate without being discovered. The PFP monitor can assess the integrity directly on the target platforms, including those for which there is no commercial solution available. PFP can be applied to a variety of embedded platform and can coexist with traditional cyber security solutions adding an extra layer of protection in a defense-in-depth approach. These characteristics make PFP capable of detecting sophisticated attacks, such as the recent Stuxnet worm. Traditional peripheral cyber security approaches, such as anti-virus and firewalls, are being adapted for the target platforms but with limited success. PFP addresses a growing need to secure critical infrastructure, such as communications and power generation and distribution, and directly monitor their execution. PFP has dual application in the commercial and government cybersecurity markets, particularly for resource-constrained and embedded platforms. PFP has the potential to become a fundamental player in cyber-security by protecting the nation?s infrastructure and promoting further development of the economic base and employment.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to demonstrate a commercial prototype of a novel cyber security solution for wireless network infrastructure and Smart Grid applications based on a novel approach called Power Fingerprinting (PFP). PFP provides integrity assessment and intrusion detection for embedded and resource-constrained platforms by using an external device to monitor side-channel information and applying signal processing techniques to determine the execution status of a processor. Due to computational resource constraints, the application of traditional cyber security solutions to the proposed target applications is very limited. Furthermore, there are no commercial solutions available capable of directly monitoring the execution and detecting intrusions in networking equipment, such as wireless routers, or control systems used in the Smart Grid. The objectives of this Phase 2 effort include: 1) Demonstrate a PFP monitor commercial prototype for wireless network and Smart Grid platforms, 2) Leverage PFP tools to enhance automatic characterization on target platforms, and 3) Integrate suitable mechanisms to improve timing synchronization. At the end of Phase 2, a blind test demonstration of the prototype PFP monitor detecting malicious intrusions will be provided and serve as the launching pad into commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will eliminate remaining barriers to the production of bamboo fibers for use as a reinforcement in polymer composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be an increased usage of sustainable materials, increased revenue for US agriculture, and increased domestic and international sales of a new and innovative product line.  Success in this project will also lead to domestic job creation needed to support the research, manufacturing, and sales of these composites. The processes to be finalized during this Phase II project will support the growth of a nascent based on US-manufactured, environmentally-friendly products. Within three years of launch, it is expected that over $4 million in revenue will be generated by sales of bamboo fiber.  Moreover, increases in bamboo cultivation as a result of these new products will help mitigate adverse environmental impacts and improve public health. This will be done by the inherent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the plant growth cycle, and a reduction in the pollution associated with the use of high-energy glass fiber and plastics processing techniques.

    This Phase II project will address the following research topics:  species variations, manufacturability, additional high value products, additional composite properties, processing and treatment optimization, and commercial scale-up. The team will assess the mechanical and physical implications of variations in feedstock by the use of filament tensile testing. Surface treatments specific to bamboo fibers will be finalized, with the goal of increased fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, mitigation of water absorption, and compatibility with at least three major resins systems.  These treatments will be evaluated via composite tensile testing, filament testing and water immersion testing.  Manufacturing studies will be performed to verify compatibility with commercial scale manufacturing equipment. The design and manufacture of a small scale, batch plant will address technological and automation challenges.  This plant will provide a bridge to a commercial-scale plant designed to produce 6 million pounds of fiber yearly.  Additional innovative aspects to the project lie in the assessment of a bamboo species compatible with climates in the US, automation of raw bamboo processing, and implementation of a fully optimized multi-step material functionalization process.

    a new development in man?s ability to keep birds away from the airspace surrounding
    an airplane or out of the way of the massive rotors of wind turbines. Animals
    respond to a bright ultraviolet light in the same way as humans respond to a bright
    flashlight in their eyes. If the light is strong enough, it causes an involuntary
    behavioral response resulting in the animal being deterred from the area of the
    light source. Ultraviolet light has the advantage of being visible to most species
    of animals while being invisible to humans. This Phase II project builds on the
    Phase I project that demonstrated with 98% confidence that bird behavior is influenced
    by the presence of the wildlife deterrence system?s bright ultraviolet light in
    a completely natural environment with no human presence. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is focused on three high value applications of the wildlife
    deterrence system. They are renewable alternative energy (wind farms), air transportation
    (planes and airports), and agriculture (aquaculture and agriculture). Renewable
    energy is at the top of the U.S. priority list. Wind energy is one of the most
    promising forms of alternative energy. At the same time, there is an immediate
    and pressing need to reduce the mortality rate of endangered and protected species
    at wind farms. A compelling global need for the wildlife deterrence system is
    exemplified by the aviation industry and the incidence of bird strikes. The U.S.
    Department of Transportation Inspector General reported in August 2012 that in
    the past two decades, wildlife strikes have increased from 1,770 reported in 1990
    to 9,840 reported in 2011, a greater than five-fold increase. Thirdly, although
    not at the level of importance as protection of aircraft and deterrence of birds
    from wind farm turbine rotors, worldwide seafood demand has grown annually by
    8.3 percent since 1970. This means that worldwide aquaculture production has rapidly
    expanded. Of particularly promising potential are solutions to the mussel farming
    problems of the international aquaculture industry which is well established in
    many parts of the world. All producing locations in North America and Europe share
    a common problem of severe predation loss from diving ducks such as the Common
    Eider that can be devastating to the mussel producer, with the potential to wipe
    out an entire crop (100%)."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  High Efficiency, Compact Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)'
- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks
    to enable the commercialization of a scalable bottom-up microwave synthesis process
    invented and demonstrated for obtaining bulk thermoelectric nanomaterials with
    25% higher figure-of-merit ZT at 50% cost savings than the state of the art. We
    anticipate the results of the project to expand the scope of, and transform, high
    efficiency thermoelectric refrigeration and waste-heat harvesting technologies.
    In particular, this project aims to transmute our synthesis approach to a manufacturing
    technology that consistently yields ton-scale nanothermoelectrics with ZT>1. The
    objectives are to 1) Complete the design of, and implement a microwave manufacturing
    platform with a 10 tons/year capacity, 2) Develop protocols for industrial-scale
    wafer production from the nanomaterials for device fabrication, and 3) Devise
    methods to further increase ZT through process optimization. The knowhow generated
    from the demonstration of kilogram-scale production shown in Phase I provides
    the foundation for the Phase II effort. We will focus on the widely used bismuth
    and antimony tellurides, and their alloys. We will strive to maximize process
    flexibility to facilitate greater ZT gains through process optimization and to
    facilitate the adaptation of our process technology to other thermoelectric nanomaterials
    for refrigeration and waste-heat harvesting.\n\n\tThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project will be to unlock and access the multi-billion dollar
    potential of thermoelectrics for transforming solid-state cooling. Thermoelectric
    materials already support a ~$1B/year industry, but has promise to be multi-fold
    higher if the conversion efficiency is increased just two-fold by using nanomaterials.
    The project will scale-up a nanomaterials manufacturing technology targeted to
    create new high efficiency solid-state cooling devices that can replace the current
    refrigeration and air-conditioning technologies based on environmentally unfriendly
    gases, and create high-efficiency electricity generators from waste heat, significantly
    expanding the thermoelectric markets and impacting global energy usage and addressing
    global environmental concerns. The work performed in the project will result in
    low-cost high-value thermoelectric nanomaterials manufacturing to replace extant
    energy-intensive methods that cannot cost-effectively produce high-efficiency
    materials. This will lead to introduction of a new class of nanomaterials with
    superior properties than that available currently in the marketplace. The work
    will expand the scope of thermoelectric device applications, paving the way for
    power generation technologies through implementation of our manufacturing method
    for other materials systems. The project is anticipated to create 10-25 jobs in
    3-5 years besides making New York State a global player in thermoelectrics innovation
    and nanomaterials manufacturing."

    the clinical and market need for an X-ray replacement technology that is portable,
    low-cost, and safe. While X-ray is the current dominant modality for diagnostic
    imaging of bone anatomy, it possesses many limitations: emission of radiation,
    bulky, and expensive. In the Phase I project, we demonstrated feasibility of the
    technology with a handheld ultrasound prototype, which demonstrated 3D freehand
    bone imaging using an ex vivo whole pig lumbar spine model. Phase II research
    objectives include: 1) Design and build a preproduction ultrasound prototype;
    2) Develop a model registration-based 3D bone imaging application and release
    a clinical software version with formal verification and validation testing; and
    3) Prepare the device for clinical use with human subjects and experimentally
    validate in an ex vivo porcine lumbar spine model with physician testing. It is
    anticipated that this project will result in the demonstration of a new medical
    device with demonstrated efficacy for improved administration of spinal anesthesia
    via 3D portable real-time spinal bone imaging. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is an X-ray replacement technology based on medical
    ultrasound, which addresses market segments including spinal anesthesia, orthopedic,
    and emergency medicine. Rivanna Medical is targeting the spinal anesthesia market
    first because of the compelling market and clinical need. Due to lack of availability
    of safe, portable, and inexpensive medical imaging for bone anatomy, these procedures
    currently exhibit high first-attempt failure rates. Failures result in poor patient
    outcomes and higher costs for health care providers. In this application, our
    lead device, the SpineFinder, would improve success rates via real-time guidance
    of spinal injections at the patient?s bedside. The societal impact of a safe,
    inexpensive, portable bone imaging products includes more successful procedures,
    better patient outcomes, and lower healthcare costs. Additionally, the public
    would benefit by an overall reduction in ionizing radiation exposure from X-ray
    and a subsequent reduction in cancers. The general scientific and technological
    understanding of acoustics will be enhanced through this project by a better understanding
    of ultrasound interactions with specular reflecting surfaces, such as bone."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project should provide a novel cyber security solution for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) based on Power Fingerprinting (PFP) technology. PFP provides integrity assessment and intrusion detection for embedded and resource-constrained platforms by using an external device to monitor side-channel information and applying signal processing techniques to determine the execution status of a processor. Because PFP monitoring is performed by an external device, it can be applied to platforms with constrained computational resources, such as Industrial Control Systems, for which solutions based on traditional cyber security approaches are practically inexistent. There are no commercially available solutions capable of monitoring the execution and detecting intrusions directly in core ICS elements, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The objectives of this Phase II effort include: 1) Develop a PFP monitor prototype for ICS by integrating commercially available components, 2) Develop the necessary software tools to support ICS monitoring, and 3) Validate the prototype using representative ICS platforms used in critical infrastructure. At the end of Phase II, the prototype PFP monitor will be demonstrated detecting malicious intrusions in blind tests, serving as stepping stone to bring this technology into commercialization.

    The broader/commercial impact of this project is the development of an innovative cyber security solution for ICS in critical infrastructure. PFP can prevent well-funded adversaries from compromising critical systems without being discovered. The PFP monitor can assess the integrity of core elements in ICSs for which there are no commercial solutions available. PFP can be applied to embedded platforms and can coexist with traditional cyber security solutions adding an extra layer of protection in a defense-in-depth approach. These characteristics make PFP a powerful tool for detecting sophisticated covert attacks to ICS, such as the recent Stuxnet worm. Traditional cyber security approaches, such as anti-virus and firewalls, are being adapted for ICS with very limited success. Thus, PFP addresses a growing need to secure ICSs in critical infrastructure and directly monitor their execution. PFP has dual application in the commercial and government markets, particularly for resource-constrained and embedded platforms. PFP has the potential to become a fundamental player in cyber-security by protecting the nation?s infrastructure and promoting further development of the economic base and employment.

    demonstrate and develop technology for the roll-to-roll production of continuous
    graphene films.  The graphene production technology is based upon innovations
    in the graphene synthesis and graphene handling, addressing critical deficiencies
    limiting industrial manufacture of graphene.  The synthesis process is performed
    at atmospheric pressure, allowing roll-to-roll graphene formation on continuous
    tapes of copper foil passed through the growth region.   This eliminates the need
    for an expensive vacuum furnace and allows fabrication of graphene films larger
    than the furnace size.  The graphene handling process developed during Phase I
    enables the transfer of graphene sheets from the metal catalyst to nearly any
    smooth surface without any high temperature steps and without the use of harsh
    chemicals.  Most importantly, the graphene transfer preserves the original metal
    substrate for reuse.  The reusable substrate dramatically reduces the cost of
    graphene production and eliminates the largest source of waste in the process.
    \ In Phase II, we will demonstrate the continuous film processes for graphene
    synthesis and transfer to new surfaces and design a large area roll-to-roll graphene

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative high-productivity approach to manufacturing hard and brittle materials like ceramics, semiconductors, and glass. The objective of this proposal is to build on the successful Phase I feasibility study to demonstrate an efficient and productive method that could manufacture ceramic and semiconductors with excellent part quality. The process, termed Micro-Laser Assisted Machining (micro-LAM), allows a cheaper (~40-60%), faster (by two to five times), and better method of machining and manufacturing hard and brittle materials by combining the preferential heat from a laser source and extreme pressure from a diamond tool. The status quo technology for manufacturing these materials requires extensive machining hours to obtain good part quality, which is not economical. The demand for high-end ceramics and semiconductors is continuously increasing; however, high production costs have forced manufacturers to use other materials with inferior properties.  The goal of this effort is to address this unmet need by commercializing the micro-LAM technology by the end of Phase II. A minimum viable product will be tested at industrial partner sites to obtain firsthand customer feedback, which is key to accelerating the commercialization process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in semiconductor (microelectronics) manufacturing, optics (mirrors and windows), and precision mechanical products (bearing and seals), where the superior properties of advanced semiconductor and engineered ceramic materials are required to achieve performance criteria. This technology will enable entirely new capabilities for production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing limitations. The micro-LAM technology also has potential applications for emerging technologies, such as wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where high-power and high-temperature operation of advanced devices is required. The current target market size, including optics, semiconductor, advanced ceramics and glass parts manufacturing, is approximately $250 million, with a 15%/year growth rate. Once market acceptance is established in the target market segment, the micro-LAM tooling will be launched into the larger diamond turning machine (DTM) market, with a total size of $2.4 billion.  There are approximately 10,000 DTMs in the United States alone (with ~ 500 new tools introduced per year).

    The Innovation of this Phase II project is developing physics-based analytical models to analyze gearbox components for safety, longevity, reliability and cost by predicting (1) New component performance, and optimal time-to-remanufacture, (2) Qualification of used components for remanufacturing process, and (3) Predicting the remanufactured component performance. Current industry approach is to design, manufacture, operate, and retire assets based on traditional methods, which typically rely on standards-based estimates, historical data/domain experience, physical examination, testing, monitoring, and inspection. This process is extremely time and resource intensive. Further, this process often does not consider the opportunity to use remanufacturing processes to extend/enhance product performance. Sentient technology will address these issues and fulfill the industry requirements. Phase II will expand the Phase I technology to include additional gearbox materials, damage modes and remanufacturing processes in a more comprehensive design and analysis framework capable of predicting optimal time-to-remanufacture and optimizing refurbishing operations to extend the useful life of  components. This SBIR technology reduces physical testing using virtual testing, and will assist in remanufacturing of high value, high demand rotorcraft, automotive and wind turbine gearbox components. Hence, it decreases the energy, material resources, and costs associated with manufacturing, and ensures that the product performance is maintained/improved.

    The broader/commercial impact of the SBIR technology is within aerospace, energy, and transportation industries on high dollar assets that rely on the reliable function of highly engineered (and thus expensive) gearboxes. Our new Advanced Manufacturing partnership based application provides the US manufacturing supply chain a first mover and a sustainable competitive advantage greater than the 6% offshore labor rate advantage. This advantage comes through reuse of high value-added assets optimized for maximum lifetime use, coupled with decreased time and costs associated with traditional physical testing and analysis methods. This is possible based on the high-level of detail included in physics-based models, which (conceptually) decode material information at the microstructure level just as the Human Genome Project decodes genetic information at the DNA level. Our innovation enables the customer to rapidly, cost effectively, and accurately predict a product?s lifecycle (design, manufacture, operation, degradation, maintenance, repair/remanufacture, and retirement) at the material, component, and assembly/system scales. We foresee a future opportunity due to the fact that our innovation developed under this NSF grant will give us a competitive advantage of lower costs to provide the software and service. Our cost to deploy the technology is 10X lower than traditional companies in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to establish the feasibility of a high-efficiency, low-cost electric power generator called the C-TEC, for Concentration-mode Thermoelectric Converter.  The C-TEC is an electrochemical converter that generates electricity from heat using a thermally-regenerated concentration gradient of ions across an electrolyte membrane, rather than a thermal gradient across a semiconductor material.  This important difference yields a technology with the potential for the high efficiency of a fuel cell, combined with the low cost, low maintenance, and long life of a thermoelectric device.  Detailed theoretical models and calculations have shown the potential for greater than 30% efficiency in similar devices, but in practice, only 15% to 19% efficiency has ever been realized.  The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the key elements of a low-cost, high-efficiency design, and created a simple efficiency algorithm for developing a device capable of demonstrating high efficiency.  This efficiency model will be refined using prototype verification builds during the Phase II program, and then used to design, build and test a prototype device suitable for the distributed power generation markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of low cost, high efficiency generators that can operate using any form of heat in a wide variety of applications.  C-TEC generators are inherently more versatile than other technologies that require high-grade, specific fuels, such as engines (gasoline), turbines (natural gas), fuel cells (hydrogen), or solar cells (sunlight).  The C-TEC makes no noise, has no moving parts, and requires no maintenance, making it ideal for long-term power generation.  Clean, distributed electricity provided by microCHP (Combined Heat and Power systems at less than 5 kW electrical power) enables breakthrough electrical efficiency greater than 90% in the home, representing an important technology for the widespread adoption of the electric car.  The C-TEC-powered electric car will use domestic natural gas as a bridge to renewables, reducing emissions and dependence on foreign oil and massive infrastructure development costs associated with upgrades to our grid capacity.  Other technologies have been proposed as prime movers for microCHP, including fuel cells and engines, but these fall short in terms of cost and maintenance.  Ultimately, the cost and versatility of the C-TEC will provide economic advantages like fast payback to drive the adoption of new clean technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the continuing development of novel ultrafast, highly selective, high permeability ion-exchange fiber composites (IXFCs) for removing perchlorate from drinking water. The proposed material removes perchlorate 10-100 times faster than the best available technology and employs a low-cost production method compatible with widely available manufacturing equipment. Rapid contaminant removal is made possible by the use of micron-scale mass transfer distances; whereas commonly used beads and granular media are limited to much larger sizes resulting in drawbacks such as difficult containment and enormous pressure drops. However, IXFCs display both high permeability and self-containment due to their permanently intertwined, self-supporting structure. Serionix demonstrated the feasibility of this technology in Phase I and will continue in the Phase II with the following key goals: 1) optimization of ultra-high capacity IXFCs for perchlorate removal; 2) design/build IXFC purification cartridges for evaluation by industrial partners; 3) identify and validate chemistries for complimentary IXFCs that are selective for heavy metals such as lead and mercury; and 4) produce IXFCs at a pilot scale and develop strategy for commercial production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this research is the development and commercialization of a low-cost technology enabling regulatory compliance and improved protection of human health. The first targeted application is perchlorate, which the EPA is set to regulate in drinking water by 2014. This represents only the first commercial opportunity for a platform technology with the ultimate potential to transform the industrial and residential water treatment landscape. Future applications may include ultrahigh efficiency water deionization, softening, and industrial wastewater recycling, personal protective equipment and clothing, and high activity solid acid/base catalysts. Dissemination of data and interpretation will contribute to improved understanding of mass transfer characteristics in fibrous sorbent materials used in both water and air treatment.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    focus on the enablement of comparative effectiveness research (CER), evidence
    based medicine (EBM), and personalized medicine (PM) by researchers utilizing
    both clinical and complex biomolecular data. The first phase of this grant was
    focused on a feasibility study working with customers to determine the extent
    to which the tools we were creating would and could be utilized in practice. This
    phase is focused on implementation of these tools in real-world health care environments
    and creating systemic improvements of healthcare by improving tools available
    for self-evaluation by hospital administrators and clinicians alike. There will
    be four key objectives accomplished as a result of this proposal. The first is
    the development of care-improvement algorithms for pediatric ICU patients with
    sepsis and congenital heart disease. The second will be a reporting engine that
    mines electronic medical records to create CER reports for patients. The third
    is an easy-to-use enterprise level reporting engine to check compliance with national
    standard health care quality metrics and to create new metrics for care improvement.
    The final objective is to create a personalized medicine reporting system based
    on next generation sequencing data. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential
    of this project is significant because it capitalizes on two trends in health
    care - digitizing patient clinical data and the increasing use of molecular sequencing
    and microarray data. The commercialization of the technical innovations referenced
    in this project will enable researchers and clinicians to generate true Comparative
    Effectiveness Research (CER), Evidence-based precision medicine (EMB) and Personalized
    Medicine reports (PMR). The ultimate objective of this technology is improving
    patient outcomes. Leveraging historical patient data in CER to eliminate ineffective
    therapies from the health care system, coupled with utilizing genetic information
    to create a more personalized model of health care,  will focus precious health
    care dollars on effective therapies optimized for the individual. Ultimately,
    this tool will be appealing to every segment of the health care industry including
    clinicians, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies due
    to the increases in quality and cost savings that will be created."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at developing a handheld system that a cancer surgeon uses to detect and eliminate microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed after gross resection of the tumor. An integrated laser ablation system instantly removes the cancer cells identified by the imaging system during surgery, eliminating the need for repeat surgery.  Effective resection of cancer is often difficult because of the need to spare essential tissue (blood vessels, nerves, brain) adjacent to the tumor and the lack of visual resolution of the tumor bed during manual resection. The integrated laser ablation system developed in Phase II will enhance the surgical technique by quickly and precisely eliminating residual cancer cells in the tumor bed.  The objective of Phase II is to deliver a system ready for clinical trials, which includes: increasing the ablation speed, developing a larger field of view, and demonstrating efficacy in animal studies.  After completion of this program, Lumicell will validate the performance of the novel system in human clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from improvements in patient care and reduction of healthcare costs.  Currently, around 50% of breast cancer patients and 35% of sarcoma patients require second tumor de-bulking surgeries because a final pathology report returns days after the initial surgery indicating that residual cancerous cells have been left within the patient.  Furthermore, 25% of the final pathology reports do not detect residual cancer cells due to sampling errors fundamentally inherent in the process. Thus, most patients require subsequent medical therapy including additional radiation or chemotherapy treatment to prevent cancer recurrence and metastasis stemming from residual cancer cells.  The system is designed to find and destroy residual cancer cells in real-time at a single cell level.  Tumors adjacent to critical nerve or brain tissue are particularly difficult and a laser therapy guided by the proposed imaging system would allow the surgeon to thoroughly eradicate cancer cells with minimal added work and no adverse effect on surrounding tissue.  Lumicell's novel single cell imaging device combined with focused laser ablative therapy will have a significant impact on preventing second surgeries and subsequent medical therapy resulting in significant healthcare cost savings and improved patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will optimize and pilot test a novel, energy-positive approach to de-nitrification for the global aquaculture industry. Recirculating aquaculture systems suffer from high wastewater treatment costs. Leveraging recent advances in bio-electrochemical systems, Cambrian's de-nitrification technology is capable of simultaneously treating chemical oxygen demand (COD) at end of pipe and nitrates in culture tank water while generating electricity directly. Phase I R&D demonstrated the existence of exo-electrogenic microorganisms in aquaculture wastewater. A flow through reactor consistently treated nitrate to below EPA drinking water concentrations (10mg/L) while removing an average of 65% of end-of-pipe COD and generating over 96 Amps/m3. An economic analysis demonstrated potential operating savings of over 70%, and significant bio-security benefits, versus competing systems. Phase II R&D will focus on optimizing treatment rates and reactor parameters with partner firms, and piloting a scaled reactor at an Aquaculture farm.

    The broader impacts of this research are to introduce technologies and strategies that solve water and energy problems for the recirculating aquaculture industry. With the collapse of fisheries globally, the aquaculture industry is poised to fill an important gap in our food production. However, recirculating systems in particular are under pressure to limit environmental harm caused by water intensity and pollution. Bio-electrochemical systems represent a novel approach to turn waste resources into energy, thereby increasing farmer?s bottom line and resolving the tension between economics and sustainability. Future research can broaden applications to other industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to combine the technology for a high performance amperometric gas sensor, AGS, with the fabrication methods of printed electronics, first for sensing carbon monoxide (CO). In Phase I KWJ demonstrated a unique combination of technologies and fabricated a CO sensor that, in performance testing, was compared to commercial sensors 10-100 times larger and 10-100 times more expensive.  The new unique geometry sensor response characteristics we as good or better than commercial sensors. The printed-AGS sensor provides a general platform for sensors that is both low cost and high performance.  In Phase II, this novel Printed-CO-sensor and the process for fabrication will be optimized and innovative beta-prototypes designed and fabricated. The prototype sensors will be subjected to comprehensive testing and integrated with state-of-the-art electronics including tiny micro-powered RFID technology to demonstrate a fully compensated, high performance, yet low-cost, CO sensor and sensor system. This would represent the first major advancement of AGS technology in the USA in several decades, and the resulting product is potentially disruptive to the marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability of this novel, inexpensive printed gas sensor to combine the high performance found in the AGS technology and the modern fabrication technology from the microelectronics industry. The innovative products from this NSF SBIR can open a new landscape for sensor use. Legislative trends are pointing to a need for a low cost, high performance CO sensor.  The result of this work will be the next leap forward in the existing widely used AGSs for monitoring.   Initial impacts will include: 1] improvements in CO sensors allowing high performance home CO alarms to better protect human health as well as property, 2] widespread monitoring capability in transportation and infrastructure applications, important to both safety and homeland security; and 3] the ability to integrate gas monitoring into consumer products and create instant worldwide networks to monitor and assess for improved health and safety as well as environmental protection. The printed AGS may not only replace millions of larger sensors now sold, reducing cost and material use by 10-100X, providing a greener footprint for sensors, but also enable evolution of high performance sensing capability into new and larger markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require more modeling to be codified and bring more stakeholders into the fold. Organizations need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that are capable of handling this wider range of data, are fully accessible to non-technical users, and allow more stakeholders to participate in this important process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. On one end, spreadsheets serve as a general-purpose, ad hoc modeling tool that is open-ended and accessible for many, and on the other, whole software applications whether packaged or custom developed are generally more powerful in important ways but usually sacrifice accessibility and generalizability. This project will produce a prototype of a collaborative integrated development environment for modeling that manages code and data. The technical feasibility of this prototype will be evaluated by developing a test framework that simulates the divergence and convergence of models and scores the outcomes. The commercial feasibility will be evaluated by testing with users building real models to understand the scope of functionality required to bring this to market.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project appears in three areas.  First, there is an $8B
    dollar market for legacy hardware network security products today that is in transition
    to Software Defined Security. Adoption of this general SDSec platform has the
    potential to accelerate that market transition and improve enterprise security.
    \ Second, this project's success as an open platform could dramatically shorten
    the time between research insight and at-scale production deployments; security
    software built to a lower bar of scale/resiliency is faster and easier to build.
    The end result will be an increased rate of innovation, and new markets for niche,
    fit-for-purpose security functions that today are not profitable for vendors to
    build.  Last, this platform could harmonize enterprise security investments and
    practices for on premise workloads with security investments for public cloud
    workloads, solving a key dilemma faced by leading IT organizations. This will
    make those organizations more competitive on the world stage.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the two hardest technical
    challenges in building an enterprise-grade network security function, scale and
    resiliency, in a general way that can be applied to both new products and legacy
    codebases with no code change. Addressing scale/resiliency problems in a general
    way across many network security functions is novel, and this particular approach
    of massively parallel, lightweight packet processing functions to achieve this
    is new to this domain.  Why now? The massively parallel design proposed here is
    far too expensive and impractical with traditional hardware-based network functions.
    Even traditional hypervisor-based virtual machines carry too much hardware overhead
    to make this design cost competitive. By using vSwitches and network security
    functions packaged as Linux containers, the hardware overhead cost per instance
    drops dramatically, and this class of approach for scale/resiliency may be proven
    practical."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new approach to analyzing and understanding concisely structured documents such as legal contracts. The success of this project would provide a technological disruption in the way legal documents are processed. This will result in reduced processing time and financial savings in the review of legal contracts. Moreover, achieving this level of disruption within the legal market has the potential to open the door to automate processing, improve quality, and reduce the cost of many other legal services impacting the entire economy. With a market size of $437 Billion within the US alone, the legal industry is ready for a technological disruption that would bring this market up to par with other industries that have been significantly improved with the adoption of cutting edge Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This underlines the massive commercial potential for the technology under development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues a new innovative approach to understanding and analyzing contracts with accuracy comparable to what can be achieved by humans. Regardless of the technology, accuracy is the most important metric for lawyers to trust and adopt this innovation. Standard NLP techniques cannot generate the desired level of accuracy without a new approach to the problem.  The approach proposed for this project creates innovative custom-defined rules that operate using standard NLP technologies to break a contract into a data structure capturing different aspects of the contract meaning and allowing a higher level of understanding for the contract. In order to achieve the desired accuracy, a new innovative recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to learn over the extracted contract-meaning-data-structure which significantly improves the accuracy of the entire system. These two steps form somewhat orthogonal learning processes and when coupled with human-supervised-learning can produce the desired accuracy. This project will allow a full assessment of the underlying technology by training the core engine on a sufficiently large corpus of contracts to test the hypothesis on a larger scale.

    an environmentally benign yet highly effective marine antifouling coating for
    the American yacht market. The coating is a non-biocidal, foul release surface
    which does not require the vessel to move to obtain antifouling protection. It
    is a non-ablative multi-modal coating that will deter settling marine larvae when
    the vessel is stationary and will eliminate any attached marine organisms, such
    as barnacles through self-cleaning (e.g. fouling release) while underway. The
    commercial impact of the innovation will be in reducing consumption of non-renewable
    resources through increased fuel efficiency and possible expansion into additional
    markets. Such additional markets would include those for commercial vessels, Navy
    vessels, bridges, windmills, etc., while successfully reducing harmful chemicals
    in the marine environment. The market for these coatings is expected to double
    in the next four years, currently being at $10.2 billion. The findings from this
    development work will also be incorporated into research based educational programs.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of a promising synthetic
    conopeptide analog to the noradrenaline (NA) molecule. Prior art has shown that
    NA, when bound to a surface (or included as part of a coating covering a surface),
    deters fouling marine invertebrates from settling, thus preventing biofouling.
    Another distinct advantage of using conopeptide based systems is their stability
    in the marine environment. The current efforts are focused upon improving the
    efficacy and antifouling performance of these molecules. The phase I research
    objectives are (1) conjugation of the bioactive conopeptide additive to the current
    foul release coating; (2) demonstration of antifouling efficacy and proof of concept
    by bioassay; (3) development of batch coatings for scale-up for marine field tests.
    The results will be useful for designing new test coatings for scale up and testing
    in the marine environment."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make it cheaper and faster for architects, urban planners, and real-estate developers (APDs), as well as many others, to work with detailed models of the real world. Designers in APD fields must visualize and render their projects in the context of the real world. Pictures, videos, 3D printing, and even virtual reality inform the design process and facilitate communication with lay customers and stakeholders. These applications require consistently detailed models of the built world, and this project will automate the generation of these models. We estimate that APDs spend at least $80M annually creating these models by hand; and that at least $300M more is spent on such models for simulations, special effects, and video game design. By algorithmically generating virtual models without human intervention, the significant cost (in time and money) of manual creation will be saved, freeing design professionals to do work they want to be doing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed models of the world for diverse commercial applications. The first hurdle is solving the problem of reconstructing surfaces representing the boundaries of real-world solids (buildings) from noisy point cloud data. While surface reconstruction is well-studied in a variety of contexts, it remains an open problem in general, as successful algorithms must be informed by priors on the intended datasets. Using a data-driven approach to segment and classify input point clouds will facilitate the application of different reconstruction techniques to different objects (e.g. trees or buildings). The second hurdle is development of a machine learning algorithm which handles the dual problems of procedural modeling and inverse procedural modeling from a single statistical model, enabling visually realistic predictions about the details of a given building, even when that information is not available from source data (which may be of inconsistent quality across a large geographic area).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be large: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making; the project has the potential to make real estate sales and marketing more efficient by allowing buyers and sellers to accurately represent properties online, reducing the need for on-site visits. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second exciting effect of the proposal will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic 3D models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware, near instantaneous creation of 3D models on device, and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work might include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create a 3D model of a physical site in order to document it. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide robust, automated security protections to enterprise web applications. With the growing threat of attacks at the web application layer, security is a top of mind concern for both the developers and users of web applications. At the same time, defending against these attacks is a resource-intensive, error-prone process that typically is performed manually by specialized web security experts. The project will use application-aware analysis and an innovative information model to automatically build and deploy web security policies on enterprise servers, freeing the enterprise to focus on their core business and reduce the overhead of internal security teams. The project will also use a hybrid static/dynamic analysis to automatically craft server-side and client-side policies using modern web protection mechanisms to give users of web applications confidence that their interactions with a web application will be secure. This approach leverages cutting-edge techniques from program analysis and machine learning, and will advance the state of the art in automated security policy generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore ways in which automated security policies enact meaningful protection of sensitive resources. Protecting web applications is a challenging research problem in that automated approaches are either biased towards significant false positive rates, in which benign behavior is flagged as malicious, or significant false negative rates, in which malicious activity is not detected. This project aims to resolve this bias using application aware whitelists: the project automatically explores an application's behavior dynamically, and will also statically build a model of that application's purpose. The project is expected to yield two major components: a server-side protection module to isolate and harden sensitive resources on an enterprise deployment, and a client-side protection module to enforce fine-grained policies for users of the enterprise's web applications. The project will involve developing, analyzing, and improving both of these components using large-scale web applications and will integrate the experience and challenges of enterprises with leading web applications.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids.  In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    \ This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as Age Related Macular Degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to get American's to consume more lutein and
    zeaxanthin, which will be achieved by increasing significantly the levels of these
    antioxidants in the most widely grown staple crop: Corn. Since corn is used in
    a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving the carotenoid content
    of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of health
    benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing consumers eating
    habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically feasible, corn
    varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that are also high in
    grain yield. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop genetic markers
    for favorable alleles of genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis and stability.
    There is considerable genetic variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability, however, the most favorable alleles are typically not found in
    varieties that are commercially relevant to US corn production. Thus, the development
    of genetic markers will enable favorable alleles to be moved from lower yielding

    for the production of yield-competitive commercial F1 hybrids for the US market.
    The primary goal of this Phase I research is to create user-friendly genetic markers
    associated with favorable alleles for 12 key genes associated with carotenoid
    biosynthesis and stability. These markers will then be validated for efficacy
    by testing their ability to create progenies with higher carotenoid production,
    particularly lutein and zeaxanthin. This will result in a set of markers and experimental
    breeding materials that can be used to rapidly develop fixed inbreds for use in

    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer
    new business opportunities for small operators.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be
    used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be
    used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques
    for more effective water flooding and enhanced oil recovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project relates to the fact that the extraction and consumption of fossil carbon accounts for over 6 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.  While some mitigation approaches are fairly mature, like capturing CO2 for equestration or for enhanced oil recovery, they are very expensive in terms of both variable and capital costs and have little chance of ever providing a return on investment.  By not viewing fossil fuels and feedstocks through a circular economy lens, we estimate these companies miss an opportunity for approximately $50 billion per year in potential profit from hydrocarbons, including methanol, that could be made with waste CO2. If successful, our HI-Light reactor will enable a new economy based on the conversion of fugitive CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and solve the return on investment problem.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HI-Light, a solar-thermocatalytic "reverse combustion" technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other hydrocarbons at rate significantly greater than the state of the art. Previous approaches are limited by two roadblocks: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented, multiscale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.  The unique features of our reactor are (1) optimized light delivery to ensure that all of the catalyst material has enough light to activate the reaction and (2) an advanced nano-engineered photocatalyst which is functionalized with ligands to enhance CO2 capture and conversion.  The goal of this Phase I effort is to construct an integrated prototype reactor and evaluate its productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour and demonstrate a 10x improvement over the state of the art.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be the development of a dynamic thermal analysis system for use in aseptic food processing.  The true value of thermal properties for specific food products is required for the design of a thermal process to prevent possible bacterial contamination due to underheating, or degradation and formation of unwanted compounds due to overheating.  The proposed innovation would allow food processors to improve their understanding of thermal properties in rapid heating applications, and by validating novel food processing technologies. The impact is expected to be that the quality and nutritional value of aseptic processed foods should increase dramatically as it will eliminate the need to excessively overcook products to ensure their safety. The commercial impact of this research will be through enhancing the quality of aseptic processed food and of rapidly heated batter-based foods. As the aseptic food quality will be further enhanced compared to that of canned and frozen alternatives, this technology will also increase the growth of the rapidly growing aseptic food industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial prototype device capable of rapidly measuring the thermal properties of a material over a range of temperatures. Currently, there is no way to quickly measure properties, which are necessary for accurate modeling of rapid heating processes such as those used for aseptic food processing and for foods baked between hot irons, such as burgers. Without rapid measurement, the food product deteriorates before taking measurements. Phase I research should develop, build, and validate a physical prototype and associated software. Control and data acquisition software, along with data analysis and parameter estimation software, will be finalized and validated. The device will be tested against materials with known parameters to statistically validate its performance and accuracy. Finally the device will be tested alongside the prior state-of-the-art to compare its performance to the industry standard. The product of this research will be a commercially-viable prototype that has been validated against literature values and has been demonstrated to outperform current devices. The device will be able to measure parameters over a range of temperatures more accurately and in a fraction of the time of current methodology.

- abstractText: "This SBIR phase I project will provide a unique computational capability
    to additive manufacturing (AM) designers, engineers, and technicians for making
    better decisions with regards to metal 3D printing. Through AM, one can fabricate
    complex parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. Perfecting an AM
    process is however non-trivial, entailing time-consuming and expensive shop-floor
    experimentation. For example, fabricating a typical hand-sized component on a
    metal AM machine can take several hours to complete, costing thousands of dollars.
    Consequently, there is significant interest today to replace experiments with
    computer simulation. But AM simulations today require massively parallel computer
    clusters, such as those available only at national labs. This has largely deterred
    industrial progress and innovation. The proposed research has the potential to
    yield an algorithmically  advanced AM simulation program that can run on standard
    desktop workstations without loss of accuracy. An environmental impact of this
    SBIR proposal is that by promoting virtual simulation of AM, the amount of wasted
    material will be minimized. \n\nThe proposed research lies at the intersection
    of computational mechanics, and manufacturing. It proposes to develop a novel
    computational approach to additive manufacturing simulation that bypasses the
    memory bottleneck observed in traditional finite element analysis (FEA). By using
    a voxel representation where all elements are congruent (i.e. possess a rigid
    transformation symmetry) and have identical material properties, the memory requirements
    can be reduced dramatically and thereby speed up the simulation by orders of magnitude
    compared to traditional FEA software. Similar approach has been successfully demonstrated
    for problems in structural mechanics and topology optimization. The proposal aims
    to extend the approach to in-process AM simulation where G-code will be used to
    identify elements in a heat affected zone for laser and electron beam based processes,
    and the congruent elements will be identified for each phase in the process to
    reduce simulation time."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by satellite-based positioning systems like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-meter location accuracy within large GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive AC wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail and manufacturing all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost RF tags to better than 1 meter of accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to scale this localization technology so that it can support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of scalable multiple access protocols for ultrasound communication, networking protocols for synchronization and data collection, inertial sensor fusion algorithms for robust and accurate localization and APIs for app integration by third parties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes high quality data that indicates a population?s sense of well-being and environmental safety--two essential factors in the effort for long-term sustainability. MindRider and Multimer collect and analyze human signals at the neighborhood, town, city, and regional scale, thus providing proactive, standardized, geospatial, real-time information to improve both personal mobility and urban monitoring. MindRider and Multimer can help overcome limitations in two prevalent monitoring methods: 1) A reactive methodology for quantifying danger is to count accidents. While government-collected accident data is often reliable and includes many years' worth of information, it does not provide precise spatial details such as direction of movement. Most importantly, an injury or fatality must occur before a statistic is produced, which therefore misses all the non-reported minor injuries, as well as perceptions of danger. 2) Many researchers use qualitative instruments like surveys and interviews to study perceptions of safety without the occurrence of an accident But while qualitative methods are highly valuable, these methods cannot be deployed continuously, are often not geospatial, and their results may not be standardized.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges that stakeholders like transportation planners and real estate analysts encounter as they monitor rapid change in cities and towns. For these stakeholders, improved data helps to reduce the complexity, cost, and risk of site selection decisions like choosing the location for a store, transit hub, outdoor advertisement, home, or office. Existing location analysis tools show similar kinds of evaluations for very different neighborhoods, based on limited data that doesn't often change. MindRider, which pairs custom ergonomic biosensors with GPS-enabled smartphones to record EEG and location data, and Multimer, which categorizes and analyzes MindRider data against existing geographic inputs, has the potential to provide key insights for data-driven decision making. We have built the basic system to collect and analyze geolocated biosensor data and have proven the technical feasibility of collecting these data from a pilot sample population for an extended period of time. Our primary objective for Phase I is to improve our data modeling and analysis--with a focus on affective interpretation, biosensor comparison, geospatial and temporal statistics, and reproducibility--so as to offer a fully robust product that stakeholders will confidently integrate into their existing workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop an analysis software package to significantly reduce health care costs while simultaneously improving patient care by helping select the correct treatment for each patient. Every year an estimated of 1.4 million women undergo unnecessary treatments at a cost to society of $32.2 billion for breast cancer. At the same time, some patients do not receive the treatment they need. For instance, chemotherapy is not routinely recommended after surgical tumor removal for patients with early stage lung cancer, even though the disease will recur in a large number of them. The ability to correctly identify disease subtypes and patient subgroups is a pre-condition to the ability to distinguish between patients that need the most aggressive treatments, and those who will never progress or recur. Further, the proposed approach can improve the results of clinical trials. With an estimated 2,300 Phase III clinical trials per year in the US, a full 50% of them are destined for failure with a loss of $1 billion/year. This can be avoided if the correct inclusion criteria are defined, and the drug is administered only to the people most likely to respond.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel software package able to identify subtypes of disease based on the integration of multiple types of omics data. Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients and/or subtypes of disease. Many attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success so far. In addition, very few approaches are able to combine multiple data types and most of the time the analysis of each data type leads to different subgroups that are very hard to interpret. The technology proposed here will be able to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple types of high-throughput data such as mRNAs, miRNAs, methylation, etc. The goal of this project is to implement this technology as a software package that will facilitate its application in large scale consistent with real-world use. In addition, the plan is to assess the feasibility of this technology by performing an extensive comparison with the top three existing approaches:  Consensus clustering, similarity network fusion, and iClusterPlus using over 1,800 real patient data from 12 different studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create an economical, high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer mounted to a consumer drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to allow testing of air for the presence of harmful compounds over a specific geographical location. A frequency domain THz spectrometer is capable of characterizing many different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample. Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because of their size and complexity. However, recent advancements have made it possible to build a lightweight spectrometer that can be mounted to a drone. This is significant because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. chemical warfare agents or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local environment. The THz Drone will allow immediate and accurate detection of many harmful compounds in the air.

    The proposed project will demonstrate a compact, battery operated, frequency domain THz photomixing spectrometer that is capable of Doppler limited molecular spectroscopy and is constructed predominantly from economical off-the-shelf fiber optic components in a highly compact, light-weight form factor. The brass-board instrument will incorporate an optical phase-modulation technique to remove the effects of coherent detection and it will have a greater than 2 THz bandwidth with a spectral purity of better than 100 kHz. After construction, the instrument will be employed to measure Doppler limited molecular transitions of carbon dioxide mixed with water vapor. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument, a first-draft design for an integrated system weighing less than 3 kg and capable of being carried with a consumer drone will be generated as will a larger laboratory version of the instrument.

    will improve the accessibility, cost, and effectiveness of index-based insurance
    contracts, which provide businesses with crucial financial relief from the droughts
    and floods that hamper their operations. Such contracts also create new investment
    opportunities with diversification benefits for investors. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to overcome the technical challenges
    of seamlessly and scalably 1) combining and analyzing massive heterogeneous datasets
    relevant to hydrologic-financial risks, 2) managing a diverse set of models that
    cover hydrology, industrial operations, markets, and actuarial sciences, and 3)
    optimizing the configuration of data and models to generate accurate and precise
    risk indices. This project will construct and test a unified semantic data model
    for hydrologic-financial risk and deploy optimizations to maximize accuracy of
    the indices for a specific industrial use case. The architecture allows for the
    automated provisioning of disparate datasets and the deployment of best-in-class
    modeling and optimization tools to generate detailed risk indices. The research
    will create new vocabulary, when necessary, to bridge the gaps between existing
    ontologies in hydrology, industrial asset operations, actuarial analysis, and
    financial market conditions. If successful, the research will enable a dramatic
    reduction in both the time and cost required to produce hydrologic-financial risk
    analyses and the instances of errors in those analyses."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network infrastructure in data center networks.  While modern data centers leverage server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments in the lab have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The goal of this project is to run in a production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced with production conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve occupational safety and health outcomes within the fire service through translational research and development of an affordable wearable physiologic monitoring device. Nearly 50% of firefighter line of duty deaths are the result of sudden cardiovascular events and the societal costs of firefighter injuries are in the billions of dollars, yet many departments cannot afford the costs of implementing the firefighter monitoring programs. Therefore, the use of an affordable wearable which can gather, store and transmit physiological data in real-time has the potential to reduce fatalities, injuries and costs. The affordability of manufacturing the device is the major commercial innovation as it will extend the physiological monitoring capability to workers exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as firefighters, soldiers, chemical and biological lab technicians, and commercial drivers - groups that have not been able to afford the cost of longitudinal and/or real-time physiological monitoring and predictive diagnostics. The affordability of the device will enable researchers to further scientific knowledge correlating the interrelationship between experimental physiological monitoring and field-based data.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from improving the efficiency in facilities
    management (FM) of institutional and commercial buildings by enabling a streamlined
    transition to efficient, proactive operations using the power of big data analytics.
    This provides an opportunity to reduce estimated $78.5 Billion - $127.3 Billion
    in waste due to reactive maintenance per year in the US commercial facilities
    market alone.  A data driven, proactive approach provides a unique opportunity
    that enable facilities managers to assess as-is conditions of assets, avoid non
    value-add activities and plan maintenance tasks to avoid failures and shutdown.
    This will contribute towards transforming a traditional industry to an advanced
    data-driven one.  It will also enable significant reduction in the disruptions
    caused to occupants due to failures in facilities.  Given that Americans spend
    85-90% of their time indoors and any disruptions caused by facilities directly
    impact their qualities of lives, the broader societal impact of reducing failures
    in facilities is significant.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project intends to research, develop and demonstrate the feasibility
    of using big data analytics and machine learning to transform facilities operations
    and maintenance decisions. Owners and operators of the over five million commercial
    and institutional buildings in the United States are faced with the challenges
    of managing aging and crowded building infrastructure. They waste between 30%
    and 40% of resources by operating in a predominantly inefficient, reactive mode.
    This project targets development of computational mechanisms that automatically
    analyze integrated building information to identify patterns that lead to actionable
    insights that help reduce non value-add activities and improve resource utilization
    in FM daily operation and planning. By combining advanced machine learning technologies
    with existing building information modeling (BIM) resources, the company is proposing
    to develop high-impact, statistical and visual methods for optimizing the decision-making
    abilities of facility managers and with that, the performance of critical facilities
    infrastructure and maintenance crews.  The results of this research will include
    algorithms and methods to normalize heterogeneous building data, detect patterns
    and anomalies, from which actionable insights can be derived with domain knowledge,
    and generate qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision
    making in managing commercial facilities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a wearable alcohol monitoring device to the general population which will lead to a better awareness about alcohol consumption, and ultimately enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce burden of illness and disability. Incautious alcohol use causes health and social problems that either manifest over time due to sustained drinking (e.g., heart disease, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, etc.), or are short term effects of acute intoxication and/or impaired decision-making (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, violence, etc.). Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths per year in the United States from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy approximately $224 billion. In light of the above social impact, the proposed graphene based wearable alcohol monitoring device addresses the urgent need to implement health approaches to reduce the loss of life and the huge economic costs that result from excessive drinking. In fact, the growing need for personalized health-care is highlighted by the estimated market size of $19 billion for wearable biosensors by 2018, pointing towards the potential commercial opportunity for self-monitoring alcohol sensors as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the unmet need for a small, light, unobtrusive, convenient-to-use alcohol sensor for real-time self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol consumption is a health risk behavior and the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Most strategies to improve safe drinking rely on obtaining accurate and timely information about alcohol consumption; these include self-report of number and timing of drinks, breathalyzers, blood analysis by lab, and wearable devices. Wearable alcohol monitors have clear advantages in terms of accuracy and feasibility compared to other methods for self-monitoring. However, current wearable devices for alcohol monitoring are bulky, inconvenient to use, obtrusive, and do not provide consistent, real-time data on the level of intoxication. In this Phase II SBIR project, a stand-alone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor integrated with calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver will be developed, tested and benchmarked on a large group of recruited adult volunteers. Good correlation between the graphene sensor and a legal grade breathalyzer in large-scale human tests will confirm the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed sensors, which can then be shipped to early adopters, pitched to investors, and ultimately introduced for sales.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower farmers to capture a greater share of revenue from the marketing of their crops.  Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas.  Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain.  We have developed a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions.  Whereas improved agronomy could raise yields by 5-10%, improved marketing could raise revenue >25%, especially for high value crops.  In addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by our platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs.  Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a completely novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions.  We have bundled a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data.  These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management.   Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future.  Our research objective here will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast.  This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the performance of the computational back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a software platform for the engineering of living systems. Specifically, it will complete a software ecosystem that builds upon a core set of computational tools for the specification, design, build, test, analyze, and archive activities in synthetic biology and couple them with a rich set of interfaces to expert services (e.g., DNA synthesis, data analysis). The proposed work involves the completion of state-of-the-art design approaches and algorithms and couples it with the ability to create customized, modular workflows based on genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway modification, and genome engineering. The proposed work advances computational approaches in synthetic biology as well as innovating in the way that software services are monetized with biotechnology companies. The anticipated result of this work is a commercial software package and associated service agreements that can be deployed to both large and small biotechnology companies fundamentally changing the way that synthetic biology designs are conceived, designed, and physically created.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a software platform where the goal is to combine bio-design automation (BDA) software with explicitly integrated access to expert services in a workflow-driven software ecosystem.  The creation of novel living systems using biotechnology to engineer new medicines, materials, and fuels is frequently an ad-hoc process involving long iteration cycles, wasted resources, and sub-optimal designs. The software will allow for the automated specification, design, fabrication, test, and archival of complete plans for the engineering of novel engineered biological systems. This software includes mechanisms for specifying biological "rules," DNA assembly strategies, and automated generation of robotic instructions.  In particular, this effort will focus on the creation of genetic circuits, engineered metabolic pathways, and genome engineering.  The approach provides tools representing state-of-the-art advances in BDA while introducing novel methods of interacting with a large, diverse set of expert service providers. Further, the approach will empower novice experimentalists while enabling expert computational engineers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific need for operational synthesis of spatially consistent and temporally relevant historical and current high resolution satellite imagery for analytical purposes. The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

- abstractText: "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling more efficient Annual Wind Energy Production (AEP) while reducing the cost of energy (COE). This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

    This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it having far-reaching societal, commercial, and technological impact. (1) Initial research by the Principal Investigator on analyzing the energy drain of AngryBirds has demonstrated the severe energy inefficiency of popular mobile apps in today's app market. The importance of this work is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the "digital divide". (2) Commercially, the project will foster a paradigm shift in the mobile app industry ($101B industry in 2020) from the current feature-centric to energy-aware app design. Such a paradigm shift will have a significant, long lasting impact on the app industry. Energy-efficient apps lead to longer battery life, which in turn leads to longer user engagement time, which ultimately translates into millions of dollars of increased mobile revenue as all major businesses are shifting towards mobile. Hence this SBIR project will lead to a marketable product. (3) Technically, the proposed work will extend the performance profiling technology that is foundational to the software industry into the energy dimension, which is critical to the mobile software industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the industry's first app energy management (AEM) solution to help app developers reduce app battery drain, and extend the battery life of billions of smartphones. The research objectives are (1) to develop advanced energy debugging techniques that can automatically identify energy drain opportunities from legitimate energy hotspots; and (2) to develop an SDK-based app energy monitoring system for monitoring app energy drain when running on consumer phones in the open market. These objectives pose significant technical challenges. While similar challenges on performance metrics (such as running time) have been well studied for traditional software, in particular in high-performance computing, in this project the company is expanding them to the energy dimension for the mobile app industry, which has not been attempted before. The company will develop novel machine-learning based solutions to learn, classify, and auto-detect energy optimization opportunities. As a result it expects to develop the first set of solutions to these fundamental challenges in optimizing the energy drain of millions of mobile apps in the app market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living
    in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.
    \ The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6:
    Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery
    life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments
    by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium
    angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that
    do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The
    amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each
    week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal
    impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb
    amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally,
    because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able
    to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic
    and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive
    ankle prostheses.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2
    project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer
    from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased
    reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with
    increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground
    walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve
    a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint,
    adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range
    of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground
    and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally
    and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will
    be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the
    device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing
    on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being
    simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the
    first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive
    test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material
    properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate
    tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline
    transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of
    the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and
    leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission
    pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked
    to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary
    strength data.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during
    the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets
    can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable
    within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic
    pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the
    asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. \n\nThe overall
    technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research
    and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system
    integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable
    nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data.
    The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling
    the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test
    units.  Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field
    environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone
    2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion
    of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services.
    \ Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the
    system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall
    goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to
    enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes,
    potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and
    Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable
    compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating
    shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists
    expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.
    \ Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety
    with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple
    information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is
    made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs,
    hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected
    patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase
    I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management
    that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.
    \ Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications
    and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and
    potentially saving lives.  \n\n\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded
    label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide
    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will lead to more numerous and healthier

    a reduction in energy use; improvement in air and water quality; increased carbon

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to establish the viability of a drug
    delivery platform that employs an engineered strain of Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis,
    a common skin commensal bacterium, that can secrete therapeutic proteins of interest
    for the ultimate goal of treating skin disease.  An ointment with an inoculum
    of such bacteria could be infrequently applied to skin, providing constant, low-cost,
    convenient delivery of therapeutic protein in situ. This study proposes proof-of-concept
    studies to demonstrate that an engineered strain of S. epidermidis can serve as
    a modular, biological drug delivery chassis that can be modified to treat a range
    of skin conditions, beginning with atopic dermatitis, Netherton Syndrome, and
    lamellar ichthyosis. These conditions represent significant commercial opportunities
    spanning both common and rare diseases, and provide validation for a generalized
    engineered platform of skin bacteria with broad potential applicability to different
    skin disorders of multifaceted origin, including genetic, inflammatory, and infectious
    disorders. Validation of the proposed targets provides the crucial data necessary
    to attract the talent and investment necessary to build an innovative, diversified
    skin care company. \n\nThis project is highly innovative because it proposes using
    commensal skin microbes to secrete and deliver therapeutic proteins or enzymes
    that are either missing or could be beneficial in treating certain skin diseases.
    Current treatment options for many skin diseases aim for symptomatic relief and
    fail to address underlying pathophysiological changes leading to skin disease.
    Approaches using direct topical supplementation of purified protein are limited
    by poor subcutaneous localization to sites of need, production and purification
    costs, and a requirement for constant application. The proposed Phase I research
    plan will establish for the first time that (1) commensal bacteria can serve as
    tunable and highly potent drug delivery systems in the skin; (2) skin commensal
    bacteria can be manipulated to express and export a therapeutic protein of interest;
    and (3) commensal bacteria engineered to expresses heterologous proteins can colonize
    skin stably. This project will be executed using both standard molecular biology
    tools such as cloning and spectrophotometric analysis as well as advanced methods
    in confocal imaging and synthetic biology. Together, these studies will establish
    a new paradigm in drug delivery mechanisms for the treatment of skin diseases,
    which can also be extended to delivery of broad array of agents to promote skin

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be in the area of optical materials. Optical materials are widely used in applications such as eyeglasses, cameras, cell phones, fiber-optic cables etc. Novol aims to push the frontiers of innovation in optical material research by creating new polymers with a much better balance of optical properties relative to glass while being tough and lightweight. The goal is to provide significant improvement in vision quality for patients with ophthalmic disorders. Particular benefit could be seen in pediatric and hyperopic prescription markets where choices of lens materials are restricted due to greater demand on lens properties. Long term project goals will focus on making lower-cost and more efficient lens assemblies for imaging, diagnostics and surveillance applications. A parallel aim of the research is to reduce the environmental impact of existing optical polymers, which are often made from highly toxic materials. Commercial opportunity presented through this work will not only benefit the end users but also the lens manufacturers through its ability to utilize safe and bio-derived monomers like sugars for making a highly important category of materials in today?s markets.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate optical and mechanical advantages of a new class of polymers made from sugars. Sugars have versatile properties arising from their complex structures, presence of heteroatoms and multiple functional groups. This research aims to bring together principles of organic, polymer and biological chemistry to create a new type of highly transparent, strong and refractive polymers useful in many optical applications, including lenses. Recent innovation in optical materials has focused largely on increasing a singular lens property, refractive index, mainly to afford thinner lenses for prescription eyewear applications. Technical objectives of this work go beyond the need to create just high index optical polymers and focus on making polymers that balance high refractive index with other critical properties of optical materials such as low dispersion of light and desirable mechanical strength. Lens materials with such well-balanced properties are currently unknown and if created, will provide unique advantages for many commercial applications of lenses such as prescription eyewear, sports accessories, camera assemblies and device screens. Another technical objective of this effort will focus on co-polymerization of sugar derivatives with known synthetic polymers to improve the properties and bio-based content of existing polymers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will lie in the improved ability to accurately monitor indoor and outdoor airborne particles using the proposed low-cost, broad size-range, aerosol  sensor to be developed in this research project. Inhalation of aerosol particles can result in adverse human health effects, with the critical parameter from a health effect perspective being the concentration of particles smaller than 2.5µm, i.e. PM2.5. Measurements of PM2.5 are critical to understand the extent of particulate exposure that populations experience in different environments. This project?s proposed approach is to measure particle concentrations by charging them and sensing their abundance using sensitive low-current circuits. This approach allows for measurements over a broad size range and at low-cost. Most of the currently available aerosol sensors are only sensitive to particles larger than ~ 500 nm, and hence are unreliable for ambient measurements. The proposed sensor will, thus, likely generate a significant interest in the aerosol research community and the ambient air quality monitoring industry.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate aerosol concentration measurements over a size range of 10 nm to 2.5 µm using an electrical-sensing technique. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the novel combination of electrical-mobility aerosol classification, printed electrodes, low-current sensing electronics, and advanced inversion algorithms to result in a low-cost real-time, wide size-range, aerosol sensor. With printed electrodes, the signal response from the sensor can be tailored to be proportional to total particle volume concentration, and, thus, to PM2.5. The research objectives are to demonstrate the accuracy of volume concentration measurements made with our sensor for a range of particle types and size distributions. The successful completion of this project should result in a prototype sensor that can accurately measure total aerosol concentrations in different ambient conditions. This would be a first critical step towards the final development of a low-cost sensor for large-scale air quality measurements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable affordable access to quantum annealing quantum computers and to take the complexity out of the programming and application hosting tasks, which currently poses a major barrier of entry for potential users. The company expects quantum computing technology in the next few years to disrupt significant portions of the high-performance-computing environment for optimization problems, which has previously been characterized by slow and incremental performance improvements. This project would yield a platform that both increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of analyzing complex optimization problems, which could spur fast-paced innovation in wide areas of the economy that tackle such issues. These sectors include energy distribution, pharmaceutical design, cancer research, data analytics, cybersecurity, autonomous systems, planning and scheduling activities, financial services such as risk management and portfolio optimization, and basic and applied research in physics and chemistry.  In each of these disciplines, there are optimization-based computational problems that are currently intractable. The results of this research should enable a much larger community of experts to use the power of quantum computing to solve these important but currently intractable problems.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the need for a cloud-based platform for using quantum annealing computing technology. Quantum annealing computers have come to market in the last few years, and research laboratories and universities have used these machines to explore algorithms that could eventually be solved efficiently on them. Despite advances in performance of quantum annealing computers, little effort has been directed toward developing programming environments and tools that provide simple and inexpensive access to quantum computing capabilities. This project researches a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) with a suite of front-end and back-end tools that efficiently transform high-level computing problems into binary optimization formulations suitable for quantum annealing, simplifying and automating the low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to perform useful calculations. This project will further develop the PaaS to include a classical-quantum computing environment and framework for analysis of large data sets using standard distributed computing tools. The research explores the best software tools and platform methods to integrate emerging quantum computing capabilities into workflows by streamlining and making affordable the processing of data and by decomposing real-world problems into sub-problems amenable to quantum computers of today and in the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be commercially deployable equipment for screening, detecting, and removing aflatoxin contaminated corn from the global food supply. Exposure to aflatoxin, a dangerous fungal carcinogen, has been linked to liver cancer, childhood stunting, illness and death in humans and animals, and major economic losses for farmers and grain handlers in the U.S. and globally. Rapid batch screening equipment will expand the capacity of the grain industry to test more corn for aflatoxin contamination and minimize the high sampling error that currently plagues the aflatoxin testing process and risks greater contamination exposure downstream. In addition to batch screening equipment, opportunities also exist to develop handheld devices to identify contaminated corn in the field, and continuous flow optical sorters, deployed at grain handling and food processing facilities, to remove the contaminated corn and protect the market value of the healthy grain. The goal is to 1) Increase revenue for farmers in the U.S. and globally; 2) Protect the food supply and reduce the risks of greater contamination exposure for farmers, grain handlers, and consumers; and 3) Protect feed supply and improve productivity of livestock.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a specialized high resolution imaging system for rapid batch screening of aflatoxin in corn.  The research team will build the prototype unit and image processing software with the patented algorithm for detection of aflatoxin in corn, integrated with a high resolution, dual-camera system. With existing chemical tests for aflatoxin detection, it is difficult for grain handlers to test larger samples or every truck without causing major delays in operations. The key technical hurdle for rapid batch screening with this technology is reliable imaging analysis of sufficient size samples, screened fast enough for the imaging system to fit into commercial grain handling operations without disruption.  By screening hundreds of corn samples with the rapid batch screening prototype unit, the team will validate device accuracy of >95% true positive and true negative for detection of corn contaminated with aflatoxin, consistently across contamination ranges and proportions, at a processing speed fast enough to be deployed by commercial grain handlers on every truckload.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, and of its underlying technological innovation, is in enabling a diverse variety of applications involving interactive and immersive media, which are central to several sectors that are poised to grow substantially in the coming years. Specifically, the low-latency audio technology developed in the project is a critical enabler for the development of future products that are of significant value to several sectors of the technology industry including, most importantly, the enabling of fully immersive interactive media products for augmented reality games and related applications. Additional impact is expected in the advancement and support of musical collaboration over the internet and enabling remote music education, both with clear cultural and educational implications. Another significant impact is in enabling a truly realistic teleconferencing experience with considerable implications for both business and social networks, with the latter further providing a realistic alternative to fully interactive social gatherings of groups and families without recourse to costly travel.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a novel paradigm for coding and networking of polyphonic audio content at low-latency via efficient prediction, which is critical to numerous applications in the emerging field of interactive immersive hyper-realistic multimedia. Polyphonic audio, or the mixture of multiple periodic components plus noise, has long resisted effective prediction, thus forcing state-of-the-art coders to either employ long transformation that incurs substantial delay and is incompatible with applications requiring low latency, low complexity and low bitrate, or accept significantly degraded performance. This project develops technologies that approach optimal performance despite constraints on latency, complexity and bit rate, by effectively exploiting temporal redundancies in all periodic components of polyphonic audio signals. Specifically, the coding paradigm builds on the novel technique of cascaded long term prediction, which enables joint prediction of all periodic components in the mixture, at low delay. This prediction approach is complemented by the development of powerful low-complexity parameter estimation techniques to minimize resource requirements, effective adaptation to fundamental frequency changes, side information optimization to minimize bitrate costs, practical redesign of all coder modules to fully exploit the prediction capabilities, and enhanced error-resilience for streaming over lossy packet networks.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will address drug resistance in cancer
    patients through the advanced analysis of biopsies.  Not only is each patient
    unique but their tumor contains a high level of genetic diversity as well. Overlooked
    diversity within patient tumors can lead to inadequate treatment and consequently
    acquired drug resistance, and has also been shown to predict therapeutic response
    to certain drugs.  The proposed technology is capable of extracting and correlating
    tumor gene expression profiles to the spatial information and imaging of a biopsy
    so that a physical map of genetic diversity can be constructed.  The initial application
    of this method will be in immuno-oncology where the spatial locations of immune
    cells fighting cancer have been shown to predict response to treatment. The next
    step will be to elucidate all cell types in the specimen that are usually overlooked
    with conventional diagnostics and use this information for determining treatment
    combinations that would affect all types of malignant cells found in this tumor.
    This directly addresses the Cancer Moonshot Initiative's focus on combination
    treatments for personalized medicine.  Successful commercialization of this method
    will result in drug biomarker discovery services, precision screening for patients,
    and fundamental discoveries in biology by researchers using this tool to investigate
    various diseases.  \n\nThe technical innovation in this SBIR Phase I Project is
    the ability to correlate genomic analysis with spatial information to create an
    in-situ map of gene expression across the specimen.  Imaging and big genomic data
    such as sequencing have been mutually exclusive, and the ability to correlate
    them in order to visualize genetic diversity within a specimen would be informative
    for both screening and research.  The goals of this project are to demonstrate
    the ability to create a visual heat map of gene expression from archived biopsies
    and to show that this expression map identifies genetic diversity that standard
    analysis methods do not.  Quantification of this diversity and the locations of
    deviations in the tumor will be the basis of future screenings for drug responsiveness
    as well as basic research into the causes and treatments of various diseases."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of an inexpensive way to create projected displays on arbitrary surfaces. This can have a tremendous impact in the ease of deployment and maintenance of low cost high-resolution displays on existing common surfaces (e.g. walls, pillars, objects, whiteboards) as well as prototyped (3D printed, clay, or Lego) models. This opportunity can dove-tail well with the maker-movement that democratizes manufacturing, artistic creation, and design. All of the benefits of the maker movement for society, the economy, commerce, and education will multiply with the introduction of an inexpensive and easy to use technology for creating displays on arbitrary surfaces. New markets that are constrained due to the cost of current solutions will open up for adopting this low-cost technology. Such markets include elementary schools in need of collaborative interactive devices, mobile planetariums, inflatable temporary display structures for independent artists, and others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a completely automated solution to create seamless imagery using multiple projectors on an arbitrarily shaped surface. Additionally, the project aims to enable multi-user interaction with this multi-projector display on an arbitrarily shaped surface. The company is proposing to develop software that uses a distributed network of computers, projectors, and cameras to respectively drive, project, and observe the projected light on the display in order to automatically compute (a) the position, orientation, and color parameters of the cameras and projectors, and (b) the shape of the display surface. This automated process will operate by the push of a button and take a few seconds to minutes depending on the complexity of the geometry of the display surface. Using this computed information the system will (i) perform real-time image correction to register multiple projected images and thereby create a seamless display that looks as though it is being projected from a single projector; and (b) handle interactions of multiple users with the display appropriately.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to bring positive impactful changes to the economy, society, and scientific/technological understanding through intelligent voice-enabled technology. Commercially, the introduction of an intelligent, ultra-low power, embedded voice trigger will capture an important portion of the $113 billion global voice and speech recognition market, contributing to its expansion and that of related markets such as wearables and Internet of Things (IoT). The long-term potential impact is broad and encompasses the key players in the voice recognition ecosystem such as the mobile phone industry, semiconductor companies, chip designers, technology providers and system integrators, who will be enabled to innovate with the proposed platform. Societally, the day-to-day lives of users will be made easier by empowering them through the faster and natural use of speech commands to access device functionality and to retrieve processed information in real time. Furthermore, by performing onboard speech processing, the proposed technology alleviates many societal issues and challenges surrounding privacy and data protection with cloud-based solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an always-on, touch-free, embedded voice trigger with ultra-low power consumption for deployment in smart products and IoT systems. This novel speech processing technology transforms analog speech signals into biologically-inspired data-efficient binary pulse trains and processes them using adaptive state models. These models can be deployed in a network of reprogrammable automata with high accuracy using only the timing information of the digital pulses produced by the user's voice. Compared with conventional speech features, pulse trains, as used in the human auditory system, are highly robust to noise and lead to extremely small footprint hardware implementations, which are ideally suited for low power on-chip processing. Furthermore, by processing only ones and zeros with automata, the proposed approach requires no arithmetic, enabling real-time, complex voice processing capability that would otherwise be achieved at prohibitive costs or be relegated to the cloud. This keyword spotting technology is pre-configurable, customized for each user, and can be used in cellphones or similar portable devices with no network connection required after calibration. It offers increased security and privacy to access portable device features by eliminating the need to send potentially sensitive data continuously online.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve critical power budget issues in next generation wearable computing applications. Candidate applications require ultra-low power, require massive context-awareness computation, and need to perform in the noisy real world.  A large gap exists between consumer expectation and what can be realized using conventional circuit techniques. Reconfigurable and biologically inspired classifiers use proprietary mixed signal approaches that uniquely close wearable computing's power/performance gap.  Our Phase I deliverables focus on completing a minimum viable product (MVP) that will use gesture recognition to wake up/control behavior of a wearable device with a power budget in the low micro-watt range.  The demonstration would use programmable neural classifier engines acting on sensor stimulus to perform gesture recognition. This important step will allow the further development of the technology portfolio for a broader range of applications.

    The proposed project's central innovation lies in the mixed-signal approach to embedded computing to shatter the energy efficiency barrier of traditional digital systems. The Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) approach incorporates neuromorphic circuits which approach 5GMAC/uW processing efficiency for high-level classification tasks. The Long-term vision is to address a broad range of end applications through a family of mixed signal integrated circuits based on a novel and programmable architecture that operates at 2 orders of magnitude less power than a comparable digital implementation; to deliver solutions that are the world's most energy efficient implementation. When classification tasks which formerly required at least 10mW to perform can be accomplished within 100uW, a vast range of applications become possible. The impact will be most profoundly felt in the design of next generation portable devices- in particular complex event tracking functions in wireless sensor motes (enabling the Internet-of-Things (IoT)), next generation devices for wearable computing.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a non-invasive imaging technology to help save the vision of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision loss in the US and worldwide. The American Diabetes Association estimates that DR causes $98 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses annually. DR is a complication of both type I and II diabetes and results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Recent studies have demonstrated that small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation are a reliable indicator of pre-stage and early-stage DR -- before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of achieving such a high resolution, a major need exists for the development of advanced retinal oximetry technologies with demonstrated clinical utility. This project aims to meet this major need based on a novel approach to functional imaging, thereby improving the lives of U.S. citizens and reducing the devastating economic impact of DR. By mitigating its occurrence, the technology developed as a result of this project will help reduce the cost of DR treatment and its overall economic burden.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a non-invasive imaging technology to provide high-resolution retinal oxygen saturation maps of diabetic patients in one snapshot. There are no existing commercial technologies with these capabilities; the proposed technology is a first-of-its-kind effort. Compared with existing methods, the successful outcome of this project can become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. This non-invasive, instantaneous and easy-to-use biophotonics technology will aid in both the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy. This project's scope includes three parts. First, bench-scale studies will validate the innovative, physics-based concept and algorithm proposed as the basis of the technology. Second, a prototype will be developed and tested. Finally, the technology prototype will be validated in a clinical setting to establish the utility and effectiveness of the technology in an actual operating environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to attempt to close what has been called the "largest financial protection gap in the world," the impact of a large U.S. earthquake on a major population center. The public is woefully unprepared for the consequences of such an event, banking on government assistance rather than personal resilience. In California alone, there are 3-4 million uninsured seismically vulnerable homes and 1 million uninsured vulnerable businesses. Of 1-3 million homes in need of strengthening, only about 20,000 are seismically retrofitted each year. Part of the problem is that insurance companies calculate the likelihood of a payout for a policy, but homeowners cannot, so homeowners lack the means to act in their own best financial interests. The free and ad-free mobile app under development for this project uses public data and methods to explain a home's seismic risk and to show the benefits of buying a seismically safer home, retrofitting an older home, or purchasing earthquake insurance. Most important, it does so without scaring, soothing, or snowing the user. Homebuyers can use the app at open houses and also at the residences of family members.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has three principle objectives: (1) The seismic hazard estimates will account not only for earthquake shaking, but also for whether a home lies on a steep slope or in a liquefaction, landslide, or fault zone, which increase the damage potential. With this enhancement, insurance will be more economical than retrofit in some locations because it is expensive to retrofit in a landslide or liquefaction zone. (2) The technology will combine several real-time data streams to predict the earthquakes that app users have just felt, notifying them within tens of seconds. With this feature, the company aims to provide the fastest, most personalized, most useful, and most accurate earthquake notifications ever achieved. (3) The app will include a global earthquake forecast, so that anyone on Earth with a mobile phone can learn their earthquake exposure. This forecast is based on the first and only independently tested, published, and globally uniform earthquake occurrence model. App users can learn about the largest earthquake they are likely to experience in their lifetime, and how to take action to protect themselves and their families.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to various cyberattacks. Furthermore, the proposed tool can allow organizations to audit big data usage to prevent abuse and misuse of the stored data. The existence of such a novel tool may increase trust in these big data management systems, and protect the sensitive data stored in such systems against various outsider and insider attacks. The company believes that such a tool would address an important customer need and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data management technologies such as Hadoop and Spark. The company plans to pursue a freemium business model and open source some of the developed code. This in turn may improve the data protection capabilities provided by existing freely available open source tools that can be used by many different companies and organizations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove the feasibility of a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool.  This new tool will provide enhanced security and privacy protection capabilities such as enforcing privacy policies using on-the-fly data masking, enforcing security policies using role-based access control techniques, and enforcing governance policies using data encryption, and advanced auditing and accountability features in one tool without the need to modify/change the underlying big data management system. To successfully develop the proposed prototype, the company will address many technical challenges such as developing efficient privacy-preserving policy enforcement solutions with very little overhead, and designing an interactive user interface that supports easy governance and privacy policy specification tasks. To address these technical challenges, the company proposes to leverage recent advances in aspect oriented programming to inject code directly into submitted data analysis jobs in a seamless manner to enable transparent data encryption, data sanitization, and accountability, compliance and governance policy enforcement. Using this injected code, the data that is stored in encrypted format could be decrypted and sanitized before it is used for data analysis as needed. Furthermore, necessary logs could be generated for accountability purposes.

    Research Phase I project will be better preservation of perishable food produce.
    \ The proposed new functionalized packaging film for perishable foods, incorporates
    innovative technologies to eliminate harmful microbes, lock in just-harvested
    aroma and taste, extend shelf-life from field to the kitchen table, and reduce
    food waste. These benefits will accrue to farmers and field workers, to shippers
    and truckers, to retailers who realize less produce waste, and o consumers. The

    microbial protection, slow down the ripening process during shipment and deliver
    just-harvested quality in our fruits and vegetables. MOFs are a novel material
    technology which potentially could transform packaging from ?just plastic bags?
    to true active packaging.\n \nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research
    project are to determine the technical feasibility to extrude a multi-layer film
    with the nano-adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF) material incorporated in
    a layer within linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) film. This functionalized
    film structure will be selectively permeable via the embedded MOF structures to
    allow the exchange of gases, including ethylene, O2, CO2, other biologically active
    gases and certain antimicrobial compounds such as chlorine dioxide. Control of
    fruit and vegetable respiration (O2/CO2 balance), control endogenous and exogenous
    ethylene, and the delivery antimicrobial gases via MOFs could be the single most
    important recent technology breakthrough that allows producers in distant markets
    to delivery fresh produce. This research project will seek to identify MOFs with
    the appropriate gas exchange properties, heat stability in the blown film extrusion
    process and proper orientation within the film structure. Collaborative research
    is needed to select likely MOF candidates, to incorporate these MOFs in films
    extruded on pilot scale equipment, and to characterize effectiveness at a university-based
    postharvest laboratory to enable rapid technology development, impartial assessments,
    and effective reduction to practice."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing and producing a sustainable ink
    for the printing industry. Ink is commonly used in a variety of applications,
    and billions of pounds of ink are produced annually.  The majority of chemicals
    within ink are petroleum based and are mined from the earth.  These chemicals
    also are toxic to humans and the environment. Nature has produced a multitude
    of molecules capable of replacing components currently utilized in ink. While
    many organisms that produce these replacement molecules are slow growing and require
    energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, specifically cyanobacteria,
    are capable of being engineered to generate some of these replacement molecules
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease the overall detrimental impact of traditional
    inks on the environment and human health. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop sustainable ink formulations using engineered cyanobacteria cells capable
    of generating cellular pigments that will make the cultures optically black in
    appearance.  These optically black cells will act as pigments that replace mined
    pigments found in traditional ink formulations. This project uses entire cyanobacteria
    cells in ink formulations so that extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary,
    thus saving energy and reducing cost.  While currently utilized pigments used
    for ink are minerals mined from the ground such as carbon black, which is a finite
    material, cyanobacteria are a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as
    these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise
    unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition
    to the development of renewable cyanobacteria strains considered to be optically
    black, this project will develop optimal growth conditions as well as techno-economic
    models leveraging these strains within several subsets of the ink industry.  Using
    cyanobacteria to produce ink products is a novel application, which will be a
    major breakthrough for the algal bio-products industry."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes: 1) development of novel encryption and authentication technology to improve cybersecurity and 2) the reduction of economic loss due to data breaches.  The larger societal need for new technologies in the cyber arena has been well documented over the past 10 years.  With the growing dependence on computers in practically every aspect of modern life, use of social media, large industries moving towards high performance (faster) computing networks and the coming era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the market for cyber technology is expected to grow at a steady rate of as much as 15% annually.  This project will create a high speed, parallel and Truly-Random Number Generator (TRNG) with signal embedding capabilities.  With an optical core, the device will have advantages over many of the currently available, pseudo-RNG devices based on silicon chip technologies that have been shown vulnerable to hackers.  Additionally, this device will provide a framework for continuous development and possible online authentication features to compliment the hardware.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in development of a prototype device to assess the feasibility of a commercial product.  The basis of the innovation is the use of quantum phenomena in optics to create randomness, also known as noise.  Quantum mechanics has proven to be the underlying mechanism for noise processes used the world over in encryption of data.  In this case, the process of creating noise can be adjusted, oscillated at some frequency, to produce embedded signals overlaid with the random output.  This gives the final design applications well beyond encryption.  With the rise of high performance computing networks in scientific simulations, health care patient tracking, financial institution accessibility, education, etc., the ability to use the embedding feature to track authentication credentials and perform continuous monitoring of equipment accessing a network becomes paramount to securing networks as well as data.  During this project the basic design will be refined with the aim of producing a rescaled, commercial product.

    Reduction of the amount and number of chemicals needed in a detergent formulation
    will enable production of 25% more concentrated detergent products, reducing packaging
    costs and enabling easier formulation of single-dose tablets. The technology offsets
    the carbon footprint of detergent chemical production by using plant-based starting
    materials instead of the current petroleum-based products, which currently dominate
    the industry. Additionally, reduction in the amount of chemicals used in detergents
    reduces environmental impact to waterways. \n\nThe technical objectives in this
    Phase I research project are to develop a bi-functional surfactant chemical for
    laundry detergent applications, benchmark the new surfactants with respect to
    existing molecules, and to optimize the chemical process for effective scale-up.
    The technology will reduce the cost of laundry detergent formulations by eliminating
    the need for chelating agents, which are used to mitigate the negative effects
    of hard water common in cleaning applications. The bi-functional surfactant molecules
    take the role of both a surfactant and a chelating agent, thereby enabling more
    concentrated detergents and improved function for single-dose tablets, especially
    for formulators of plant-based, environmentally-friendly detergents. The technical
    objectives direct development of the new detergent molecules through iterative
    design and testing of detergent structures, resulting in identification of a first
    to market product, as well as reaction engineering and optimization to direct
    efficient design of the process technology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project includes the development of new methods to biodegrade waste plastics. Plastic waste is an significant environmental burden. Over 300 million tons of plastic are used each year, resulting in millions of tons of persistent plastic waste, some of which can take up to 600 years to degrade. Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) can digest polystyrene, also known as Styrofoam, a persistent and widespread source of plastic waste. Beta Hatch Inc. is developing a novel approach to reduce plastic waste. As the mealworms feed, they convert polystyrene into protein and biological waste (frass), both valuable nutrient inputs for animal feed or for fertilizer. This project will screen mealworm strains to identify the best candidates for optimization, develop polystyrene feed mixes to improve the efficiency of digestion, and test the end-products to understand how these might be commercial used. The project will also confirm the safety of polystyrene derived biological products (mealworm protein and frass) for use in the production of non-food animals and fiber crops. This work will support the development of novel and commercially viable approaches for biodegradation of plastics.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop the commercial potential of mealworms for plastic bioremediation. Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic long-chain hydrocarbon polymer. It is a major waste product that takes up 30% of landfill space. The formation of strong molecular bonds between neighboring styrene monomers makes polystyrene extremely stable and therefore extremely difficult to degrade. Mealworms are the only proven organism capable of depolymerizing and mineralizing polystyrene, with the help of beneficial gut microbes. However, for polystyrene biodegradation to be commercially viable, the efficiency of digestion needs to be increased, and the safety of products derived from PS feeding needs to be assessed. Existing work has shown that there is strain-specific variability in PS digestion, and that PS digestion efficiency is only ~50% without additional nutrients. Further, PS feeding may decrease the fertility of mealworms, which would limit the long-term commercial feasibility of mealworm based PS-digestion. This project will identify mealworm strains that show high potential for polystyrene (PS) digestion, test the ability to breed animals with enhanced PS capability, develop feed mixes for optimal efficiency of PS biodigestion, quantify impacts of PS feeding on mealworm life cycles, and collect preliminary data on toxicity of PS-derived biomass and frass products. These experiments support the objectives of 1) identifying pathways for scaling up PS biodigestion by mealworms,  2) integration of PS wastes as a feed for mealworm farming, and 3) collection of key data on the marketability of end-products from polystyrene digestion. This feasibility project&#8232;will also catalyze conversations with customers and regulators on the business challenges and opportunities associated with plastic biodigestion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to make video searchable and discoverable in a cost-effective manner by automating video annotation tasks that are currently done manually. Video is being created at an increasingly high rate, and media companies are becoming overwhelmed by the sheer amount of video in their libraries.  Companies have resorted to paying people to manually watch their videos and "tag" them with relevant descriptions so that the content becomes searchable and therefore useable.  In this project the company will build an inference engine that can leverage the data and structure within video to discover specific multimodal concepts significant to the particular domain and automatically train and refine classifiers to apply unique and meaningful data describing the video.  Leveraging this metadata, companies can index and search their videos more efficiently, enabling them to generate tailored video clips to meet specific goals, and ultimately publish video at a much larger scale.  The company believes the unique domain-specific video metadata generated by its system will have an overwhelming effect on the ability of companies to disseminate informative videos, and improve their use of video online.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project proposes to develop an inference engine that combines the modalities of information in video to automatically discover and train multimodal classifiers for important concepts within specific domains.  Current approaches to video understanding seek to develop general visual classification models; these approaches focus on leveraging labeled data to train supervised learning algorithms in order to describe the video. These approaches fail in specific verticals, because the information output is not granular enough to provide value within the context of the specific domain, and the cost for manual annotation is high. The approach proposed in this project takes into account the multimodal information associated with a group of related videos to automatically learn classifiers for concepts that are important in this video domain, without expensive manual annotation. The approach leverages the correlations between the different modalities in video and existing domain-specific structure to intelligently accomplish this task.  The company expects this research to lead to the discovery of many new domain-specific video concept classifiers that do not exist in current visual ontologies, and a reusable approach for training visual classifiers that can be applied across many domains.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent or reduce the high risk of post-meniscectomy
    osteoarthritis (OA) following partial meniscectomy which is a popular treatment
    for meniscus tears. Meniscus tears represent common lesions injuries prevailing
    in ~36% of people with ages at and greater than 45 years old, but with few effective
    treatments.  Meniscectomy is performed to temporarily relieve the severe pain
    and other symptoms associated with meniscus tears. Over one million patients undergo
    meniscectomy to palliate painful symptoms associating torn meniscus each year
    in the U.S. The drawback of meniscectomy is significant increases of incidence
    of osteoarthritis (OA) later in life (by as high as 7 folds), because loss of
    meniscus causes altered load transmission, decreased shock absorption, and decreased
    joint stability and increased joint cartilage contact stress. Post-meniscectomy
    osteoarthritis (OA) is well documented in literatures. OA is more challenging
    to treat and incur more costly expenditures and causes more severe physical sufferings
    for patients. There is urgent need for effective treatment for meniscus tears

    This SBIR phase I project seeks to address the critical need for lung cancer diagnosis at an early stage. North America has the highest age-standardized incidence of lung cancer in the world. An estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed this year and 158,080 deaths are predicted to occur due to lung cancer in 2016. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is much lower when compared to other common cancers due to late-stage diagnosis of the disease in these patients. The survival rate for lung cancer patients significantly improves when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Early detection of lung cancer by computed tomography scanning is disadvantageous to high false positive rates and the need for invasive and expensive follow-up procedures. The breath analysis technology described in this project can mitigate this health crisis by drastically reducing false positives, lowering the cost of diagnosis and reducing the need for repeated radiographic scans or invasive biopsies. Moreover, the cutting-edge breath analysis technology described in this project can be used for other applications, such as environmental monitoring or detecting other diseases including cancers elsewhere in the body.

    The central innovation proposed in this project is a silicon microreactor consisting of micropillars coated with a carbonyl-selective reagent that covalently captures volatile carbonyls of cancer metabolism exhaled in alveolar breath. The microreactor retains the adducts of these metabolic markers, concentrating them up to 10,000-fold, while allowing all other tidal breath components to pass through unaffected. The biomarker adducts of the chemoselective reagent are eluted from the microreactor using methanol and then quantified via mass spectrometry. Elevated concentrations of certain carbonyl biomarkers are indicative of cancer. The Phase I research objectives are to demonstrate the effectiveness of newly engineered, fast-flow microreactors coated with chemoselective reagents designed for enhanced reactions with unsaturated aldehydes. The microreactor design will be optimized so as to evacuate exhaled breath samples through the microreactors at 10-fold the current rate without compromising VOC capture efficiencies. Also, new hydrazine-based reagents will be synthesized to serve as microreactor coatings in combination with the current carbonyl-selective microreactor coating. These innovations will enable the microreactor approach to overcome the critical challenges faced by current breath analysis technologies for early detection of lung cancer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be a significant improvement in the control of dangerous mosquitoes that transmit serious diseases to humans, including Zika fever, malaria, encephalitis, chikungunya, and dengue fever. This project will generate a novel larvicide directed against the larvae of harmful mosquitoes that live in water. The larvicide is combined with an efficient lure to generate effective bait-and-kill stations that will target only harmful mosquito species. An efficient, inexpensive, safe product to kill mosquito larvae will improve public health since it will greatly reduce the number of adult mosquitoes capable of infecting humans with diseases. The product will protect non-target species and will not contaminate the water with toxins. This project incorporates several new technologies that are also  applicable  to  the  future  control  of  other insect pest species, including a novel design system to produce lures that attract mosquito larvae to bait stations, a new method to kill insect larvae while leaving other species unharmed, and a new method to package the control product. The product and the methods discussed are new, address unmet health and safety needs in several countries, and are expected to have widespread market appeal.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are focused on providing novel attractants for the aquatic larvae of Aedes aegypti and other harmful mosquitos, and combining these lures with a novel larvicide that will eradicate the targeted larvae without contaminating the water column with insecticide or harming non-target species. The mosquito?s range is expanding and traditional control methods are becoming problematic. An effective bait-and-kill device would avoid the wide dispersal of broad-range insecticides and protect the environment, beneficial species, and humans. However, this device requires an efficient attractant to selectively lure mosquito larvae and an effectual, yet selective, larvicide that will not harm non-target species or contaminate  the  water.  These are therefore the foci  of this project.  This project incorporates several novel approaches to develop a microencapsulated nanoparticle that will function as a targeted larvicide. To achieve the stated goals, compounds that strongly attract mosquito larvae will be combined with a nonpoisonous polymer larvicide that is active only uponingestion by the larvae.  The anticipated end product is a bait-and-kill device for A. aegypti larvae that would allow a shift away from broad-spectrum insecticides to a more targeted, responsible control methodology. The platform technologies are applicable to other species in the future.

    Research Phase I project is to improve respiratory protection against ammonia
    by using novel carbide-derived carbons (CDCs). The outcome of this project will
    improve the safety and health for industrial workers, firefighters, and first
    responders that encounter ammonia in industrial settings and emergency situations.
    Current respiratory protection gas masks attempt to prevent users from breathing
    ammonia by trapping the toxic gas on an adsorbent material. Adsorbents on the
    market provide limited protection time against ammonia due to poor attractive
    forces between the adsorbent and ammonia. CDCs overcome these limitations through
    a new synthesis procedure that creates ammonia-specific active sites within its
    structure to bind and trap ammonia. Research on these materials will unlock the
    tools and methods necessary to tailor these adsorbents to other toxic gases. The
    proposed R&D activities address a commercial opportunity within the respiratory
    protection market estimated to be a $6 billion market globally, and $2.4 billion
    market in the U.S. \n\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project
    are to synthesize CDCs that can be easily integrated within a filter cartridge
    and to provide an order of magnitude increase in protection time against ammonia
    compared to current materials. CDCs have promising performance and an enormous
    amount of research activity has been devoted to the synthesis and characterization
    of CDCs for adsorptive applications. However, to date, no commercial adsorptive
    applications of these materials exist. This situation exists in part because insufficient
    attention has been paid to the integration of selective gas adsorption sites,
    control of particle size, and hydrothermal stability, all of which are key technical
    hurdles that will be addressed in this project. This goal will be accomplished
    by synthesizing and testing granular CDCs for selective adsorption of ammonia
    from air, integrating further ammonia-specific active sites via post-synthesis
    modification techniques, and evaluating hydrodynamic and thermal stability of
    CDCs through cyclical stability testing methods. The results from this project
    will significantly further our understanding of CDCs in terms of large particle
    size synthesis, long term stability, and tailored active sites for gas capture.
    The anticipated results would significantly further CDCs for ammonia filtration
    and other commercial separations applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is to addresses challenges in understanding, analyzing, and visualizing data from large sets of unsorted, noisy data associated with massive next generation sequencing (NGS). These projects frequently are focused on pathogen transmission patterns, drug resistance, and general epidemiology and employ a process called "clustering"; however, current clustering tools are rudimentary, not intuitive, poorly documented and provide little help with data management and visualization. The goal is to develop software for Clustering and Associating Sequences in a Personalized Environment (CASPER). This software will bring much needed state-of-the-art software engineering and visualization technology to NGS sequence analysis that results in finding correlations in disparate data-types that are currently overlooked. Further, this software addresses commercial demands for integrated bioinformatics that speed discovery using contemporary and innovative technologies that enhance the end-user experience.  This will increase the ability of researchers to combat major health challenges, perform biological research and develop effective interventions to prevent and treat illness.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a bioinformatics application designed for biological researchers to explore the evolutionary relationships in very large sequence data sets. These data are commonly associated with multiple annotations and there are time-consuming hurdles in acquiring a meaningful visual representation of their relationships, especially in combination with geospatial, demographic and/or temporal data. Further, while many bioinformatics applications/approaches focus on achieving a single analytical task, the proposed software focuses extensively on the end-user, so that efficient and accurate data processing are combined with rich and meaningful graphical outputs. In addition, it will provide a graphical database management system (GDBS) built around the researcher's data as it is imported, resulting in fewer errors. A database linked to analytical results allows for rapid result filtering as well as instantaneous updates as data sets expand over time. Integrated visualization tools allow researchers to produce varied network graphics that can show how results change over time. In Phase I, the goal is to focus on developing a framework to optimize the end-user experience (e.g., speed, intuitive design, useful formatting of results). The project brings together a powerful and unique group of scientists in the fields of software design, computer modeling, data visualization, bioinformatics, genetic analysis and epidemiology.

    Transfer (STTR) project is the development of technology for use of sulfide mining
    waste streams as a novel energy source for the production of chemicals from CO2.
    Sulfide mining wastes pose a serious, perpetual environmental risk, and are continuously
    generated as by-products of mining operations. The sulfide minerals in mining
    waste also are viable energy source for a diverse community of microbes that derive
    their energy from the oxidation of these minerals. This biological oxidation releases
    significant amounts of energy from the rock. The energy released from one ton
    of sulfide mining waste is approximately equivalent to one barrel of oil. Approximately
    95% of copper ores are found in sulfide-rich ore deposits and at about 20 million
    metric tons annually, constitute ~15% of mining waste (representing millions of
    barrels of oil).  From genetically engineered microbes, it is proposed to use
    this energy to generate chemicals from CO2. As such, sulfide waste streams represent
    a new high energy feedstock for the sustainable production of chemicals from CO2.
    This technology will improve the sustainability of mining and provide a non-agricultural,
    non-photosynthetic and economically attractive route to carbon-neutral chemicals.\n
    \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the development of genetically
    modified A. ferrooxidans for the utilization of mining process waste streams as
    a feedstock for biotechnology applications. Readily available sulfur-rich waste
    streams produced during the traditional smelting processing of copper contain
    about 40% per metric ton of the energy of glucose, and about 20 million metric
    tons are produced annually in the U.S. These energy intensive waste streams are
    currently landfilled, and their environmental oxidation can lead to acid mine
    drainage. To leverage this opportunity, the ability to rationally engineer this
    species to produce isobutyric acid from atmospheric CO2 has been developed. The
    specific aims of this proposal are: 1) develop model reactor systems to characterize
    performance and operations using actual mine tailing feedstocks; 2) improve biological
    productivity through further metabolic engineering of A. ferrooxidans; and 3)
    develop a sophisticated techno-economic analysis of the novel bioprocess. In addition,
    a commitment from a mining company for access to a tailing feedstock supply and
    a site to construct and operate a pilot-scale plant will be secured. Accomplishing
    these goals will prepare for a future follow-on Phase II proposal to scale-up
    our technology, further characterize performance on actual process streams, and
    demonstrate large-scale process feasibility."

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this project will be to create a depth vision system that accelerates
    the transition to intelligent automation. The intelligent automation movement is driven by the opportunity
    to increase human productivity, and it can be seen in all domains: from Siemen?s self-organizing
    manufacturing plants to Amazon?s proposed delivery drones. This project aims to improve robotic vision,
    which is currently a limitation to greater autonomy. The research uses innovations in semiconductor
    physics to create time-of-flight depth cameras that reach new levels of spatial resolution and fidelity. These
    cameras, in conjunction with rapidly evolving software that uses depth data to model the physical world,
    give robotic systems the human-like abilities they need to perform more complicated tasks in dynamic
    environments. Robotics will become increasingly effective at the navigation, material handling, and object
    manipulation tasks that are the basis of so many manufacturing and logistics processes. The project
    outcomes will advance the state-of-the-art in depth vision technology, and provide a prototype camera that
    can be used to test a variety of challenging object recognition tasks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an important limitation in depth
    cameras that use the phase delay time-of-flight (TOF) method. Existing TOF cameras use ?pixel-level
    demodulation?: specially designed photodetector arrays where each pixel performs both light detection and
    demodulation. This design limits the modulation frequency, and thus depth accuracy, because the high
    frequency signals create excessive noise and parasitic capacitances. The authors propose an alternative
    ?optical demodulation? design wherein light is demodulated by a single fast optical shutter, and then
    collected by a separate conventional image sensor. By separating light modulation from light detection,
    parasitic capacitances are eliminated and it is possible to reach high frequencies with acceptable power
    consumption and noise. The research program will develop new optical shutters that demonstrate these
    characteristics, and integrate the shutters into a functioning prototype depth camera. Success will show that
    TOF cameras can be produced with substantially higher spatial resolution and design flexibility.

    This project will develop an immersive and dynamic multi-player game that addresses a pressing need to provide engaging technologies that prepare students to apply collaborative, cross-disciplinary scientific practices to global societal challenges. In an augmented classroom with their real life peers, students must establish a colony on Mars that is capable of sustaining thousands of refugees from Earth. To successfully achieve their goal, students must use raw materials found on Mars to produce components necessary for life support and building, such as food, water, oxygen, and fuel. In the weeks that this simulation runs alongside their real classroom, students will apply cross-disciplinary STEM knowledge and practices to experience how both individual and collective actions have short- and long-term effects. The game and supporting curriculum will address content from the Next Generation Science Standards and ultimately help adolescent youth understand the need for the integration of science and engineering to tackle critical issues such as the production of clean energy, identification and treatment of disease, the allocation of adequate food and water, and global environmental change (NRC, 2011). Creating educational games that more closely mirror their AAA counterparts provides an opportunity to draw diverse genders and underrepresented youth into STEM-related fields.


    This project?' goal is to create "virtual field trips" that augment a classroom and run simultaneous to it, providing applications and experiential learning in a highly engaging social environment. It will build upon previous proprietary technology that enables simultaneous online interactions, complex distributed simulations, and data gathering in shared virtual worlds. This allows the project in its initial phase to focus not only on developing a quality game for students but also on designing and testing high-risk approaches to classroom integration. This game includes the teacher and suggests actions that alter narrative arcs, provide students with key knowledge, or increase or constrain other material resources students have available. Teachers will be able to leverage data collected on student game play to pair small, dynamic groupings of students with high impact mini-lessons to allow the project to actively support teachers as they implement personalized, data-driven instruction. By including a teacher-friendly assessment toolkit, the project can operate within districts' current requirements while experimenting with the future of educational gaming in the classroom. Phase I research will focus on usability and impact on student learning, as well as attempt to understand how willing teachers are to accept and use the teacher support features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring to market a novel power chip architecture for battery-operated electronics, such as smartphones, wearable electronics, electric vehicles, blade servers, cloud-infrastructure hardware, telecom devices, tablets, routers, LED lightning, etc. There are four critical requirements of the power management integrated circuits (PMIC) when used in mobile devices: (1) high energy efficiency for a longer battery run-time between charges; (2) small solution size by freeing up extremely limited space for new functionalities; (3) fast response speed for wide variety of uses; and (4) simplified circuit design for shortening new products' time-to-market. Currently, no solutions are capable of simultaneously meeting the above four requirements. It has become necessary to consider a new topology that could help enabling more efficient Internet of Things designs. It is therefore an object of this proposal to develop novel power chips where the above four requirements can be easily met. Consequently, for any direct current powered mobile devices, as long as they are consuming large power, struggling with limited spaces, and requiring efficient cooling effects, the proposed solution aims to achieve the optimal performance.

    Unlike the present power management integrated chip (PMIC) solutions that have to lose one or more features for a certain improvement, the proposed intellectual merits achieve all of the important features in one single architecture without losing anything. The new PMIC architecture has been preliminarily verified using computer modeling simulation based on ideal circuit models. The objective of this project is to develop new power management chips for use in smartphones and to achieve optimal testing results when verified with 180 nanometer CMOS processes. The R&D scope includes intellectual property core block circuits design, reusable sub-module testing, and mixed signal top-level simulations where the combination of all blocks and modules will be thoroughly represented, within which a circuit that will be etched onto the wafer in Phase II must function correctly. This work?s goal is to demonstrate that the proposed PMIC architecture is a valid solution to fundamentally address the major pain points in the mobile device market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a large-scale process for production of vault-stabilized enzymes. This project will develop a new nanoparticle-based technology for stabilizing enzymes so that they can be used for industrial applications and environmental cleanup such as water treatment. By employing a scalable, high yield, low cost manufacturing system for vault-enzymes, the company would be able to deploy a variety of new products into the field for treating certain environmental pollutants in drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, and reclaimed water. This would give environmental engineers and regulatory agencies new tools to clean and protect national natural resources and public health.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a yeast-based production system for nano-scale vault particles. Vault nanoparticles are promising candidates to stabilize and enhance the performance of enzymes for catalytic industrial applications and biotransformation. The packaging of enzymes into vault particles combines enzyme purification and immobilization into a single manufacturing step, and is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly approach for immobilizing and protecting enzymes. Demonstrating feasibility of this system will allow simple integration of vault-enzymes into industrial manufacturing systems and would allow vault enzyme prototypes to be rapidly scaled up and deployed for specific environmental remediation targets.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop novel software technologies to assess
    cellular metabolism, which is critical for optimizing cell-based manufacturing
    of biochemicals, drugs, and foods. The same technology also may be used for drug
    discovery and therapeutic applications to treat metabolic diseases such as cancer

    the proposed technology will enable commercial investigators to identify slow

    to improve cells for biomanufacturing. It is anticipated that the expanded use
    of these metabolic analysis tools will have a widespread impact on the US economy
    through enabling faster product and process development in the biotechnology and
    pharmaceuticals industries. It also will enable the establishment of a more scalable

    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop software tools and modular assays that
    will enable commercial investigators to fully integrate 13C flux analysis into
    their metabolic engineering toolbox. This technology provides direct readouts
    of metabolic pathway activities inside of living cells, which are otherwise impossible
    to directly measure. However, the majority of 13C flux studies to date have been
    performed in academic labs and have received limited attention in industrial settings.
    This is largely due to the lack of combined experimental and computational expertise
    to effectively perform 13C flux studies in industry. This research is innovative
    because it marks an important step in moving 13C flux analysis outside of the
    academic lab space and into the commercial space. The overall objective of this

    flux analysis software consistent with current standards of commercial research
    software, and 2) develop standardized, high-throughput, modular flux assays for
    quantifying the metabolism of industrial cell factories. The key outcomes of this

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to significantly reduce the electricity consumed by cooling and refrigeration systems. Cooling systems consume nearly 10% of the electricity generated in the United States. During summer months, cooling and refrigeration systems are needed the most, but are also when they are the least efficient. This results in a significant strain on our nation's electricity grid. By improving the efficiency of cooling systems, less electricity will be needed at the utility scale, particularly during peak hours and in the summer. Furthermore, operators of commercial cooling systems could reduce their overall electricity expenses and increase their revenues and profits. The project?s outcomes will also create a pathway to improve the efficiency of cooling systems that does not involve the use of increasingly scarce freshwater resources, and could eventually lead to more water-efficient cooling systems at the largest scales. Finally, this project's approach harnesses renewable resource, the sky, which is source of cooling that is currently untapped.


    The technical innovation being proposed harnesses a renewable resource, the sky, through a mechanism known as radiative sky cooling, to dramatically improve the efficiency of cooling systems. By using specialized optical surfaces that reject heat as thermal radiation to the sky, while simultaneously reflecting nearly all incident sunlight, it is possible to passively cool below the air temperature 24 hours a day. In this project, a refrigeration system incorporating such surfaces will be developed with the aim of demonstrating improved efficiency over conventional systems. In this process no water is evaporated and the only electricity needed is for pumping. Furthermore, modeling will be performed to understand how such a system could be scaled up for use in larger deployments. At the end of the&#8232;Phase I project, a pathway towards large-scale deployment of a transformative clean energy technology, used to improve the efficiency of cooling systems, will be demonstrated.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a point-of-care (POC) blood chemistry test that can measure multiple analytes simultaneously with a single drop of blood. Blood chemistry tests are the most frequently ordered tests by physicians. This proposed lab-on-a-chip and associated analyzer for blood chemistry tests will benefit society by improving the quality of health care delivery and reducing costs. This device?s minimally invasive procedure reduces: fear and discomfort caused by needles, level of skill needed for sample collection, and errors associated with pre-analytical testing steps. The device?s patent-protected optode technology, which utilizes the color spectrum to measure concentrations, differentiates it from electrochemical technology, which is used by competing POC devices. Briefly, optode technology has lower manufacturing complexity, requires much less blood, has a more robust output, and can test more analytes simultaneously. The initial target application will be neonatal blood chemistry testing because of a strong need to minimize blood draw volumes. Upon clinical acceptance of the technology in the neonatal market, the simple-to-use platform will be expanded to other applications, including acute care centers, first responders, primary care, military care, and disaster relief organizations. This platform will also be expanded to test many other analytes, and should help create many new U.S. jobs in the process.

    The proposed optode-based lab-on-a-chip device will be capable of testing various analytes simultaneously with a single drop of blood, which has not been achieved by commercial POC devices. This innovative optode technology has several advantages over electrochemical technology. First, the optode technology enables extremely small sample volume requirements compared to electrochemical sensors (6-10 ìL vs. 65-100 ìL) and eliminates the need for mixing of reagents. Second, fabrication complexity is greatly simplified using optodes because it requires less layers, less raw materials, and simpler manufacturing steps. Third, optode technology provides a more robust output by using a combination of multiple wavelengths on the visual light spectrum and not a single current output as used in electrochemical technology. Finally, this platform technology will result in unique multiplex analyte combinations, including the first ever handheld basic metabolic panel (BMP) test that requires just a single drop of blood. The primary goal of this
    Phase I SBIR is to demonstrate feasibility of this micro-dispensed, lab-on-a-chip system to evaluate clinical samples. In this one-year project, Objective 1 will develop automated sensor manufacturing methods. Objective 2 will confirm the performance of the developed lab-on-a-chip to quantify analytes in sera samples in FDA-required non-clinical tests and when compared to an FDA-approved, POC analyzer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at development of a novel, low-cost process for manufacturing environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) for ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) in aviation gas turbines. A key limitation for CMC adoption is the unavailability of inexpensive, truly gas impervious EBCs to provide required CMC engine service life. While novel EBC compositions have been identified, methods of depositing thin, dense gas impervious coatings with these compositions have largely been vapor-based processes that are expensive, inefficient (non-line-of-sight) and slow (low deposition rates). Efforts to utilize low-cost, and fast plasma spray processes, familiar to the turbine industry, have had some success, but still need major improvements. As an enabling technology for CMC adoption into aircraft gas turbines, the proposed EBC processing technology, solution precursor plasma spray, has the potential to fuel wider adoption of CMCs into aviation gas turbines. The EBC market itself, driven by such a wider adoption of CMCs, can grow to over $300 Million by 2025. The efficiency gains due to such wider adoption of CMCs can substantially lower fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 15% in new aircraft.

    The intellectual merit of this project is illustrated by the fact that it is the first demonstration of solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) for EBC processing. The unique ability of the SPPS process to achieve very thin, high-density coatings is driven by the very small splat sizes of the solution-derived particles relative to powder-based processes. The SPPS process offers a route to get coatings similar to what is feasible with vapor based processes, but at much faster coating rates and lower cost. In the SPPS approach, a liquid chemical precursor, containing the desired cations, is atomized into the plasma jet. The injected solution evaporates and the resulting chemicals are pyrolyzed, followed by melting and deposition of targeted oxides as splat of sizes less than 5 microns compared to 30-125 microns with the conventional air plasma spray process. This makes the deposition of thin, dense coatings possible. In Phase I, the feasibility of depositing thin, dense state-of-the art EBC compositions on silicon carbide substrates will be demonstrated, and preliminary durability of the coatings will be demonstrated. The deposition of EBCs with thickness less than 50 micron and with density greater than 95% will be demonstrated.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the use of a new carbon-based water treatment process to condition and soften hard water sources. Specifically, this treatment process uses functionalized porous carbon sheets and small applied electrical voltages (<1.2 V) to target (adsorb and desorb) salt molecules from hard water streams. In addition, this process is reversible, resulting in a carbon-based filter that can soften water streams without significant maintenance or upkeep and providing a water softening solution that does not add to the "throw-away" culture that is common to many water treatment devices. Importantly, no salt or chemical additives are needed for this softening technique, further limiting its environmental impact in comparison to conventional salt-based softeners, and the energy required for this separation may best the most efficient techniques in use today.

    The proposed process is called inverted capacitive deionization (i-CDI). In i-CDI, salt molecules are naturally attracted to the carbon electrode surfaces due to the creation of electrodes possessing significant surface charge in aqueous environments. Electrodes are then regenerated using a small voltage, matched to the surface chemistry of the functionalized carbon electrodes, and salt is concentrated into a discharge stream. Through this Phase II project, the i-CDI process will be demonstrated for water softening applications in both food & beverage and industrial environments. Currently, water softening in these industries is carried out through chemical treatments, ion exchange, or selective membranes. In this project, surface charged carbon electrodes will be used in "flow-through" cell modules to demonstrate preferential removal of calcium, magnesium, carbonate, and other hardness-causing ions to soften multiple hard water sources. Comparisons will be drawn between this new i-CDI technology and incumbent water treatment techniques to outline benefits towards equipment downtime, energy costs, and effectiveness of the separation. Liquid sampling and lifetime studies will be conducted to further prove the benefits of this membrane-free, salt-free system.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    bond. If successful, this effort will lead to a new class of high-performance
    composite resins which can be recycled. Increased emphasis on energy efficiency
    is driving the adoption of lightweight, thermoset composites in the transportation
    sector. But the intractability of traditional thermosets limits the value and
    therefore adoption of recycled composites. Industry composites recycling experts
    estimate the overall scrap cost for the composites industry is between $500 and
    $750 million a year. Post-manufacturing scrap can account for up to 50 percent
    of the input materials. Carbon fiber composites for automotive applications represent
    an emerging and high-growth potential area for epoxy thermosets. A small volume,
    composite car line represents roughly 400 metric tons of polyamine curing agent.
    In the Phase II effort, novel, recyclable polyamine structures will be designed
    and synthesized, and further formulated with various epoxy resins to meet the
    glass transition temperature (Tg) requirements for transportation composites manufacturing.
    Doing so will help composite manufacturers lower costs and meet regulatory compliance
    for recyclability and manufacturing waste disposal. \n\nThe intellectual merit
    of this project will be an expanded knowledge base and chemistry platform for
    synthesizing and formulating recyclable thermoset resins. Multivalent amines,
    by nature, provide higher structural rigidity of a matrix. Multivalency, by nature,
    translates to an overall higher cross-link density of a thermoset epoxy material.
    For example, composites of higher glass transition temperature, and faster cure
    speed can be achieved. New multivalent structures will complement the initial
    generation of recyclable aliphatic diamines, and enable applications previously
    unattainable by recyclable aliphatic structures alone, such as transportation
    composites. Pre-screened target cyclic scaffolds have been identified and targeted
    for synthesis. Successfully synthesized molecules will be further screened for
    physical properties and recyclability. Candidate molecules will then be formulated
    into full resin systems and optimized for a high-pressure resin transfer molding
    (HP-RTM) process, to meet the processing and cost needs of automotive manufacturers.
    Partners in the automotive industries will aid in testing and evaluating the performance
    of the formulated material. By creating new recyclable molecules that \"mimic\"
    other major industrial classes beyond aliphatic amines, the addressable market
    for these materials will be expanded and the adoption of recyclable thermoset
    composites will be accelerated."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution,
    protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients
    blinded by retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and
    age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases
    affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence
    for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. While
    improved quality of life is the most vital outcome of this technology, reduction
    of medical costs of treating chronic retinal degeneration and limiting time with
    doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field.  The work outlined
    in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding
    of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more
    effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant
    under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution
    retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration,
    and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality
    of life. \n\nThe proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in
    vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase
    I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate
    the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical
    procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal
    implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate
    a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the
    retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical
    device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional
    integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy
    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of
    biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results
    from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology
    under development."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system.  Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand.  The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale.  In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of new tools to understand the dynamic behavior of cellular machinery that is disrupted in disease. Unraveling the dynamic aspects of cellular physiology that may be targeted therapeutically requires new technologies capable of profiling the response of entire signaling pathways to pharmacological intervention targeted at single pathway nodes. The availability of physiologically relevant live-cell models that are compatible with visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal regulation of disease-relevant signal transduction pathways and cellular machinery will be key to enabling this approach.  The ability to monitor multiple facets of key cancer signaling pathways in this way represents a valuable opportunity to identify potent and selective therapeutic inhibitors of "undruggable" targets, such as the Ras protein, which is a crucial driver of more than 30% of cancers. By enabling development of a robust and scalable high-throughput live-cell assay platform, this technology may reduce the time and cost to pinpoint the mechanism of action and off-target effects of pharmaceutical chemicals, thus delivering new capabilities to rapidly and cost-effectively identify safe and effective therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a robust and flexible platform for rapid generation of precision-engineered, multicolor fluorescent cell lines and associated high-throughput microscopy-based assays. This platform contrasts with industry standard methods for developing such cell lines and assays, which are lengthy and inflexible.  The project comprises optimization and execution of four components:  1) Generation of a panel of cell lines compatible with rapid, reliable stable reporter integration; 2) Delivery of a library of approximately 25 multicolor reporters of the Ras/MAPK pathway; 3) Rapid generation and validation of a library of  approximately 100 validated stable reporter cell lines expressing all therapeutically relevant mutations and isoforms of the Ras/MAPK pathway;  and 4) 384-well plate assay development and screening of these Ras/MAPK reporter cells using tool compounds. The project aims to demonstrate the capability of the platform to rapidly pinpoint compound mechanism of action and potential off-target effects by monitoring multiple facets of previously inaccessible biology associated with a critical, high-value oncology target in live cells. The standardized platform established in the course of this project will allow rapid expansion to additional clinically relevant signaling pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a new low cost decision support tool to help growers optimize resources and grow more crop per drop. The company is developing extremely low cost environmental sensors that will enable growers to capture highly granular environmental data in the field and derive optimal irrigation strategies through the application of data science. Water is a major contributor to crop yields and growers struggle to deal will water scarcity and quality, coupled with variability in the soils and irrigation systems. Through the use of a data driven, closed loop decision support tool, growers will be better equipped to deal with variability, make better resource use decisions and improve crop yields. This new approach has the potential to enable growers to increase yields by as much as 15% while maintaining or reducing water use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the detection of moisture and soil texture in soils using a low cost soil moisture sensor based on magnetics. Growers rely on field data, including soil moisture, to make daily decisions that impact plant health. The most significant decision is when to apply water and in what quantity. Current approaches to detecting soil moisture (and other soil characteristics) in an automated fashion are expensive and unreliable leaving growers searching for alternatives. The objective of this project is to develop a sensitive, accurate, and reliable sensor that measures soil moisture using a novel, magnetics based approach. During the project the team will build prototype sensors, test them in lab and field environments, develop algorithms for calibrating the sensor, and explore new approaches to presenting multidimensional field data to growers in a manner that facilitates understanding and decision making.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform how substance use disorders (SUDs) are diagnosed, monitored and treated by creating an integrated technology platform for health care providers. One important application is the early detection of risky substance use behavior that, if treated in the beginning stages, will reduce the rate of fully developed SUDs. The research and development performed on this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be key to creating a novel bio-sensor based approach to diagnosing, monitoring and treating substance abuse patients.  The collected bio-sensor data can also inform treatment solutions to help address this tremendous problem, which affects millions of people, costs the US economy billions of dollars annually, and incurs a significant human cost in terms of lost lives, broken families, and unfulfilled potential.  There is also strong demand for a robust solution in places where substance use detection and monitoring is mandated for safety reasons, including the court system and the military services, as well as occupations like air traffic controllers, pilots, train operators, truck drivers, bus drivers, and operators of heavy machinery.

    The proposed project will focus on integrating biosensors with smartphone technology to detect, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata and to push resulting behavior change instructions to the user. By establishing a connection between the sensors and a smartphone application we will report substance abuse treatment outcome data much more accurately than is currently possible via self-reporting.  This system will address engineering, manufacturing, and calibration challenges of a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This technology bypasses the limitations of existing methods with a dramatically different approach. The technology aims to greatly simplify the process of SUD diagnosis and treatment by empowering health care providers to implement accurate data collection, early detection, and custom-tailored intervention within the context of any routine office visit.  The proposed project will address the development of a substance use measuring biosensor and assess the sensor lifetime, stability, reproducibility, and sensitivity.  It is intended to develop a biosensor that patients can wear for a period of time, that we can establish a meaningful connection between the sensor and the mobile application to replace self-reporting, and that concept support can be gained from broader representation of primary care physicians and major insurance companies

    Transfer Phase I project is the accelerated utilization of crop materials for
    the manufacture of biobased aromatic chemicals such as terephthalic acid and benzoic
    acid, which currently have global market value of $60 billion and $200 million,
    respectfully. This project focusses on benzoic acid (applications ranging from
    food additives to plasticizers) as the first commercial target to gain a market
    foothold and develop this technology. This technology will provide a biobased
    source for benzoic acid, which is currently produced almost exclusively from the
    oxidation of petrochemical toluene. Situated in Iowa, the epicenter of biomass
    production in the United States, SusTerea Biorenewables LLC can impact the rural
    economy, expand the utilization of crop materials beyond ethanol into the production
    of biobased chemicals. \n\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project
    is development of the biobased coumalic acid platform, for producing an array
    of industrially important aromatic molecules. The technological basis for the
    project began with the identification by researcehers at the NSF Engineering Research
    Center, Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) of a chemical catalysis pathway
    to transform an industrially optimized fermentation product (malic acid) into
    coumalic acid and the discovery that coumalic acid could be used to produce an
    array of aromatics such as benzoic acid, terephthalic acid, and dimethyl terephthalate.
    Thus, coumalic acid has the potential to become a platform chemical opportunity
    in the burgeoning biorenewable chemical industry. First, the reaction conditions
    including temperature, pressure and solvent using an industrially relevant bench
    scale continuous flow reactor will be optimized. Second, new catalysts to substitute
    noble metals will be explored for the key aromatization step. Third, this experimental
    data will be used to construct a preliminary process design and a techno- economic
    model towards developing a scalable production technology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to address the grand challenge of human-induced nitrogen loading to the environment. An easy-to-use and affordable system will target a major source of nitrogen releases to watersheds: the on-site systems that treat wastewater from millions of households and commercial facilities across the U.S.  The need to mitigate harmful algal blooms and prevent other damaging cumulative effects to aquatic ecosystems have created an urgent demand for onsite technologies that remove nitrogen at its source. The proposed nitrogen removal technology is modular and adaptable for use in small-scale systems that treat wastewater from individual homes, community systems and commercial establishments. The project employs an innovative biological nitrogen removal process that that will be verified and optimized for high priority applications in rural, peri-urban, and urban settings. The system is mechanically simple, generates no waste products, and operates passively with minimal maintenance, energy or consumables.  The results from this project will help to solve the critical challenge of nitrogen control by providing a highly efficient, low-cost, commercializable system that is practicable for on-site wastewater treatment in new and retrofit systems.

    The technical objectives of this Phase I research project are to design, construct, field-test, and critically evaluate variant prototypes of an innovative bioreactor system to remove nitrogen from onsite wastewater.  Prototype bioreactors will be operated and monitored over multiple months to investigate their salient operational characteristics and define effective design and treatment regimes.  The bioreactors will be installed to treat real household wastewater under field conditions.  Nitrogen analytes will be monitored across the bioreactor systems to delineate the effects of biotreatment on four nitrogen species: organic nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite.  The effects of the biotreatment system on chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, inorganic chemical parameters, and other wastewater constituents of interest will also be elucidated.  The project will critically evaluate the effectiveness of total nitrogen removal and the stability and resiliency of individual nitrogen removal transformations.  The work will confirm the longevity and robustness of the nitrogen removal process and identify design and operating parameters that optimize an innovative approach to remove total nitrogen from on-site wastewater while mitigating nitrogen releases to the environment.  Prototype design and monitoring will facilitate scale-up of results to full-scale biotreatment systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is cost-effective, eco-friendly membranes that significantly benefit fossil-fuel power plants and gas separation technologies by reducing energy consumption and membrane cost. The proposed disruptive technology has a direct impact on one of our key centennial societal challenges, i.e. reducing greenhouse gas emissions by separating and capturing carbon dioxide. This project will help enable new approaches for manufacturing new cost-effective, high performance, and durable membranes with wide applicability due to the abundance of the raw materials and ease of manufacturing processes. Broadly, the project can impact various separation technologies such as separation and storage of hydrogen for fuel cells, water desalination and filtration, and separation of biomolecules and radioactive waste.

    The technical objective in this Phase I research project is developing a facile but disruptive technology to synthesize novel nanoporous membrane products capable of efficient separation of CO2 gas molecules from fossil-fuel power plants. The core technology relies on coupling size-exclusion separation mechanisms and affinity-based adsorption to provide superior performance. The proposed novel technology will mitigate the existing challenges in current membrane technologies such as high-temperature instability, low-flux, high-cost, and manufacturing difficulties. The final membrane product can be employed by various energy sectors and industrial gases and will provide a low-cost solution that is more energy-efficient, durable, and demonstrates exceptional CO2 selectivity, as compared to existing technologies.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the clinical success of spinal and
    orthopedic implants to keep more Americans healthy and active.  Our focus is to
    enhance properties of a widely used implant material made of a polymer. As a hard
    plastic, it is beneficial for strength but unfavorable for integrating with surrounding
    tissue. As a result, a high percentage of polymer implants loosen because they
    do not integrate well with bone.  Our innovation expands scientific and technical
    understanding by investigating a novel nano-engineered surface coating for polymer
    implants.  The outcome of this proposal could be a revolutionary implant surface
    with rapid healing, sound integration, and lowered risk of implant failures. Surgeons
    could have higher success rates and save on operating time. Patients could have
    fewer complications.  Insurers could pay less for procedures.  Manufacturers could
    offer a superior technology. This novel surface technology will be applied to
    spinal implants first and then expanded into craniofacial, trauma, sports medicine,
    hip, knee, and extremities applications. Our goal is to bring this technology
    to market to provide the tens of thousands of Americans undergoing orthopedic
    procedures each year a pain-free, mobile lifestyle.  \n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop a nano-engineered surface coating on polymer implants for treating
    spinal fusions. The goal is to reduce back problem unions due to inhibited osseointegration
    by presenting an implant surface that intimately interacts with host bone down
    to the cellular level. We plan to do this by using advanced materials processing
    techniques for creating nano-engineered surfaces on polymer substrates (Objective
    1). Next, we will validate with advanced imaging techniques the presence of the
    nano-engineered structures on the implant surface (Objective 2). The anticipated
    outcome will be a novel surface coating with a nanostructure that has superior
    material attributes on the macro, micro and nano levels. Extensive material characterization
    will validate the procedure. Successful development of fabrication methods will
    lead to mechanical testing (Objective 3). The novelty of this nano-engineered
    surface coating is that it relies on the characteristics of the surface itself
    to create a rapid and powerful bond with host bone enhancing the bone union process
    using biomaterial science."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes a significant impact on the electric power contingency analysis conducted by industries around the globe. The proposed algorithm can be used by power system planning units, operators, utility companies, universities, and research centers and provides designers, engineers, and scientists with the opportunity of a considerable reduction in computation efforts in performing power grid dynamic simulations, especially in the grids with high penetration of renewable and small-scale generators. It allows conducting more studies in shorter time and leads to significant personnel and equipment cost reduction. In addition, the proposed algorithm is a significant step forward towards realizing a real-time power system analyzer, which can be used to alleviate the adverse effects of faults and disturbances in small and large electric power systems.  Thus, the proposed algorithm potentially helps enhance modern power system reliability and resiliency by providing a fast and accurate analysis of the system under various possible contingencies. As the power grid is one of the most important and fundamental infrastructures in each society, the proposed project will directly enhance social welfare.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a software program for dynamic analysis of power grids. In electric power industries, grid simulators are vital tools to evaluate and analyze dynamic behavior of the grid. Power grids are large-scale networks that are mathematically modeled by thousands of variables and equations. Analysis of such a large number of variables and equations is very time-consuming. Integration of intermittent renewable energy resources as well as small-scale low-inertia generators to modern power grids make the network analysis even more challenging. In the proposed algorithm (to become a software program) a novel mathematical solver is proposed that significantly reduces the computations required to solve the well-known differential-algebraic equations describing power systems. The proposed algorithm contributes to the reduction of the size of the Jacobian matrix and removal of the error loop in the power grid dynamic simulations. These improvements significantly increase the speed of the proposed software program in analyzing dynamic behavior of power grids when compared to the available methods. Preliminary studies show that the proposed power grid simulator can perform at least 30 times faster than the standard Newton-Raphson algorithm when simulating large grids with significant number of generators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is through the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for concentrated solar power plants that would make solar power an economical and viable source of renewable energy for mass consumption. With the worldwide growing need for energy, alternative sources of energy have been the primary focus of research over the past few decades. Molten salt heat transfer fluid used in concentrated solar power plants are one sub-area of such research. Molten salts have excellent stability at high temperature (>650C) and can be mined and easily manufactured into solar heat transfer fluids at a reasonable cost.  Additionally, the developed molten salt heat transfer fluid would increase the efficiency of energy generation in solar power plants and provide potential cost savings  by utilizing ubiquitous economical metals such as stainless steel. The heat transfer fluid could potentially  bring the subsidy-free installed system price at the utility scale to a competitive price of 5-6 cents per kilowatt-hour.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to (i) develop a fundamental understanding of interfacial corrosion of 316L stainless steel in molten chloride salt compositions and (ii) inhibit this corrosion by utilizing suitable additives. It is known that chloride salts could potentially increase the operating temperatures (to 900 Celcius) and hence enhance the energy efficiency of solar power plants. However, the extreme corrosive behavior of molten chlorides towards the stainless steel pipes utilized in solar plants has prevented their usage for practical applications. With the fundamental corrosion insight gained through this research project, Dynalene intends to develop proprietary inhibitor compositions that can be added to the chloride salt in-situ during the operation of a solar power plant. These additives would minimize corrosion by forming a continuous  and inert ceramic layer at the operating temperature on the stainless steel surface, and simultaneo usly strengthen the grain boundaries. Dynalene had some initial success in growing a few micron-thick inert, continuous  ceramic layer on a stainless  steel surface. In this project, Dynalene  will  develop a corrosion package that would reduce dechromatization in steel and restrict the corrosion rate of 316L stainless  steel to 10 micro-meters/year

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to greatly improve mobile app user experience, boost developer productivity, and speed up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app performance debugging and optimization.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-performance apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers optimize Android app performance. The product continuously tests app performance across code changes to detect performance issues as soon as slow code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project extends to academics and industry stakeholders holding intellectual or financial interests that are impacted by climate change. Given growing evidence for climate change-driven increases in extreme weather events over recent years, it has become increasingly important for stakeholders to factor climate change into their resilience plans. Engineering firms must embed changes in risks into engineering design processes due to increased urbanization, coastal inhabitancy, and climate change impacts. Insurance companies need to base risk assessments, underwriting strategies, and reinsurance purchasing decisions on quantitative methods that appropriately consider credible, probabilistic projections of changes in extremes with appropriate uncertainty bounds. Public agencies, municipalities, and private organizations must implement resilience strategies for critical infrastructure that will withstand climate extremes at decadal to multidecadal scales. This project focuses on developing and translating patent-protected research to analytics and products that address the emerging needs of these industry stakeholders. The publications and software developed via this proposal will significantly advance best practices in hazard risk assessment and climate change adaptation, and a sample of the New England design storm curves will be made freely available to support educational and outreach efforts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the deep uncertainties in climate projections rooting from intrinsic variability and longstanding gaps in physics understanding. The project will consist of developing a Physics-Guided Statistical Modeling (PGSM) framework for probabilistically quantifying projected changes in regional precipitation extremes, and translating those projections to actionable, climate change-informed local design storm curves. The initial focus is on precipitation extremes given that theory and evidence suggest climate change-driven increases in storm severity in many regions, that these projections are needed to enhance design curves, and given they are crucial inputs to flood models that will be pursued aggressively in subsequent efforts. The project will culminate in multiple deliverables, including (1) peer reviewed scientific publications, (2) a proprietary spatio-temporal precipitation extremes database, and (3) design storm curves for a New England testbed, the last of which will be disseminated via a software prototype.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an infrastructure for exposing and interpreting a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are continuously building and shaping the world but there exists little data to examine these effects. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society specifically by improving the economic efficiency of retailers and broadly by increasing scientific understanding of how humans interact with their physical environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses a neural network and generic 3D scene reconstruction in combination with low-cost, wireless cameras to model an environment with accurate object classification and spatial relationships. Recently, neural networks have proven adept at a variety of image classification tasks but their applications in video classification, namely for human actions, have been less explored. 3D scene reconstruction has made similar advances, progressing from images to videos but has always required some prior knowledge of the physical scene. Within the past year, multiple groups have proposed methods for completely generic scene reconstruction from multiple view cameras. Finally, energy harvesting methods for devices such as cameras and wireless transmitters have been demonstrated to be feasible in laboratory experiments but have not been incorporated into commercial products. In this project the two computer vision algorithms will be developed in parallel with camera hardware so that the software and hardware systems may be integrated and demonstrated by the end of the project.

    and psychomotor activation (energy level). VSI system research will identify measurable
    traits that support rapid learning and successful performance in activities and
    occupations that require teamwork or social skill.  The VSI app collects performance
    data (voice and screen-touch tracks) on mobile devices to investigate novel combinations
    of features from speech and motion that accelerate and improve trait measurement.
    The project will generate new knowledge about how the relationships between speech
    and movement can match expert evaluations of people in work groups and in social
    settings. Measurement technologies developed in the project may also be applied
    in education and industry to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of instruction
    and training."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is about empowering C program developers with correct and complex program transformation tools that they can use to not only improve the quality of C programs but also make the programs more secure against well-known vulnerabilities. C, in spite of its popularity, has integrated development environments (IDEs) with a limited portfolio of such power tools, with limited scalability and limited applicability to real-world programs. Successfully addressing the limitations present in existing tools and providing a robust program transformation infrastructure should fundamentally change how developers work on C code since refactoring is an integral part of software development practices for other programming languages. This will impact both how C programs are written and how they are maintained and evolved. The proposed work also explored behavior-enhancing program transformations that can fix security vulnerabilities in C programs. The work on behavior-enhancing transformations should open a new paradigm of power tools that can be made available to programmers in general (not limited to C programmers).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will foster the development of new algorithms and data structures needed to implement scalable, robust automated program transformation tools for C. It will focus on the parts of this problem that have been inadequately addressed in prior work - specifically, sound handling of the C preprocessor and deep program analysis. At the same time, the work will address the heterogeneity of C platforms, e.g., different dialects, different configurations based on underlying hardware, different IDEs, etc. The Principle Investigator led an NSF-supported research effort to address the research problems in the last three years and has developed a large research prototype (over 500 KLOC). The proposed work brings many of the research results to practice.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of mobile applications by providing developers with better tools for quality assurance of such applications. The results from these tools will enable the developers to take actionable steps to improve and evolve their applications before releasing to customers. This process will also increase developers' confidence in the reliability of their app and will allow them to ship high-quality apps faster. As a result, the average mobile user will have a better mobile experience, thus benefiting all segments of society that rely on mobile computing for their daily activities. From a research perspective, the proposed project will help us understand the practical issues in effectively applying and scaling test generation for mobile applications. Based on the findings, the company will define improved techniques to address such issues and disseminate its results broadly through publications and interactions with industry. Finally, the work will positively influence the next generation of mobile computing development tools by making automated testing more integrated with the development process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project directly addresses the stated goals of the "Information Technologies" topic; it promises to provide fundamental scientific advances by developing both solid theoretical foundations and practical tools that help in improving the functionality and performance of mobile software. Bugs in mobile applications are dependent on the multiple contexts such as user, location, platform etc., leading to several challenges in testing under realistic user conditions. Thus, despite recent research advances in software engineering, app testing is still done by humans, resulting in a tedious and error prone process. This project will lead to the development of novel techniques and a tool (product) that enables, supports and automates the generation of test cases for mobile applications under various conditions. Upon completion, this project will provide unprecedented advantages to developers for reducing their testing costs while effectively finding and addressing app issues. The results of the company's preliminary evaluation are encouraging and motivate further research and development in this area. The company will leverage relationships built during its initial customer discovery to empirically validate the proposed techniques on real world mobile applications.

    This SBIR Phase I Project explores the approach of teaching fundamental engineering concepts through engaging gameplay using a proprietary platform. The platform consists of tiles that can be put together in different ways in 3 dimensions, acting as an input to a game. The game is implemented on a paired device that can be on a tablet or a computer. The player will be presented increasingly difficult challenges and puzzles within game, and will have to use the physical tiles to assist in constructing the solution. The field of engineering exists in 3 dimensions, and the proposed project aims to explore building the intuition of this field within our youngest learners. The broader impact is in the vision for the platform to exist as a means to introduce different STEM topics in a fun and engaging manner, creating fond memories that could lead to more children with an interest in pursuing STEM related fields in the future. The project also has a mission to remain gender neutral in its design, so as to provide games that foster interest in both girls and boys.

    This SBIR Phase I Project will explore, through the use of near field communications, the extension of a proprietary platform that can read and construct data in 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. There is a given theoretical limit to which near field communications are viable, and this project will explore optimizations and additions to the current proprietary solution to achieve a communications distance closer to the theoretical limit. The proprietary system is highly compact, and the project will be researching ways to prevent self interference while improving the range of the system. The main explorations include a look at optimizing off-the-shelf near field communications inlay designs, optimizing the current antenna design and network, and the potential addition of a signal amplifier to boost the range of the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a tool to accelerate the discovery of new autoantibody biomarkers for the early detection and personalized treatment of human diseases.  Autoantibody biomarkers are broadly used to diagnose a variety of conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases and cancers. However, the limited reproducibility, cost and sensitivity of current autoantibody profiling methods frustrate the discovery of new biomarkers to improve management of these diseases. A cost-effective autoantibody profiling platform that is highly sensitive and robust could reveal changes in the autoantibody repertoire that might have been missed by current methods. Such a tool would serve as an invaluable pipeline for the discovery of new biomarkers, augmenting the ability to detect, treat and understand numerous diseases. In the $7.4 Billion/yr biomarker discovery array market, the proposed tool, sold as a service or as micro-arrays kits for client use, meets must-have needs of several customers, including biopharmaceutical companies seeking for new disease targets, improving clinical trials and academic groups pursuing better understanding of human biology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a highly multiplexed and sensitive autoantibody biomarker profiling tool to expedite biomarker discovery. The proposed approach uses agglutination-PCR, a novel technique developed at UC Berkeley and Stanford.  Agglutination-PCR detects autoantibodies in the solution-phase to ensure proper folding of antigen probes while leveraging the sensitivity and multiplex power of standard qPCR instruments. This project employs an innovative synthetic strategy to prepare and optimize a large panel of probes at low cost. While a traditional synthetic route would take up to 3 months, the proposed strategy could reduce the time down to one week. In addition, the probe library for autoantibody detection will be validated using banked serum/plasma from healthy patients or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This experiment will serve as a powerful proof-of-principle, as SLE displays many distinct autoantibodies that are challenging to detect with other methods. The analytical sensitivity and reproducibility of the proposed product will be compared to standard protein microarrays. The platform will be tested to ensure reproducibility and ease-of-use. The probe library and protocols will function as a minimum viable product and the prototype for applications in other diseases.

    educational activities to improve vaccination awareness and understanding. Scientific
    evidence shows that vaccines are effective in preventing infectious diseases such
    as influenza, a contagious respiratory illness. However, despite CDC's recommendation
    for universal influenza vaccination, fewer than 50% of all children in the US,
    and only 1 in 3 of African-American children, are vaccinated each year. The proposed
    activities are designed to educate kids and parents about the benefits of vaccinations,
    in order to increase the number of vaccinated children. Through a tag game and
    wearable devices, participants simulate transmission of influenza, and thereby
    better visualize the health risks of going unvaccinated. The long-term goal is
    to improve the health literacy of young students in a fun and exciting way. Educating
    children about health concepts promotes healthy behaviors, and leads families
    toward better health-related decisions. Improving health literacy, especially
    in a technology-oriented society, is key to developing a thriving population that
    can understand and use new information. The commercial outcome of the proposed
    SBIR project will lead to a marketable product that will be targeted toward hands-on
    museums and has both individual and societal benefits.  \n\nThe scalable educational
    technology in this project will engage children in modeling scientific phenomena
    in a fun and exciting way, while at the same time help them to better understand
    such phenomena. The system uses smartwatches for managing tag games that educate
    children about the benefits of vaccination against influenza. Each participant
    is assigned a health status, such as infectious, healthy, or immune, and then
    runs around to simulate the spread of the flu. Through these participation-based
    activities, students will develop better understandings of the underlying concepts
    of infectious disease transmission, community-level (herd) immunity, and disease
    outbreaks. Similar activities can be used to teach other scientific phenomena
    such as chemical reactions and phase changes. The project will evaluate the effectiveness
    of activities using systematic surveys producing feedback from participants. This
    work fills a market need for educational technology tools that provide powerful
    and memorable learning experiences that not only improve health literacy but also
    foster student interest and confidence in science and math. Educating children
    by exposing them to the sciences, especially in health-related areas, is essential
    to improving wellbeing, and aligns with NSF?s mission of promoting science education."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a 3-dimensional (3D) culture well plate to be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) tool for research and drug discovery.  The core technology is a novel well plate that incorporates micron-meter-sized channels and compartments, and will have the ability to perform autonomous media exchange and drug loading non-invasively in an automated and high-speed fashion. The well plate will allow larger libraries of potential drug candidate compounds to be screened against 3D cultured cells. This would enable pharmaceutical companies and screening centers to increase the probability of finding new drug candidates by elevating the scale and throughput necessary for their discovery and validation. The technology also will increase scientific understanding of cells by providing a tool to study their behavior in an in vivo-like environment, which is important when studying tumor spheroids and exploring cancer therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a 3D cell culture tool by integrating novel microfluidic technology into a well plate format. 3D cell culture is emerging as the next generation drug screening method, as it provides a window into cellular responses by culturing and studying cells in an in vivo-like environment. Currently, however, there are no tools available in the market for testing 3D cultured cells against drug compounds in an HTS fashion. A prototype of the well plate will be fabricated and several important parameters that are required to conduct HTS studies on tumors will be studied. Parameters such as the uniformity in culturing 3D tumors, volume of media required for healthy cellular growth, and effectiveness of the plate to perform screening of drug compounds will be determined. It is anticipated that the microfluidic well plate will create a uniform number of tumors in each microfluidic well and produce results similar to those derived from the current state of the art 3D cell culture platforms. Proprietary patented microfluidic technology developed and verified during the SBIR Phase I project will help integrate 3D cell culture into the mainstream drug discovery cascade.

    Management. Each of these games will illustrate one to two fundamental academic
    concepts by having students engage in short, round-based interactions that last
    less than one classroom session. Recent studies (Burke, 2012; Sitzmann, 2011),
    show that educational games, which focus on key concepts and provide immediate
    feedback to players, help students understand, learn and internalize fundamental
    academic concepts. The project addresses widespread obstacles reported by professors
    to incorporate games into their teaching, including the scarcity of games that
    were both relevant and technically capable in classroom environments. The broader
    impact of the proposed project is an increase in the adoption of pedagogically
    and academically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective
    use of business concepts relevant to managing organizations. Hence, this proposal
    has potential to empower the workforce to be more productive and innovative, thus
    driving U.S. economic growth. Moreover, the eventual opening of the platform to
    a variety of third-party authors will accelerate game innovation and usage in
    other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will enhance

    automatically validated language to eliminate runtime errors in multiplayer Operations
    Management games, which will have been designed using a scientific Game Research
    & Development (GR&D) process for hosting on a web-distribution platform. Debugging
    runtime errors presents a particular challenge for non-professional programmers,
    such as professors. With runtime errors mitigated, the correctness of a program
    can be validated at compile time. Therefore, all games created with the project
    Game Description Language (GDL) will have a guaranteed level of technical quality
    and stability, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance rather than
    technical stability of games. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this
    project employs methods of mainstream video game development, which relies heavily
    on non-professional programmers for storyline scripting. The main technical hurdle
    is that these methods must be tailored to result in automatically validated language
    capable of expressing the range of Operations Management games conceived during
    the GR&D process. The goal of the proposed R&D is a platform prototype able to
    support 10 simultaneous users of four games implemented using the GDL. Pilot tests
    with users will assess critical usability metrics to facilitate further, larger-scale
    testing and GDL improvements in Phase II."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from technology that automatically analyzes network configurations for errors. Computer networks are so tightly woven into the fabric of modern business and society that the delivery of almost all products and services relies on them. Yet networks are notoriously difficult to manage correctly today, and configuration errors that compromise availability, security, and performance are common. Today operators are left to simply wait for bad things to happen and then diagnose and repair the errors as quickly as possible to mitigate the damage. The technology developed in this project will enable organizations to identify network security and availability errors before they are introduced into the running network, thereby saving significant time and money, preventing unauthorized access to customer information, and minimizing down time.  The project will also lead to a better understanding of the most prevalent kinds of network configuration errors and how to design networks to prevent them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will perform the research and development necessary to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a proactive approach to detecting network configuration errors, as instantiated in a software tool. The key innovation underlying the approach is the ability to comprehensively and precisely model and validate the behavior of a network solely by analyzing the network's configuration files. The proposed work has three primary technical goals.  First, configuration languages are extremely diverse and complex, so the tool currently only supports features that have been used by the networks to which it has been applied. A key challenge is to augment the logical model underlying the tool to support other features that are used by real-world networks.  Second, the tool is currently computationally expensive for large networks. Scalability will be improved by leveraging the structure inherent in network configurations and topologies to perform configuration analysis modularly.  Third, to be usable by network operators, the tool must integrate with existing source-control repositories and must provide an expressive interface enabling operators to explore the analysis results.  In summary, these research directions will turn the software tool from a research prototype into an expressive, scalable, and usable tool for analyzing real networks.

    asthma in the US alone. This solution entails an engaging mobile-app game controlled
    by a handheld device that measures lung capacity, which together provide parents
    with an action plan to prevent their child?s asthma symptoms before they occur.
    Guidelines will be developed in consultation with pediatric pulmonologists to
    gain results as reliable as tests conducted under the guidance of a respiratory
    therapist in the hospital. A large database of expert labeled lung measurements
    will be used to train and test the neural network model to detect and decipher
    feature patterns and correlations. If imprecise information is collected, the
    app's machine-learned algorithm will determine the cause of failure and suggest
    a corrective action for the next attempt. This ensures that only properly collected
    lung measurements trigger recommendations for action. By the end of this proposal
    period, the applicant will have a machine learning algorithm on a mobile-app that
    matches the efficacy of in-person coaching by a trained lab technician, as well
    as evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technology for Phase II considerations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the areas of risk management, data collection, and participation/growth in the agricultural sector. With the proposed platform, individuals with investment capital will be paired with individuals who have access to infrastructure and management expertise. This will allow small-scale farmers to invest in other farmers to diversify their operations, creating a more reliable income stream and consequently increasing the stability and resilience of small farms, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. Incentivizing these farmers to upload data to improve projection accuracy will result in more robust datasets that can be used to compare and optimize farming practices. The micro-consortia that will be formed will reduce barriers to entry in the agricultural sector by facilitating remote transactions, contracts, and management. This platform could eventually help farmers in developing countries produce agricultural goods with the financial help and expertise of more established farms in the developed world. By increasing participation in agriculture and improving upon current farming practices around the world, this platform can help feed the world's growing population for years to come.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to generate better agricultural decision making and implementation tools by improving upon existing data sets. Massive amounts of data are being collected by farming operations, but that data is often difficult to manage. This project can help farmers utilize this information by providing visual tools to make advanced data analysis and decision-making more intuitive and user-friendly. The feasibility depends on developing an accurate decision support system as well as providing actionable recommendations to incentivize the use of the tools. The goal of the project is to develop the main simulation tool for a decision support platform, along with easy-to-understand visualizations of different investment projections and their impact on income. Finally, users will be given the ability to act upon the recommendations from the analysis immediately and directly from the analysis platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable data-intensive engineering and science organizations to enhance their data transfer speeds without having to administer premature, costly, and disruptive network upgrades. In addition, the findings and results from this project shed a much needed light to the members of data-intensive communities (both commercial and research) regarding the importance of treating data movement as the 4th critical IT dimension, besides the traditional three: storage, compute, and networking. Furthermore, the project's outcome will show that the 4th-dimension must be defined by balanced interactions of the first three to achieve a desired data transfer speed - an important and elusive concept to grasp, but critical in using high-speed digital communications cost-effectively. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, the product resulting from this project will be far more scalable, space and energy efficient, cost-effective, and easy to deploy and use. Finally, the product will demonstrate that it can meet the data transfer needs of major scientific and commercial endeavors of this decade. This should foster accelerated progress in science and engineering, and thus also the overall national economic health.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need in modern distributed data-intensive engineering and science operations for a 4th IT dimension - data movement - besides storage, compute, and networking. To match the exponential data-growth trend, the product resulting from this project will provide high-performance data transfer and encryption. The design balances and scales in: IOPS, computation power, and network interfaces. It has a cluster-oriented architecture, using peer-to-peer technologies to ease deployment, operation, and usage. Two patent-pending algorithms help tackle data sets containing a mix of small files and very large files, and provide insensitivity to network latency. Its unique optimizations enable effective use of flash storage. The project will develop a simple, effective, and scale-out capable storage tiering software, a scale-out high-speed data encryption approach, and a scale-out approach for implementing more efficient storage I/O intensive applications. It is anticipated that data rates between two existing Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) front ending parallel data file systems will be comparable with those from two commonly used high performance data transfer applications. With two four-node clusters, the product is anticipated to achieve 155Gbps memory-to-memory over a 16x10Gbps aggregated link and 70Gbps file-to-file with encryption over a 5000 mile 100Gbps link.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a technology called luminescent solar concentration that will extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized yet because previous tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project aims to provide a solutions to these problems with a novel low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on discovering new improvements in efficiency and cost reduction of the quantum dots. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned coal needed to generate electricity.


    The technical innovation in this project is the development of an ideal window-tint material that will be used to transform windows into electricity generating components of urban buildings. Luminescent solar concentrators are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like photoluminescent dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots, which are interesting due to their easily tunable light emission, are more stable, but are expensive, toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimized for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. In this SBIR Phase I project CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots will be optimized for higher photoluminescence efficiency >50% and applied as industry-compatible coatings to glass substrates for higher performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will arise from the development and release of the world's first open source Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) platform. The platform will be made available to the world as open source software free of charge, and will be surrounded by a set of commercial offerings that include the deployment and customization of the software as well as software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings that will allow users of the platform to painlessly create and deploy IVAs. Beyond the commercial applications of IVA technology, the open source release of the platform will help foster a healthy, active open source community around the IVA technology, allowing it to be leveraged as a machine learning research platform and accelerating IVA adoption in important non-commercial settings such as non-profit education and improving technological access for the disabled.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the significant computer systems challenges involved in seamlessly orchestrating the massive amounts of computation among complex pipelines of algorithmic components required to power intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) technologies. The computation required to power IVAs is large enough that such software systems will likely run in large datacenter infrastructures comprised of complex ecosystems of different server types and accelerator platforms. This project will address these challenges by building a centralized software mechanism within the IVA platform for monitoring job execution to facilitate efficiently mapping sub-tasks within the IVA computation to the available hardware resources in the datacenter.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project is designed to address the dramatic drop
    in US student proficiency happening in the middle school grades. Seen across years
    of international test data, this drop highlights the urgent need to prepare students
    for success in the math classroom. Without a solid foundation in math, US students
    cannot succeed in science, technology and engineering. They will be less likely
    to graduate high school, will struggle to succeed in college, and are at risk
    of being left behind in a global economy. Many look to technology to address this
    challenge - but the 22 million US students struggling in mathematics do not need
    yet another virtual tutorial, online lecture or more practice time on a computer
    doing textbook-based math problems. What they need is a simulator. A comprehensive
    simulator where they can see, hear and experience just how math works - and why
    it matters. This project would develop an innovative product that delivers interactive
    video challenge math problems, aligned to Common Core State Standards for 5th
    through 8th grade mathematics, into any classroom. \n\nThis product will use a
    complex programming system and codebase to allow teachers to collect student data
    and responses to complex math problems that result in functional output, accepting
    rapid real-time responses from multiple student devices, that can range from computers
    to mobile phones, in a low-bandwidth environment. Within the product, teachers
    generate tasks and challenges for students; students would grapple with multi-step
    problems and provide answers, with the teacher maintaining ultimate control over
    what is  shared out with the classroom as a whole when the simulation is played
    out. Student data and responses are captured and are connected directly to a robust
    learning management system. The product is anticipated to be highly effective
    by providing students with an opportunity for Productive Failure (PF) prior to
    instruction; PF shows a higher effect size for both conceptual learning and transfer
    to novel situations than typical approaches where instruction is provided first.
    The Phase I project will conduct preliminary research using an experimental design
    to determine effect size of student growth from use of the intervention on a single
    CCSS standard."

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a cloud-based E-Learning platform providing hands-on labs and personalized learning support for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.  Hands-on labs have become an indispensable part of curriculum components for STEM education. There is a high demand for students to practice real-world problems through hands-on labs; moreover, hands-on labs should provide adaptive and personalized learning capability for students to adjust their learning paths and contents to achieve desired study outcomes more effectively. However, the main issues of providing hands-on labs are in two-fold: (1) high lab management overhead for instructors; and (2) lack of user-behavior learning models that can be used for personalized learning in an experimental setup. In this SBIR Phase I project, we will develop a platform providing a cloud-based virtual laboratory solution that minimizes the lab management overhead, and tracks users' hands-on learning behavior to provide personalized learning support in order to improve students' learning outcomes. The presented solution will have great impacts for a broader population from K-12 to higher education.

    The novelty of the proposed research lies in the technology innovations by conducting research in the following areas: (1) a Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based approach to support Private Network and Network Security as a Service (PNaaS and NSaaS) model for cloud resource provisioning in a highly dynamic virtualized learning environment; (2) a pure web-based service model to guide students' lab experiments based on cybersecurity knowledge bases and concept maps; (3) learning behavior tracking and modeling to collect and represent students' diverse learning activities for cybersecurity learning based on ICAP (Interactive, Constructive, Active and Passive) features which describe student?s cognitive engagement to discern different levels of engagement as overt behaviors; and (4) build-in self-assessment services to measure users' learning outcomes. The research goal of this SBIR I project will address the challenges on how to create a scalable E-Learning environment to provide resources (computing, storage, networking, education contents, and personalized learning guidance) to a large number of learners and educators who have different system resources and learning setup requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance societal goals such as protection of life and property, protection against lost revenue and improved planning by providing a technically innovative product to help operational forecasters create better weather forecasts. The explosive growth in the availability of high-performance computing clusters has significantly increased the amount of forecast data available to operational meteorologists. Making sense of all of the available data in a timely fashion has become difficult and the market exists for products that streamline this process. Any improvement in weather forecasting will have direct and indirect positive effects for businesses and society by increasing safety, helping in daily and weekly planning, helping to mitigate storm related expenses and helping businesses avoid weather-related expenses that can then trickle down as cost-savings for the customer. The technology will allow forecasters to produce better forecasts more quickly and will be valuable in operational settings at national weather centers, to individual users, and in a host of commercial applications such as energy, agriculture, and media.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of operationally synthesizing multiple streams of global, regional, and ensemble weather model forecast data in real-time to provide a streamlined product of model performance and then use that information to create new global or regional forecast maps. The complexity of accessing and analyzing vast amounts of forecast data creates a significant challenge to the operational forecaster. Analysis of all available forecast data is difficult since forecasters are under pressure to process the data in a short amount of time. Furthermore, the analysis is usually subjective. The proposed technology will ameliorate these issues by creating a model performance and forecast product that consolidates a majority of forecast data into one, easy-to-use interface. The goal of the project is to provide operational forecasters with a tool that gives an objective look at model performance with minimal effort and provides them with a new forecast product that is better than any single model.

    This SBIR Phase I project will enable a high-performance, large particle size silicon anode for integration in SiILion's proprietary high energy Li-ion system. While rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the portable electronics market for nearly a decade, they have failed to gain widespread commercial success in high power and high capacity applications due to material limitations. Demand for a battery providing 400 Wh/kg, 700 Wh/L (almost double the specific energy of current state-of-the art lithium-ion batteries) is growing. Reaching the performance demands of next-generation Li-ion batteries will require breakthroughs in next-generation electrode materials. If successful in enabling its proposed 900 Wh/L technology, SiILion could offer the public an opportunity to own an affordable, safe, environmentally conscious vehicle while also providing safe, high energy batteries for applications ranging from consumer electronics to grid storage. Moreover, SiILion's high energy battery technology has major implications in the aerospace and defense industries, providing a non-flammable battery for vehicular and on-person applications. In the race to develop the next successful Li-ion technology, the U.S. economy stands to gain; SiILion's proposed Li-ion battery system provides an opportunity for the U.S. to own high impact battery technology and reclaim a leadership position in the Li-ion market.

    Most research aimed towards enabling next-generation electrode materials, both in academia and industry, focuses on expensive material modification. Conversely, SiILion is working to enable low-cost and scalable electrode materials using a new class of electrolyte: room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). In order to truly realize a low-cost and scalable bulk-type Si anode, the incorporation of larger Si particles needs to be achieved. Micron-scale silicon (Micro-Si) is the ideal anode material for low cost and high capacity, but a full-cell incorporating Micro-Si has never been demonstrated commercially or in academia because of complications stemming from the material's expansion during lithiation. Upon optimizing the micron-Si anode in an RTIL electrolyte, the following areas will be investigated: (1) overall electrode thickness change upon lithiation and delithiation, (2) characterization of electrode mechanism and material morphology throughout cycling, (3) development of full-cells in a coin cell configuration, and (4) development of full-cells in a large-format configurations. This SBIR Phase I project will, for the first time demonstrate a working Micro-Si anode in a Li-ion full-cell, through the optimization of the electrode architecture and its accompanying electrolyte composition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on furthering scientific understanding of degradation in electrochemical energy storage. The project will explore technology that will enable the large-scale transfer of a key laboratory-proven diagnostic tool from the lab to the field. This tool, called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), is a noninvasive assessment of the internal state of a battery. In contrast to current interest-group-initiated, crowd-sourced qualitative research efforts, EIS would enable the collection and analysis of an unprecedented amount of real-time quantitative data to further scientific understanding of electrochemical lifetime and degradation factors of in applications ranging from electric vehicles to grid and building storage. Highly publicized battery pack failures have increased skepticism of electrochemical energy storage in the public eye, and large-scale scientific studies could aid in faster technological improvements to increase widespread adoption of electrochemical energy storage as the U.S. seeks to improve energy independence, efficiency, and security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need to innovate on current battery management methods that force battery system overdesign and power/energy underutilization by introducing a platform to enable diagnosis and correction of inherent cell-to-cell imbalances in electric vehicles to improve battery pack performance, reliability, and safety. Specifically, this work deploys electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a distributed power electronics platform to provide a new toolset for real-time diagnostics and the improved extraction of important information to aid in the determination of battery cell state of charge and state of health. The goal of Phase I Research is to demonstrate efficient and cost-effective scalability of this power-electronics-based EIS. A proof-of-concept prototype has been verified on small-capacity cells, but a commercial solution will need to manage large-capacity cells with much lower impedance which presents control system and EIS accuracy technical challenges. A power converter and accompanying control system will first be developed to meet target specifications, followed by a demonstration board to demonstrate EIS and power management for a number of series-connected cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to address the problem of data interpretation, one of the most important and fastest growing issues caused by the influx of wearable technologies. As with all technology, wearable devices are increasing in popularity and decreasing in cost every day. Businesses rushing to catch this wave of technology paradigm are met with the complex problem of how to interpret the data gathered in a way that is accurate and useful to consumers. Many of these businesses are companies with products that were previously completely unrelated with computer or smartphone technologies. As such, they do not have the in-house expertise to not only correctly gather such data, but then analyze it for patterns that could be deemed useful in identifying behavior or conditions for the consumer. By providing a boxed solution that makes machine learning based data analysis possible for the average engineer, our project is aimed to help these businesses cross that hurdle.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project seeks to bring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems for use in the hands of non-data/computer scientists. While machine learning and AI techniques are widely used these days in many applications ranging from Google search to Uber rides, they remain fairly esoteric topics with a high learning curve just to understand, let alone apply. We plan to address this issue differently from previous competitors by building a highly intuitive web UI on top of our existing hardware sensor platform. This allows us to leverage the data gathering and processing consistency of our hardware, along with our proprietary SDKs to ensure properly labelled and clean data. As a result, we will have a much easier time developing basic digital processing filters as well as applying machine learning techniques to the data in order to solve generic classification problems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is development and application of networked medical implants. The team will conduct an in-depth feasibility study to develop a proof-of-concept prototype of an ultrasonic Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) miniaturized embedded system. Enclosed in a titanium biocompatible casing, this platform will be the basis of implantable medical devices with ultrasonic wireless connectivity and will be applied to multiple therapies in the human and veterinary spaces. Patients will benefit from implants that provide real-time wireless telemetry and reprogrammability while minimally affecting the implant battery life, therefore reducing device/battery replacements that are often complex and costly. Real-time continuous monitoring may also improve the clinical outcome for several therapies providing patients with real- time information about physiological parameters (e.g., glucose or pacemaker readings). This will reduce time-consuming and expensive in-office visits and hospitalizations. The IoMT platform will also enable the development of advanced therapies that require wireless reliable communication through tissues between multiple implantable sensing and stimulating devices. From a security perspective, the IoMT will eliminate electromagnetic compatibility concerns of a crowded radio-frequency (RF) spectrum. It is therefore safer and transparent to the RF spectrum management procedures of healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop the first proof-of-concept prototype of an ultrasonic Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform, a miniaturized, biocompatible implantable device with ultrasonic wireless communication capabilities. In the near future, wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many revolutionary therapies. However, biological tissues absorb radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves, which are the basis of wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. As a consequence, higher transmission power is needed to establish reliable links, which reduces the battery lifetime of an implantable device. The IoMT platform will offer wireless connectivity through a new and proprietary technology based on ultrasonic waves that is a safer, more secure, and lower-power alternative to RF-based technologies. The project team will conduct four research tasks to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the device: (i) explore best practices to design the core architecture of the IoMT platform; (ii) discover techniques for energy performance optimization; (iii) define best practices for powering the device; (iv) integrate and test components on a custom printed circuit board. Throughout these tasks, the team will recognize and address design tradeoffs between form factor, biocompatibility of materials, communication performance, and power consumption.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed to develop, test and validate a retractable telescopic structural wall for applications in flood protection.  This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Climate change is creating a problem for coastal cities and local communities in proximity to large bodies of water. Population centers tend to be located near such bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general. The addressable market size for this technology is estimated at $2.6 billion.  The proposed concept, when validated, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. The goals of the proposed research surround the detailed design of the mechanisms, determination of a geometric configuration and material mix to achieve a high strength-to-weight ratio, and the execution of laboratory experimentation and field tests on physical working prototypes. The plan to accomplish these goals starts with the development of numerical simulations and an analytical framework. Results will be validated via laboratory tests where lateral and vertical loads, as well as impact loads, will be applied.  Field tests of the specimens will also be conducted to determine the effects of soil type on performance.  These field tests will serve as well to simulate realistic still flood water conditions.  The anticipated technical result of Phase I is a working prototype of the telescopic structural flood wall with extension and retraction capabilities, and with the structural capability to withstand the forces from flood events with minimal to no damage.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable thermal imaging solutions across a multitude of everyday applications.  More specifically, this project will make thermal imaging accessible to the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, which will spur advancements in public safety, advanced health monitoring, and energy and water conservation, all of which will further drive economic development.  Long Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) radiation propagates through common obscurants such as dust, smoke and fog, so thermal imaging cameras can enhance transportation safety under inclement conditions. For example, cameras mounted in automobiles or along railways will protect vehicle occupants and pedestrians by helping prevent collisions. The same benefits will also improve safety and increase efficacy of police, firefighters and EMTs. Finally, remotely monitored cameras will increase independence of elderly and high medical risk individuals while respecting their privacy as LWIR images preserve the anonymity of the subject.  Finally, thermal imaging-equipped smart appliances can regulate lighting and HVAC delivery based upon occupancy detection to reduce residential and commercial energy consumption. In agriculture, thermal imaging can be used in conjunction with data processing to conserve water and direct the use of pesticides and fertilizer more efficiently.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has the potential to advance the frontiers of knowledge in the areas of micro-fabrication, Long Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) optics, wafer level camera assembly, and reduced form factor thermal imaging cameras. The LWIR lens technology leverages advancements from the semiconductor and MEMS / MOEMS industries to enable never before realized lens topologies.   The lens technology pursued in this project will replace traditional germanium or chalcogenide glass lenses, which are expensive to manufacture and bulky.  The unique lens design and fabrication approach further enable Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) and Wafer-Level Optics (WLO), which extend the state-of-the-art by allowing, for the first time, the lens to be assembled on to the thermal imaging array at the wafer-level rather than at the individual die level, which results in significant reduction in cost, size and weight.  This research will involve lens design and fabrication, lens assembly on to a thermal imaging array, and finally, testing and benchmarking of the camera performance.  Finally, this project advances the study and usage of dielectric metamaterials by developing custom predictive models for using Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations as an input for traditional ray tracing optical design software.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the improvement in the quality of life for older adults currently affected by falls. Every year over 700,000 older adults are hospitalized in the United States due to fall-related injuries, which result in $34B in direct medical costs. The proposed technology will reduce first and future falls by providing an older adult's medical treatment team (e.g., physician, physical therapist, etc.) with fall history and ambulatory information.  Fall histories are difficult to obtain and unreliable (as many occurrences are not self-reported). The underlying technological development can be further expanded to allow smart buildings to behave as "first responders" and aid their occupants during man-made and natural disasters. Extensions of this technology have potential in many fields, including efficient energy management systems, security and threat detection, emergency response and evacuation, and structural health monitoring. The proposed technology respects privacy while enabling significant improvement in infrastructure intelligence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art lifestyle-monitoring system for older adults in assisted homes that has a comprehensive approach towards fall prevention and detection. The healthcare industry has invested significant resources in predicting falls based on the number of previous falls, but current healthcare professional's access to individual patient fall history is limited due to unreliable self-reporting. Additionally, research has shown that the risk of future falls can be greatly reduced through timely preventative treatments. This prevention is achieved by indirectly monitoring the physical activity and falls of older adults through floor-mounted accelerometers coupled with data analytics processing. This analysis studies inherent patterns in recorded data of events such as falls, walking, door slams, etc. Prediction is made possible through the recording of the unreported falls and health history. The anticipated output of this system is a means of detecting falls, locating them, and effective historical data storage, which will result in a more accurate future risk evaluation of the older adult.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that the model of a universal, user-facing commercially run "commons" results in an easier to use dynamic and creative Internet of Things, with more power for users and more sales for manufacturers. The commons allows devices of many protocols to publish, subscribe and react to updates from one other in a way that is open to manufacturers and visible/comprehensible to normal Internet Users. Most of the largest Internet companies (including in auctions, social media and ecommerce) constitute conceptually similar models in which a central entity helps support the relationships between consumers, or between consumers and manufacturers/sellers. This project aims to bring similar efficiencies, power and ease of use to the network-connected devices of the next few decades, with a view to capturing some of the value it creates for manufacturers and users in the process (as e-commerce, social media and auctions platforms have before).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on creating interoperability between all devices at the level of a user interface and in such a way that a normal Internet User can understand. At present, limited sub-sets of devices may be interoperable at some levels of their protocol, and may be able to react to one or extend their networks. But this interoperability does not extend to all devices, and it does not extend to the user interface. A normal person cannot make any two devices interact with one another without resorting to computer programming. The project proposes that the creation of a centralized real-time-messaging-based "commons" in which devices (i) publish their status in both human readable language and a parallel extensible data format, and (ii) can register ways for their major functions to be triggered which creates a space in which any device can react to state changes in another. The project aims to demonstrate that (i) the core statuses of devices can be expressed and easily published in these real-time human-readable/data messages, that (ii) the data structure can comprise both core data types and a looser, name-spaced set of data types, that (iii) a real-time rules engine can trigger a device to action when a set of arbitrary criteria occur, and that (iv) these criteria and responses can be created through a comparatively simple user interface.

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is the development of a low-cost process to mitigating nitrate, a ubiquitous pollutant that is steadily eroding the quality and availability of safe potable water all around the world. This novel process combines and sequences electrochemistry, aqueous chemical reactions, solid oxide formation and surface adsorption processes into a simple continuous-flow unit to achieve high levels of nitrate removal; optimization will be guided by computational techniques that lend themselves to discovery of new materials that may also demonstrate breakthrough potential for other critical fields such as fuel treatment and large scale energy storage. The project offers an opportunity to apply interdisciplinary solutions to complex societal problems and will yield a self-contained unit, inexpensive to build and operate, scalable, modular and reliable.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop an inexpensive water treatment module for selective removal of nitrate from aqueous media. The module employs a novel sequence of electrochemically controlled processes to promote in situ formation and ripening of metal hydrous oxide crystals, with documented adsorptive effectiveness, readily separating them from continuously flowing water. The primary objectives of this project are refining and addressing the high risk aspects of this methodology, merging field experience with concepts from published papers, sequencing processes and regulating conditions in novel ways, enhancing adsorption properties while mitigating interferences by oxyanions.  The technology will advance understanding of metal hydrous oxides and the kinetics of their formation, which may well inform creation of other inexpensive processes for simultaneous removal of multiple problematic pollutants, potentially recovering them for commercial re-use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I projec is wide ranging due to the flexibility of the laser source design. The goal of the proposed work is an innovative approach to the development of a new class of compact, low cost, high-power laser sources at wavelengths that are currently difficult to achieve while providing addition functionality with no additional power consumption. This will make a highly efficient laser package. In addition to the application rich mid-IR, the laser design can easily be extended to other wavelengths in the far-IR, THz, visible, and UV portions of the spectrum. The approach can have a significant impact in many technical fields. The discoveries made within the scope of this program will have a transformative impact in mid- to far-IR lasers and has the ability to benefit disciplines including: laser surgery, dental surgery, dermatology, atmospheric monitoring, chemical sensing, and a broad range of defense applications including LADAR and laser range finding. In addition to the technological impact, the proposed research will cover multiple disciplines in science and engineering including high energy material properties, semiconductor physics, nonlinear optics and laser physics which will provide a unique research opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for versatile laser sources operating in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral region. Currently available lasers sources are limited in their capabilities. Wavelength selection and maximum output powers are limited, and efficiency, reliability and costs are also issues. High-power vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers (VECSEL) which employs multiple chip arrangements have the potential to reach wavelengths that are not easily attainable in a very compact package. In addition, the introduction of multiple laser cavities provides a means for generating outputs in the near-IR with no additional power consumption. Using a high power doubly-resonant two-color T-cavity VECSEL, efficient difference frequency conversion will be achieved. High power outputs in the mid-IR (8-12 µm) spectral region will be demonstrated through a novel design in which the VECSEL chips will contain multiple laser cavities that can provide broad spectral coverage in the near-IR from the same device. This will lead to enhanced efficiency and provide more capabilities such as laser targeting and range finding with no additional power consumption.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve imaging systems used in surveying and surveillance. Specifically, the project intends to overcome the long range resolution problems created by air turbulence which is the primary limitation on resolution at long distances. The project anticipates creating a light weight, ultra-high resolution camera system deployable on land, sea and air drones to speed search & rescue, identify crop diseases, improve oil and mineral exploration success, rapidly identify infrastructure problems and improve homeland security operations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the limitations placed on long range imaging by air turbulence using a novel non-classical approach. Using sun as the light source, this camera may achieve a spatial resolution of 200 micrometers for any object on Earth, which is insignificant for short distance imaging, however, taking a picture of a target at 10-kilometer, a classic camera must have a lens of 90-meter diameter to achieve a theoretical 200-micrometer resolution. Thus, the turbulence free camera will provide "panoramic" photographs with micron-level resolution at large distances. The research will convert a successful lab scale camera system performing non-classical imaging into a fully functional prototype for use in real world environments.

    of mind for those individuals sensitive to peanuts and their families, friends,
    schools, and restaurants, 4) reduce and/or eliminate the number of institutional

    annually and peanut is a major contributor. The proposed allergen-reduced peanut
    may provide a significant solution to peanut allergy with the potential to reduce
    the overall cost of food allergy.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to
    produce a commercial prototype for an allergen-reduced peanut. In previous works,
    concomitant down regulation of the 3 most potent allergens Ara h1, Ara h2 and
    Ara h3 was demonstrated and resulted in 2 to 25 fold reduction in allergenic potency.
    The allergen-reduced trait was transmitted to four successive generations in the
    progeny in field trials. However, the populations of transgenic seeds were not
    homogeneous; they displayed variable levels of allergenic potency among pods from
    the same plant. To solve this problem, an alternative transformation method based
    on Repetitive Somatic Embryogenesis is proposed to produce new sets of transgenic
    peanut plants devoid of chimerism. During this Phase I project, molecular, biochemical
    and immunological analyses will be performed to confirm the new sets of transgenic
    peanut plant lines are chimera-free, and a commercial prototype for the allergen-reduced
    peanut will be identified."

    Transfer (STTR) project will be to transform the current models for bone marrow-
    and cord blood-derived cell therapies and make cell therapy, especially the patients'
    own cells, more widely available for use by healthcare providers and patients.
    Two major technical hurdles in the regenerative medicine field have prevented
    the translation of cell therapy from the bench to the bedside, despite the huge
    surge in clinical trials being conducted worldwide: 1) The lack of devices for
    the isolation of native clinically active bone marrow or cord blood derived cells
    without gradient selection and centrifugation that lead to cell loss and decreased
    cell viability; and 2) The logistical hurdles of cell isolation and processing
    in \"centralized\" cell production facilities. The prevalent approaches involve
    the collection of patient tissues such as bone marrow samples at hospitals, transport
    of samples to the central cell production facilities, isolation and expansion
    of cells using different protocols, and transporting the cell product back to
    the hospital sites for transplantation into patients. Every step of this cell
    therapy and transplantation process is expensive, involves multiple teams and
    poses a potential risk for introducing contamination, cellular loss and other
    complications. The technology proposed in this project is incorporated in a device
    that has the potential to overcome these two hurdles. The device allows the derivation
    of adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs) that are native or minimally manipulated,
    in a GMP-compliant process for isolation and delivery of cells for cell therapy
    applications in hospitals and outpatient clinics, thereby circumventing transportation
    requirement and central facility processing and making cell therapy more widely
    available. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to overcome the hurdles in the
    regenerative medicine field by developing a device that enables GMP-grade stem
    cell processing in a functionally closed system. This project will validate GMP-grade
    isolation of the fraction of the bone marrow, the adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs)
    for use in cell therapy applications, initially for spinal cord injuries. While
    the ultimate goal is to conduct IND enabling studies, this Phase I grant objectives
    covers: 1) GMP-compliant coating of the device surface with matrix molecules and
    validation for efficient collection of ABMCs, 2) Post processing validation of
    ABMC sample integrity. Since the device also has a provision component for freezing
    of the processed samples, objective 3) is to validate ABMC freezing and cell recovery.
    Safety assays will include sterility and end product monitoring. Non-retrospective
    flow cytometry assays will be utilized to analyze CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90,
    CD105, CD106, CD166, and CD271 expression, essential markers that distinguish
    ABMCs. Higher percentages of CD106 and CD271 are expected for ABMCs. The potential
    for CFU-F formation, along with adipogenic, osteogenic and neuronal potentials
    of ABMCs will be examined and compared with standard mesenchymal stem cells. The
    collection of bone marrow cells with superior regenerative potentials, as indicated
    with previous pilot studies, is anticipated."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase I project is the capability to enable small- and medium-sized commercial buildings to operate more efficiently and facilitate their participation in electricity markets. It will result in energy consumption reduction in buildings, thus providing savings in electricity bills and lowering carbon footprints, without compromising occupant comfort. The proposed platform also enables revenue generation by allowing buildings to participate in ancillary electricity markets and respond to pricing or demand response signals from electric utilities. By integrating intelligent energy management and automatic demand response features to the traditional building operation, this helps electric utility companies to avoid/defer extensive upgrades of their electrical infrastructures, such as generation, transmission or distribution facilities, with the growing demand for electricity. The proposed software platform demonstrates the benefits of building automation to building owners/operators, and provides them the ability to cross-reference their buildings with best practices in building operations. It also bridges the knowledge transfer process between a small business and an institution of higher education by facilitating both sides to meet, work and exchange experiences with each other.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is built on an agent-based platform for building automation systems where advanced algorithms enable the software platform to be proactive and help optimize building operations. It can also perform fault detection, diagnostics and predictive maintenance, integrate emerging Internet of Things (IoT) devices and enable buildings to interact with the grid in an intelligent manner. Under the proposed project, a reinforced machine-learning algorithm will be developed that uses historical building energy consumption data and ambient conditions - including occupant preferences - to optimize building operations based on usage patterns of major loads and power sources in each zone of the building. Another major research contribution lies in novel algorithms that enable buildings to transact with the grid. These allow buildings to respond to system stress conditions and electricity price signals by automatically adjusting the operation of major loads and internal generating sources. Overall, the proposed software platform allows a building to optimize its operation, perform peak demand management during grid stress conditions, and participate in ancillary service markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring a disruptive Light Emitting Diode (LED) assembly technology closer to commercialization and enable the creation of a transformative, low cost manufacturing platform needed to manufacture future efficient high resolution LED displays as well as other complex integrated electronic systems. This project's success will revolutionize large-area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to significant improvements in display quality, while achieving large reductions in display energy consumption, just as high efficiency LEDs have dramatically reduced energy consumption in lighting systems. Direct view all-LED displays offer superior viewing quality and high resolution at significant energy savings over current LCD and OLED technologies. There is a huge demand for information displays of increasing higher resolution, but LED display manufacturers face a very high cost in LED packaging.  This new LED assembly technology can drastically reduce the LED packaging cost by an order of magnitude for extremely high quality LED displays. This technology can also be extended to the assembly of any other types of small semiconductor die components on large area substrates for systems, such as solar systems, flexible electronics, and distributed networked electronic surfaces.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and help commercialize a radically new technology for high speed, high precision assembly of small LEDs for manufacturing energy efficient, high performance direct view  Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays. This patent-pending technology overcomes the limitations of incumbent pick-and-place technologies and wafer-scale stamping technologies currently in development. This assembly tool is considerably simpler and less expensive, while achieving much higher assembly rates for almost any LED size, pixel pitch and display dimensions. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the commercialization viability of this technology with well characterized baseline processes. A set of process metrics and scaling rules will be established for future product development. This project will result in a prototype assembly system and a LED display demo to demonstrate the value proposition of this technology for the LED display manufacturing industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a medical device that accelerates wound healing and prevents infection.  Wound contamination and infection are notoriously challenging to treat and are a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and other microbial colonization in wounds delay healing, cause further degradation, and can lead to severe complications including deep tissue and bone infections, as well as stroke and sepsis. The wound care field is large and diverse and includes acute and chronic wounds, pre- and post-surgical care and scar prevention, burns, as well as emergency wound care in war settings and homeland security. Due to the aging population and increasing rates of diabetes and obesity, the entire global wound care products market is expanding rapidly at an estimated 7% per year and currently totals over $21B. Moreover, new financial reimbursement policies to reduce the estimated $50B US economic burden of wounds are incentivizing hospitals to improve care, reduce infection, and accelerate patient recovery. The market is ripe for a medical technology that treats wound infections.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a high voltage power supply capable of driving a cold plasma medical device that treats wound infections. Cold plasma is ideal for treating wound infections because it is effective against all bacteria types and is unlikely to confer bacterial resistance. It is superior in its anti-microbial effect compared to topical antibiotics and antiseptics but safe for human skin. Our research objectives include scaling the output voltage, shortening pulse width, enabling thermal, overvoltage, and overcurrent protections, and incorporating voltage control feedback. Anticipated technical results include completion of these research objectives and testing of the power supply with the cold plasma device on bacterial cultures to confirm antibacterial effects.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish to achieve robust solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Currently available ENIG surface finishes are prone to so-called "black pads", which are sites of galvanic hyper corrosion that lead to failures associated with de-wetting of solder, brittle solder joints, component disconnection, and overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Existing substitute surface finishes are either very expensive or do not resolve the black pad defects fully, and they can compromise other key properties. The cost-effective novel ENIG to be developed will eliminate black pads, corrosion related issues, achieve robust solder joints and provide improved quality & reliability of electronic assembly products to end consumers. This will allow manufacturers to avoid major product field failures and the resulting consequences. This new technology would be a potential replacement for existing ENIG (with a market value in excess of $400 million) and other surface finishes (representing a market exceeding $1 billion).

    The intellectual merit of this project includes development of a cost-effective novel ENIG to eliminate black pads and achieve robust solder joints. The root cause of black pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity of the immersion gold process which originates at intergranular boundaries and crevices of the nickel-phosphorous surface.  Galvanic hyper-corrosion occurs between gold and nickel atoms, resulting in nickel depletion and an enrichment of phosphorous atoms in the localized area.  The proposed research would use an interfacial engineering approach at the gold and nickel-phosphorous interfaces to prevent black pads and eliminate brittle solder failures in the electronic assemblies. The main objective of the proposed Phase I research is to achieve marked improvement in corrosion resistance (eliminate black pads) and attain robust solder joints (eliminate brittle solder joint failures). This will involve identifying right interfacial chemistry and process parameters.  Corrosion resistance of this new process will be evaluated using electrochemical corrosion tests and acid tests.  In addition, solder joint strength and properties (brittle/ductile) will be investigated using ball shear tests and cold ball pull tests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to streamline and reduce the cost of manufacturing biopharmaceuticals by developing a heterologous protein expression system for large scale batch and continuous flow fermentation systems. Currently, many large molecule therapeutics, such as insulin, are made using bacterial host organisms. These cells are genetically engineered to produce large quantities of a desired product, known as a recombinant protein, in the cellular compartments of these single-celled organisms. However, due to the small size of bacteria and its unfavorable physiology, these products often end up interfering with production and require additional costs and effort to then extract, purify and activate the product. The T3S system is the most efficient known protein secretion system in bacteria, and could enable rapid export of recombinant proteins, allowing for these products to be produced in a favorable environment and negate the need for extraction, exhaustive purification, and costly reactivation of the product.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the a protein expression system based on the bacterial Type-III Secretion (T3S) system for use in scalable fermenters to maximize the yield output. The goal is to test different media types as well as different growth and expression conditions, and then quantify the amount of secreted protein through various techniques. Additionally, this Phase I project will develop for the first time a continuous flow manufacturing process with a bacterial production system for greater efficiency, and further reduce the cost and effort associated with recombinant protein production. Due to the T3S systems' rapid and direct secretion of products directly into the supernatant a new filtration system to continually harvest the spent media for product will be employed. In addition, the purity of the secreted products directly from the spent media will be characterized to determine what additional purification steps are required. Finally, the T3S system unfolds proteins as they are secreted into the oxidative media lead by their N-terminus, in the same manner that they are translated by the ribosome. This maximizes the possibility for proteins to form into their native and active confirmation, which will be verified using LC-MS techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be improved capabilities of current hearing assistive cochlear implants through the development of a miniature implantable robotic system. It will enable many more patients with hearing loss to retain their hearing capacity much longer over their lifetimes. Hearing loss has a significant impact on physical and mental health, education, employment, and overall quality of life, and has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and feelings of depression, frustration, anxiety, and social isolation. 53 million people have severe-to-profound hearing loss and are eligible for traditional cochlear implants, but there are an additional 300 million with partial-to-moderate disabling hearing loss who are not eligible for a traditional implant and do not significantly benefit from other hearing assistive devices alone. The development of this technology will enable a much wider population of those with hearing loss to receive the benefits of a cochlear implant, using a novel wireless control and the added convenience of personalized hearing loss treatment regimens. This technology will also facilitate commercial opportunities for use of the implantable robotic system in other applications where an implantable electrode/wire requires precise and dynamic remote position adjustments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop and test a prototype of an implantable robotic system that wirelessly optimizes cochlear implant function and enables clinician adjustments as patient hearing deteriorates. Though traditional cochlear implants are used to treat severe-profound hearing loss, recent advances in hearing preservation technologies have allowed those with partial hearing loss, such as from noise exposure or aging, to benefit from cochlear implants. Unfortunately, clinical trials have found that more than 50% of these recipients experience continued hearing deterioration after cochlear implantation. Treatment options are limited to additional surgery for electrode replacement or living with limited hearing because the implants cannot be adjusted. This research is focused on developing an implantable robotic control system that will enable cochlear implants to dynamically adjust to post-surgical hearing decline without the need for additional surgery. In Phase I, individual components will be assembled into a functioning implantable robotic system that meets design and surgical size requirements to effectively move an electrode within a human cadaveric cochlea model. Anticipated results will include a prototype that has a novel micromechanical system for electrode adjustments, wireless communications for external control, and safe transcutaneous power.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing better method for connected systems and devices to interact with each other. Current solutions require many months of development and cost of development and maintenance can be overwhelming.  The proposed technology offers a way for interaction between systems and devices to be configured rather than programmed. The technology also provides a way for services to be configured by the user, rather than relying on developers to create nodes or connectors.  This is made possible through abstracting out the interaction layer of software stack and creating a generic algorithm for interaction to be configured. Much like when routers first came out, technology of abstracting out a portion of software stack opens up opportunity for market to perform tasks that once were programmer dependent.  Abstraction of router code enabled growth of Internet. We believe abstraction of Interaction code will enable IoT to be widely deployed. Societal impact is achieved through large number of interactive solution being created, and exponentially growing number of sensors and devices to be utilized in full.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve the problem of creating interaction between services being programmer dependent. In order for services to interact, they need to be able to connect, communicate, and then interact. Industry has done a great job in abstracting out various components of application layers to provide connectivity and communication between two services. However, interaction logic has always been software developed. It is the single largest bottleneck in Internet of Things (IoT) solution creation, deployment, and operation. All available tools for integration are development tools. New method of creating solutions is being proposed where a solution is designed and deployed around configured interaction logic. This is different to many development tools that allow communication between services through custom service bus, messaging protocols, and APIs. Interaction logic sits on top of communication and connectivity layers. Technology involves methods and apparatus to enable interaction between all connected things, and for enabling dynamic mapping of interactions through service elements. The technology will provide easy, rapid, and cost effective proliferation of IoT solutions. Since IoT solutions are mostly interaction between devices and applications, abstracted out interaction logic allows entire solutions to be created through configuration of interaction logic.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can dramatically transform the population of people to whom automation, and its well-documented benefits, is available.  The lack of tools targeted at truly nontechnical users that still have the aspiration to be practically useful (rather than educational in nature) is a barrier to many.  The approach taken in this proposal could reduce or remove this barrier and bring simple, moving machines into many more environments.  For hobbyists, this means increased ability to self-design the logical behavior of the machines and simple devices already being created in this group.  For small to medium sized businesses, this may mean increased productivity, quality, and revenue, particularly for small-batch processes.  Further into the future, this technology can be applied to home automation where it is critical for society that all users have control over the behavior of their connected devices, particularly in such a personal space where social and cultural considerations require individual customization to design how the "smart" things around the home move.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two main objectives.  First, the computational scalability of an initial, proof-of concept prototype will be tested.  Technical hurdles for this objective include the development of a scalable code architecture and support for a larger number of so-called sensing and action primitives, which will be explained in the proposal.  Second, the ability of an untrained user to move from a contextualized use-case to specific logic design will be determined. Technical hurdles for this objective are in the domain of human factors, where a relatively complex process must be distilled to essential steps that an untrained user can relate to a familiar process in a particular environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly reducing global carbon emissions using vacuum insulating glass. Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture.  This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy.  This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap.  Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market.




    This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size.  Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects. Finally, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will conduct accelerated life testing. Independent life data, combined with a successful operating pilot line, will help secure private investment for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the potential to change the way gold mining is carried out by improving the process economics and reducing the environmental impact of mining operations. Current gold isolation methods involve the consumption of vast quantities of sodium cyanide, where cyanide is contained in large tailing dams, posing an environmental threat as exemplified by documented breaches. In the United States there are gold deposits which have not been exploited because of technology limitations and environmental concerns. The technology being developed in this project will improve the profitability of existing mines, as it can be employed with only minor changes in plant design. It will also  but will also lead to new jobs. Another opportunity is to extract gold from copper tailings dams. The proposed technology will potentially make cleanup of these sites profitable and can be applied worldwide. In the longer term, the process could be adopted in third world countries which still rely on mercury which pollutes, not only the environment, but also the food chain.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to (i) scale up the extraction of gold using both the heap and vat leach processes, (ii) optimize the crystallization of Au(III) in the presence of the natural product á-cyclodextrin, and (iii) isolate the gold. For heap leaching, it is proposed to operate at the 400-MT level, concentrate the gold salt and crystallize the gold-cyclodextrin complex. Scale-up will require designing the process to utilize existing equipment (built originally for the sodium cyanide process) and introducing new chemicals. For vat leaching, a small pilot system will be built to accept crushed ore as the feed, and the resulting gold-containing extract will be taken through the crystallization process. Optimization of the leaching agent, mass transfer, kinetics and materials consumption will be ongoing.  Regulatory approval for vat leaching, once secured, can be applied on-site globally to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of the process. This technology has the potential to significantly make existing and new mining operations more environmentally sustainable.

    proteins in algae using biomanufacturing. Some of the problems associated with
    having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost
    and feasibility. To accomplish the goal of decreasing antibiotic use, this project
    will first focus on optimizing the production process to drive the cost of producing
    colostrum proteins in algae down. Next, work will be done on developing optimal
    formulations of colostrum proteins and testing them in mice models before moving
    to larger livestock animals. Once an optimal formulation is established, trials
    will be done in pig models. In the pig models, colostrum proteins produced in
    algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting
    off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain.
    Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced
    in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals
    given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can
    drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.



    This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an improved cybersecurity posture among
    industries that rely on mission-critical computing systems that are difficult
    to patch and/or monitor. Many technical failures on these systems, including information
    breaches, equipment malfunctions, and malware infestations, stem from longstanding
    problems that go undetected.  This project develops nonintrusive measurement and
    analytics tools that give IT operators operational visibility into high-assurance
    assets, increasing confidence in their correct operation.  This project will reduce
    losses due to unscheduled maintenance across industries, improve the trustworthiness
    of embedded and semi-embedded systems such as software-based medical devices,
    and reduce the business risk of breaches and malware damage at organizations that
    rely on hard-to-manage devices. This project also advances the state of the art
    in detecting rogue software execution and other anomalies through nonintrusive
    side channels, such as observing power signals collected on a wall outlet. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to extend operational
    visibility of IT departments into mission-critical computing equipment using a
    novel combination of nonintrusive signal collection and machine learning. From
    infusion pumps to Internet routers to retail point-of-sale terminals, organizations
    rely on fixed-purpose computing systems. With this reliance comes three key risks.
    First, the effects of unscheduled interruptions to critical systems ripple outward
    to other business areas. Second, critical systems are often incompatible with
    constantly changing mainstream tools such as host-based antivirus and intrusion-detection
    systems. Third, critical systems often lag behind other systems patch levels because
    they are rarely taken out of service for patching. This project addresses these
    challenges by providing nonintrusive monitoring for critical systems in situ,
    reducing the risk of unscheduled downtime due to abnormal behavior. The company's
    monitoring hardware and software observe software execution from the vantage point
    of the power line, requiring no modifications to monitored systems and extending
    the ability of operators to understand what critical systems are doing."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing through democratization of design and simulation technologies.  Geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings. Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM education and workforce development.


    This project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications, such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a pulmonary function testing
    device for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions. Today more than 650
    million globally, nearly 10% of the world's population, suffer from lung conditions
    like Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Currently, the most
    well-established method for lung function testing is spirometry, which requires
    the patient to conduct an unnatural breathing maneuver. In addition, spirometry
    cannot detect certain lung conditions. The proposed technology will be used without
    special breathing maneuver, and will be able to differentiate more lung conditions
    than spirometer. Since the proposed device can be used while the patient is breathing
    normally, it will also cater to currently under-served patient segments, e.g.
    young children and senior citizens, for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions.
    By targeting a portable form-factor, the proposed technology will empower point-of-care
    pulmonary testing where it is currently infeasible.\n \nThe proposed project will
    develop the first handheld implementation of the well-studied principle of forced
    oscillation technique (FOT), where an acoustic pressure wave is sent via the mouth
    to a patient's lungs and reflections are used to measure lung function. Thus,
    no special breathing maneuver is required from the patient. Cognita Labs will
    adopt a modular approach for product design, and develop product-caliber advanced
    and integrated devices, that will include hardware, tablet app and EHR integration.
    The design will include all the innovations developed during Phase I to reduce
    the device size and cost while increasing its measurement accuracy. The proposed
    device will further develop and integrate a new ultra-sound based non-invasive
    sensor into the device to significantly reduce the cost of the consumable (disposable
    mouthpiece) and ultimately the cost of test. The team will also develop a new
    multi-resolution pre-screening test, with the objective to reduce bench time in

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in advanced manufacturing. This project will develop a low cost, small-footprint high-resolution nanomanufacturing platform for building optical devices that are traditionally manufactured using cleanroom microlithography. Compared with modern cleanroom approaches that require significantly more complicated and expensive facilities, this platform holds strong promise to build visible-to-infrared wavelength optical components that are both smaller and lower cost, in order to serve the fiber-optic sensor, telecommunications, and lens markets. If this platform can deliver optics components that meet specifications, demand could reach 8-figures for a single customer, thus transforming optics manufacturing across the entire spectrum of markets that use photonics: biomedical, energy, military, and consumer. If it meets the needs of the photonics sector, this platform could penetrate a much broader commercial marketplace such as information technology, nanoelectronics and personalized low-cost consumer devices. The scientific and technological understanding created by developing this platform could enable businesses to leverage low-cost US-based nanomanufacturing to address markets for advanced materials and components around the world.


    This project will commercialize an innovative nanomanufacturing platform for producing diffractive optical elements (DOEs) with potential to reduce component cost and size.  Recently fiber-optic communications has expanded beyond its traditional function of long haul or backbone communications. Reducing the size, cost and complexity of optical components could allow DOEs to further expand their reach. Ideally the functionality of these components could be built right onto the end of an optical fiber. The proposed technology could allow true fiber-to-fiber components at a cost equal to or less than currently available optical components. It could further allow for sensing capabilities of "lab on a fiber" with the lab incorporated onto the end-face of a fiber. The project will focus on scaling the nanomanufacturing capability demonstrated during Phase I for end product prototype demonstrations that incorporate the DOEs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

    The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.

    known to provide an interactive experience that has revolutionized learning for
    children. Unfortunately, while these tablet devices are intuitive to utilize and
    easy for many children, those with disabilities are largely overlooked due to
    difficulties in effecting pinch-and-swipe gestures. This project thus addresses
    a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience,
    focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while

    of this project include 1) the design of accessible math Apps usable by K-12 children
    with and without disabilities and 2) the design of apps that adapt educational
    content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics.
    Given that there are over 93 million children worldwide living with a disability
    and, in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free appropriate
    public education, there is a large potential of making both a commercial, as well
    as a societal, impact in this space.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project addresses

    The societal and environmental benefits of using pheromones are numerous: pheromones
    are considered the safest possible insecticides with respect to human food consumption
    as well as environmental impact. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
    characterized them as low risk. Our pheromone products will benefit consumers

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project could be very significant for the field of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other optoelectronics. This project is aimed at developing a solution based technology for depositing transparent conductive zinc oxide (ZnO) layers for use in LEDs and other optoelectronic devices. This ZnO deposition technology has potential to provide a lower cost and higher performance alternative to the physical vapor deposited indium tin oxide (PVD-ITO) layers that are currently used. The technology could be commercialized for LED manufacturing in only a few years. Lighting is one of the modern world's primary usages of energy and the adoption of high efficiency LED lighting has potential to significantly reduce lighting energy demand. By lowering manufacturing cost and improving performance, the technology developed in this project can help increase LED adoption and energy savings. In the longer term, this technology may also be used to lower manufacturing cost and improve performance of solar cells, impacting clean energy supply as well as demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at commercializing a technology which addresses the problem of Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) film performance and cost, in particular for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other Gallium Nitride based optoelectronics. This proposal aims to bring a solution based method for depositing Zinc Oxide (ZnO) based TCO films to the point of commercial competiveness, with the longer term goal of providing significantly lower materials, energy, and capital equipment costs than current deposition methods and TCO materials. The approach being taken in the proposal relies on well understood characterization techniques as methods of determining successfulness as well as direct feedback from device manufacturers. The small business has the support and validation of strategic partnerships with device manufacturers eager to support this development of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses the issue that while mobile devices hold great promise for education, most of the kids' apps that claim to be educational ultimately amount to little more than brain candy. Furthermore, the few apps that are based on educational research are resource-intensive to develop and therefore have limited opportunity to scale their success. This project is building an educational platform that addresses the problems of both quality and scale in this market. It is creating a content enhancement system designed specifically for creating research-based educational content that allows developers and content studios to build mobile and web apps at a fraction (10%-20%) of the cost of traditional app development. The content built using this system is automatically integrated with analytics and personalization technology that tailors the content to each child based on the child's responses. The personalization technology applies methods from psychometrics and cognitive development to ensure that the content adapts to the child and facilitates learning in an engaging way. The project will deliver a large library of context-based and personalized learning content for preK and primary grades that parents know is based on sound research, and ultimately helps increase school readiness and learning outcomes. Given the growing demand for age-appropriate mobile educational content for children, this project has the potential to generate significant returns as a commercial enterprise and, importantly, through the economic gains resulting from improvements in educational outcomes. It will also give content developers the opportunity to economically develop and deploy new content that uses personalization technology, without having to build this complex technology themselves, thereby applying this innovation at a large scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project is building a mobile game-based learning platform to onboard high quality third-party children's educational content and enhance their effectiveness through analytics and personalization. To achieve this, the project is developing two significant technical innovations: (1) a cloud-based personalization engine that powers adaptive learning in varied educational contexts and (2) a content enhancement system to efficiently and economically enrich third-party children's content (in the form of digital assets, books, or videos) with interactive learning games that are powered by the personalization logic. The personalization engine will use machine learning techniques combined with statistical methods of psychometric assessment and principles from cognitive development. It will inconspicuously measure children's interaction with the proposed platform's educational content and dynamically adjust game-play to suit each user's individual skills, interests and educational needs. The proposed model of leveraging and augmenting the efforts of many content developers is a dramatic departure from existing content development paradigms in this space. The goal of the project is to substantially increase the scale and reach of personalized, research-based learning experiences on mobile devices and ultimately maximize the potential of modern technology to deliver dynamic learning experiences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the field of radiation therapy (RT) for head & neck cancer patients. RT planning involves designing a radiation treatment regimen so that tumors are irradiated to definitive doses while minimizing irradiation to normal structures. For devising an optimal RT plan, target tumors and critical anatomic structures need to be accurately contoured on medical images. In current clinical practice, organ contour delineation is performed mostly manually due to lack of automated contouring software. This makes RT planning error prone, hampers throughput, and does not allow re-contouring to handle changes taking place during RT. Such changes can cause under dosing to tumor and overdosing to normal surrounding organs. In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have RT. Given that there are over 2,100 RT centers in the US, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing an auto-contouring software system. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved speed, throughput, and accuracy of contouring compared to current clinical practice, and improved patient outcomes and cost-savings.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses a technical hurdle related to auto-contouring in RT planning for cancer patients. Current technical challenges for auto-contouring occur since available contouring methods have been developed mostly for a specific object on images of a particular modality. This project will overcome these hurdles through a novel automatic anatomy recognition methodology which will employ anatomy models derived from patient populations by including all major objects in a body region. The models will codify the rich object anatomic relationship, and will exploit this information to automatically locate and contour objects in any given patient image. The project will have two aims. Aim 1 involves the development of the method and prototype software for contouring major head & neck organs on CT and PET/CT images. Models will be built from already existing image and contour data of 200 cancer patients. Aim 1 outcome will be prototype software technically validated to be accurate within 1 pixel boundary distance compared to ground truth and requiring 3 minutes or less per study. Aim 2 will be a preliminary clinical assessment of the software in RT planning in patients with head & neck malignancies.

    Transfer Phase I project is to commercialize technology to extract high-value
    components (e.g., omegea3 fatty acids) from algae. Omega3 fatty acids are an essential
    part of the human diet and are sourced primarily from fish oil; the fish actually
    get Omega3 from eating algae. Algae present a direct source.  However, the high
    cost of extracting the Omega3 fatty acids from the algae, which represents about
    50% of the production cost, is a significant cost hurdle that needs to be overcome.
    This project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel algae oil extraction technology
    to reduce the production cost of high-value products such as Omega 3 fatty acids
    from algae. \n\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project are
    to build an algal oil extraction system and demonstrate low-energy extraction
    configurations suitable for extracting high-value components from algae for nutraceuticals.
    The project will employ its proprietary computer models, based on Carnegie Mellon
    University research to develop a system to economically extract the oil from algae.
    This work will be accomplished through the following research objectives. First,
    specific strain(s) of algae will have their material response evaluated to assess
    their release thresholds. Secondly, models will inform and/or guide the extraction
    technology development so that the extraction process is optimized for a particular
    algae strain. Third, a low-energy extraction system will be built and tested with
    the goal of providing a system that can lead to a low cost economical way of extracting
    high value products such as Omega3 fatty acids from algae."

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a platform technology for high-throughput
    protein expression. The current standard for expressing panels of proteins involves
    extensive bioinformatics, cloning, in vivo expression, and assays. This method
    takes significant expertise in disparate fields, and weeks to months of time to
    perform successfully. Furthermore, it can be difficult to express complex proteins
    due to toxicity or purification difficulty, requiring labor-intensive diagnosis

    of hundreds of protein sequences at significant cost and time savings by providing
    a combined ex vivo computational, expression, and assay system. This allows rapid
    access to biological data, and on-demand protein sequence prototyping. The methods
    developed as part of this platform also will allow greater access to biological
    engineering for K-12 and undergraduate students, requiring little capital or prior
    biological experience. By reducing costs and time for protein engineering, and
    by working in a simple system that requires no knowledge of bioinformatics, cloning,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to develop technology to conserve scarce water resources and improve crop management practices.  Agricultural production uses a great deal of water.  In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense.  Growers have to be able to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient.  While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots.  The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste.  It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation.  Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a science-based approach to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors.  The goal is to accurately measure and then model soil properties throughout the root zone and across the field for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management through the use of 3D proprietary precision soil mapping. Integrated enological, viticultural, and statistical predictive models will relate these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume, and long-term tree/vine health. Additionally, a novel interactive spatial and temporal visual analytics environment will organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to enable stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions. By developing this optimal sensing strategy, affordable, precise soil maps and data-driven soil property models, crop composition and volume models based on environmental and historical data, and novel, understandable predictive visual analytic tools, this project will result in new crop science insights and environmental associations, as well as a much-needed precision water and crop management technology.

    Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will be, if successful, enabling the
    development of the smallest Raman spectroscopy-capable fiber probe ever developed.
    The optimization of a smaller Raman-capable probe will improve a broad range of
    clinical applications such as coronary artery plaque diagnosis during cardiac
    angiography procedures. In addition, the proposed technology represents a new
    class of 'intelligent' surgical tools based on non-invasive photonics sensing
    technology. By integrating intelligent algorithms into a variety of surgical tools,
    the team expects to improve patient safety, while reducing medical costs resulting
    from procedure complications. Finally, biophotonics technologies exist which could
    improve patient care and clinical outcomes. However, many of them are expensive
    and do not reduce overall medical costs. As medical costs are currently a national
    budget priority, the development of biophotonics technologies, that can provide
    improvements on both fronts, is a priority. It is expected that a low cost, easy
    to use, optical spectroscopy-based needle placement technology will not only improve
    the safety of a variety of surgical procedures but also reduce overall medical
    costs by decreasing the probability of expensive medical complications due to
    needle and instrument misplacement. \n\nThe proposed project will develop a miniature
    Raman spectroscopy (RS) probe which can be incorporated into epidural needles.
    This will be the smallest RS probe ever developed. Forty-five million medical
    procedures take place in the U.S. each year which rely on the blind or semi-blind
    insertion of needles into tissue. Complications include debilitating headaches,
    spinal cord injury, infection, bleeding, damage to organs, and ineffective procedures.
    The cost to the U.S. healthcare system from these complications exceeds $20 billion
    annually. Each year, 13 million epidural needles are placed and $1.2-$2.7 billion
    in immediate healthcare costs plus additional ongoing healthcare costs are spent
    for needle misplacement. From ex-vivo tissue study, we showed that RS can differentiate
    every tissue layers from skin to spinal cord. During the STTR phase I period,
    the team will develop a miniature Raman probe which can be incorporated into epidural
    needles (17-gauge Tuohy needle). A portable clinical prototype device will also
    be developed. The device will be validated by a live animal study in the MGH animal
    facility. The performance of the system will be compared to the currently used
    loss-of-resistance (LOR) epidural insertion method."

    responsible for specific odor sensations and determine how these sensors are involved
    in interaction effects between odors.  Armed with this knowledge, several things
    become possible.  The sensors associated with desirable smell sensations can be

    it possible to predict the outcome of mixing odors, facilitating the development

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency and lower the cost of treating impaired water to meet drinking water quality criteria. Membrane-based water treatment systems are at the forefront of the effort to address the current and future water crisis facing both developed and developing societies the world over. Modern membrane systems take advantage of tremendous advances in materials science and water treatment technology over the past two decades, and yet they still function very inefficiently with respect to their productivity and energy usage. The innovation that the proposed research will advance addresses this challenge by dramatically reducing membrane fouling, which lies at the root of these inefficiencies. The primary application of the innovation that will be the focus of this research is desalination of brines and seawater. Although the innovation does not remove salt from water directly, it will greatly enhance the performance of desalination by reverse osmosis processes. Given the enormous anticipated growth in the seawater desalination market in coming decades, the commercial potential for the new process is outstanding.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I project are to demonstrate and optimize the performance of an innovative pre-treatment process that removes from natural waters the contaminants that cause membrane fouling during desalination operations. The new process combines the deposition of a thin layer of heated aluminum oxide particles on a porous support surface and the passage of the raw water through those particles and the support. The particles remove a very large portion of the membrane foulants from the water, so that when it is subsequently desalinated by reverse osmosis, the reverse osmosis system can be operated at higher fluxes for longer times and at lower pressures than is currently possible. Eventually, the pre-deposited particles become saturated and must be replaced with fresh ones. The efficient removal of the particles from the support surface and the uniform and reliable application of a new layer of particles represent major challenges that will be addressed in the research.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other compounds to individual cells in a laboratory petri dish (in vitro) setting.  New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. A safe, turnkey, and scalable technology would be transformative for research and life sciences companies, and represents a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the structure and application of the nanomaterial platform dictates the resulting immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells.  Achieving this transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The protocol for using these nanomaterials is simple, and turnkey to use for life science researchers. Device costs will be reduced through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will provide greater visibility into network behavior and help identify problems before they occur in the network. Advances in cloud computing and network virtualization are changing the way networks are designed and monitored. This project will help small and medium businesses adapt to and take advantage of these advances by means of intelligent analysis of network traffic data, resulting in an optimized network and eliminating unnecessary additional capital expenditure. The resulting commercial impact is that the technology will eliminate tedious data analysis currently required of network engineers to isolate fault and performance issues, and help them achieve a more efficient, streamlined design.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on delivering a predictive network behavior analysis product that will help small and medium businesses better understand the behavior of their networks. Due to the rapid growth of new network technologies and increasing application complexity, such businesses have to constantly change and upgrade their networks. By not understanding the overall network behavior under various load conditions, they are forced to use ad-hoc methods to design and equip their networks. The objective of this project is to build a prototype that will demonstrate the proposed predictive network behavior analysis capability to potential customers. The prototype will also be used with select partners for beta testing and refining of requirements. The results will be used to further refine this prototype into a commercially viable product that can be deployed in the networks of small and medium businesses.

    This STTR Phase I project will carry out research and development on a cloud-based pluggable data analytics engine to address the educational game market?s need of real-time assessment for learning.  Educational games will become much more successful if learning from games can be well quantified so that buyers will be assured that the time spent using games is productive. However, currently game makers are not qualified or funded to provide the statistics and cognitive assessment required for such analysis. This project will thus build a prototype of commercial pluggable third-party engine that traces the growth of the learner's knowledge in real time without interference and provides customized assessment summary and feedback to educational stakeholders. The prototype will be developed and tested with games that teach data literacy in three high schools representing diverse demographic groups. The testing in a commercial environment will begin in collaboration with two successful educational game companies. The innovative use of data-intensive assessment technology will aid in currently struggling STEM education in the United States by providing streamlined and accurate information while learning occurs. This project will also help launch a new business that has potential to boost the market value of educational games and digital learning.

    This STTR Phase I project utilizes the Monte-Carlo Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (MC-BKT) algorithm. This algorithm was recently developed in-house based on techniques distilled through years of research in physics, education, and computation, and makes it possible to perform individualized knowledge tracing in real-time for the first time. In prior research, post hoc MC-BKT analysis led to identification of up to seven distinct patterns associated with knowledge growth during game segments, with 84% accuracy as compared with human judgments based on video analysis of game screens and players' discourse. This project will conduct research to test whether this assessment potential of the MC-BKT algorithm can be extended beyond initial research to players with games involving different content domains, in a greater number of classrooms with diverse demographics (involving around 600 high school students), and in real time. Based on research results, this project will build a prototype commercial product around the MC-BKT algorithm in the form of a cloud-based pluggable engine. Two popular commercial educational games as well as various games internally sourced within this project will be test-connected to the engine for real-time testing of knowledge tracing, learning problem detection, and feedback delivery to teachers, parents, game designers, and learners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable anyone with internet to access extremely powerful computing facilities to perform scientific computing. High performance computing is essential for computational prototyping in many areas of modern engineering, such as solar cells, automobiles, aerospace, and communication devices. However, significant barriers make it difficult for ordinary engineers to easily access powerful computing facilities. By leveraging the low-cost commercial cloud, the project will develop key technology that allow commercial clouds to perform extremely high performance scientific computing, thereby significantly reducing the cost and increasing the accessibility of high performance computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop technologies that overcome key challenges in using commercial clouds for high performance computing. Unlike high performance computers, commercial clouds are not designed for scientific computing. They have high latency, intermitted availability, and heterogeneously distributed resources. These features make it difficult to conduct scientific computing. This project will develop new computing methods that fully take into account the heterogeneous nature of the commercial cloud. It enables anyone to access high performance scientific computing anywhere with an easy-to-use interface. Computing is provided as on-demand service. Engineers would not need to own any high performance computers and the computing resources are virtually unlimited.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to deliver energy and electricity savings in
    the high-power lighting market, by creating an energy-efficient, high color-quality,
    and cost effective alternative to conventional light sources using laser technology
    and materials design. Commercialization of this innovation could lead to the next
    generation of energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current
    lighting technologies and drastically increasing the availability and uptake of
    energy-efficient light sources in the high-power market. As lighting is a major
    source of electricity use in the commercial and industrial markets, this would
    in turn aid in reducing global energy consumption and help to preserve our environment.
    The intellectual knowledge gained from these studies will inform future materials
    research in developing robust materials with optimal properties to advance solid-state
    lighting, as well as other energy related technologies including solar energy
    technologies. \t\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
    aims to advance research in the field of solid-state lighting towards the goal
    of ultra-efficient and smart lighting by exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission.
    In particular, the proposed innovation focuses on energy savings in the high-power
    lighting market, where high-power light emitting diode (LED) technology does not
    attain the energy efficiency seen in low-power LED technology, due to LED droop.
    The use of laser technology can simultaneously overcome the negative effects of
    droop while also leveraging the directional nature of a laser to create a focused
    light source that can be better controlled and delivered to the illumination area
    with less losses and higher overall efficiency. This project will address device
    designs using optical modeling to maximize lighting performance metrics and will
    develop materials systems to mitigate the thermal effects introduced when using
    an intense light source such as a laser or high-power LED, which can damage and
    degrade materials within the device."

    Transfer (STTR) project is to establish a bio-based manufacturing process for
    the production of the commodity chemical 4-hydroxycoumarin (4-HC) in an economical
    and renewable way. 4-HC is a direct synthetic precursor used to manufacture widely
    used oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon.
    In addition, 4-HC-derived anticoagulants are commonly used as rodenticides to
    kill rodents. Traditionally, 4-HC is commercially manufactured through chemical
    synthesis using petro-related aromatic chemicals as starting materials, which
    is neither economical nor environmentally friendly. The proposed technology to
    be developed in this project is expected to dramatically lower the production
    cost, and reduce the reliance on petro chemicals. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to create an optimal 4-HC-producing microbial strain that can be readily
    used for large-scale production. The strain is expected to have high genetic stability
    without the need for antibiotics or an inducer for production. Preliminary research
    has shown the microbial production of 4-HC from a renewable carbon source, glycerol,
    in shake flasks, which demonstrates great commercialization potential. However,
    the approach at this stage still uses host-plasmid systems that involve antibiotics
    and the inducer IPTG. This will not only increase the production cost but also
    will raise environmental concerns. Additionally, host-plasmid systems may cause
    instability in genetic properties, which is undesirable for large-scale production
    of commodity chemicals. To address these issues and achieve the goal of this STTR
    Phase I project, the following research objectives will be pursued: Integration
    of constitutively expressed 4-HC biosynthetic pathway genes into E. coli chromosomal
    DNA and its optimization; and inactivation of the E. coli endogenous enzymes responsible
    for unwanted degradation of 4-HC biosynthetic intermediates."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from the fact that increasing the reliability and robustness of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) will directly increase their adoption in real world applications. CPS technology is directly applicable to a broad range of sectors, including utility grids, smart buildings, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, etc. These sectors account for more than $32.3 trillion in economic activity, with the potential to grow to $82 trillion by 2025 - about one half of the global economy. CPSs are thus critical to the national interest in areas such as manufacturing competitiveness, defense, health care, energy production and usage, and disaster monitoring and recovery. Due to the increasing reliance on CPSs in the future, system defects could have drastic consequences. The proposed technology could significantly improve reliability of CPSs by catching defects before they result in significant loss, outages, or failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an efficient remote monitoring and diagnostic software system to detect and diagnose software defects in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs have the potential to bring about a revolution in efficiency, robustness, and safety in application domains such as smart utility grids and smart healthcare. To unleash their potential, CPSs must themselves be robust. However, despite state-of-the-art testing, software defects currently do escape into deployed CPSs. Current state-of-practice monitoring and diagnostic systems cannot improve the situation as they were not designed with the constraints of CPSs in mind, which include real-time execution, unreliable links, and resource constrained processors. The proposed technology is aimed at creating a software system capable of monitoring embedded nodes in CPSs for anomalies and providing detailed execution information to quickly diagnose the software defects responsible for any anomalies. The proposed work extends the company's extensive research in efficient collection of information for diagnosing software defects. The company expects to create a monitoring and diagnostic software system for CPSs and demonstrate its effectiveness on existing software defects in CPSs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant; transitions of care impact millions of Americans every year. The healthcare system bears substantial cost and inefficiency&#8232;on account of suboptimal care transitions and overspending. This Phase II project will support progress towards a "learning healthcare system" and will extend the capabilities of data mining and machine learning in healthcare

    The proposed project seeks to improve data mining technologies for healthcare decision support. This project will focus on the analysis of a broad variety&#8232;of data types that are common in healthcare settings. The anticipated improvements would allow frontline care staff, operational managers, and healthcare executives to assess and make stronger evidence-driven decisions regarding quality, cost, and access as patients move through the healthcare system. The enhanced data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret clinical, claims, and other types of healthcare data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop renewable and domestic chemical production and transportation fuel technologies that are cheaper, greener and more sustainable. Additionally, chemical companies are constantly looking for ways to improve business sustainability by reducing carbon footprints along with cost of manufacturing. Mixotrophic fermentation can be a step-change improvement in microbial fermentation for the production of numerous intermediate and commodity chemicals. Yields from feedstock can be increased substantially, and CO2 gas produced from the fermentation, as a waste byproduct can instead be captured and assimilated into valuable chemicals, which translates into a significant improvement in yield and productivity for any applicable commodity or intermediate chemical production process. Consequently, the commercial and environmental implications of this innovative technological approach are tremendous. Furthermore, this project could significantly enhance scientific and technological understanding of microbial physiology and metabolism during gas and carbohydrate fermentation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop and scale-up platform strains for C3 and C4 chemical production using carbon efficient pathways. The approach being developed is referred to as Anaerobic Non-Photosynthetic (ANP) mixotrophic fermentation, and process advancements will focus on bioreactor operation parameters, media formulations, and integration with product separation. By the end of this project, the project will likely have demonstrated and validated enhanced mass yield of C3 and/or C4 metabolite production at pilot-scale using ANP mixotrophic fermentation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be more effective and efficient use of unstructured data.  Limiting analysis to structured data ignores the massive amount of information in reports, memos, articles, and other written documents.  Workers require information on past work and ongoing projects, best practices, current events and competitor and customer activities.  However, companies with thousands of workers have millions of documents.  It is prohibitively expensive to index them manually so that they can be found, analyzed and acted on.  Moreover, overloaded workers do not have the time or training required to take on the task.  The problem is exacerbated by mergers and acquisitions.  In addition, over years, it is common for companies to accumulate large numbers of duplicate and out-of-date documents that workers do not take the time to rationalize and delete.  The result is inflated storage costs and reduced productivity as workers struggle to find the relevant, up-to-date information.  Inconsistent information governance also puts organizations at risk - litigation (retaining documents without legal or business value), safety (using out-of-date process safety management procedures) and operational (not leveraging best practices and lessons learned across the enterprise and beyond).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem that text documents - especially those internal to an organization - are very difficult to locate and analyze unless they are classified and tagged.  But manual classification and tagging are too expensive and inconsistent for large collections.  Large companies store many millions of documents.  And there is even more relevant information on the Web.  The objective of the proposed research to is to provide software assistants that classify documents into pre-specified categories, add tags to describe what each document is about, and the entities named in the documents (e.g., oilfields).  The assistants identify relevant documents and help people to learn of new developments by sending alerts when new documents of interest appear on the web or in the company's computers.  The primary technical result will be a suite of software assistants that companies can adopt singly or as an ensemble to help manage information sustainably.  These assistants build upon the proposed research to develop and integrate novel approaches to unsupervised machine learning, concept identification, and ontology construction.  They will enable companies to overcome major problems, including overload, finding relevant, up-to-date information, analyzing unstructured information, and identifying unneeded documents for elimination.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from it significantly strengthening the ability of network operators and security administrators to implement the correct set of rules to keep critical assets out of reach of cyber adversaries. The power grid has been said to be the most important engineering achievement of humankind. Modern civilisation depends on electricity at such an intrinsic level that we cannot imagine a world without it. In fact, disruptions of power infrastructures quickly lead to chaotic situations in which human lives are at risk. Now that power grid control centers are relying on IT infrastructures, it has become of the utmost importance to ensure the resiliency of systems and networks through methodical IT security protection, monitoring, and response. Through automated continuous verification technologies, this project has a direct impact on the capabilities of our nation to improve its resiliency. The benefit to the power industry, to computer science security, and for society at large is a technological advance to improve the security of our most important resources.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project plans to develop a constructive approach to providing cyber security. Cyber security tools are often driven by the necessity to respond to market demand without having the time and resources to develop the proper formalisms and algorithms to solve long-term issues. The innovation proposed here is uniquely positioned to change this paradigm thanks to having roots in both a fundamental academic background and an extensive collaboration with industry partners. Consequently, this project responds to critical customer needs while providing innovations in science, technology, and engineering of critical infrastructure security. The approach taken to compliance assessment has been evaluated in the field and provides a basis for new research leading to theoretically sound solutions to network security modeling, and further development of innovative and provably correct algorithms and tools for accurate and scalable cyber security assessment under real industry constraints.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to greatly enhance the capabilities of printed electronics via high performance conductive materials.  This will be accomplished by the development and commercialization of novel silver and copper ink chemistries that are used in a number of device applications ranging from display bezels and interconnects, to high performance OLED electrodes, to ink specifically developed for high speed printing and smart packaging applications.  The commercial impact of such developments will be the significant adoption and use of printed electronics material palettes across multiple consumer electronic device platforms.  This will ultimately lead to more efficient device manufacture with a simultaneous improvement in performance.  The printed electronics market is rapidly growing with progress hinging on fundamental material improvements.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate scalability of reactive silver ink chemistries, formulations for productization standards, and development of reactive copper ink chemistries.  The reactive silver ink chemistry has begun to receive significant traction with customers.  This program plans to achieve scalability of this high performance ink by novel purification of silver salts to achieve a high conductivity at large scales with industrially relevant processes.  Next the inks will need to adhere to specific productization standards.  This includes modifications of the chemistry for various printing processes ranging from low viscosity (10 cPs) up to high viscosities for high-volume printing techniques (1000 cPs and higher).  Also, modifications to the chemistry for various testing criteria such as adhesion, abrasion, and environmental tests such as humidity and heat cycling will be made.  Finally, reactive copper chemistries will be further developed.  Copper inks that can be processed thermally in the ambient environment represent both a significant challenge as well as a vast opportunity in the printed electronics market.  We have developed novel chemistries based on various low molecular weight reducing agents and short-chain surfactants that both reduce the copper quickly under thermal cycling while protecting the surface from oxidation.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered such that students get extra help when they struggle and are challenged when they can succeed on their own. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Researchers and educators have been trying to solve the "reading gap" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to make this possible.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use unique machine learning techniques to personalize reading instruction. The algorithms to personalize instruction will ensure that extra help, or scaffolding, is allocated to the students who need it, and removed when they no longer need it or when it threatens to become a crutch. This approach is different than other machine learning algorithms, which are built to minimize the overall error or maximize the overall reward. However, what is required for personalized reading instruction is different. The algorithm must learn how much to help a student not so they perform better with help, but so they perform better without it because the goal is for students to become better readers in the long term, not become reliant on scaffolding to read. The objective of the research is to fully develop and commercialize this personalized reading system and will involve data science, application development, and content authoring.

    in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, which contribute
    greatly to the nation's productivity and competitiveness. The techniques can be
    applied to many other STEM and non-STEM subjects, and for learning beyond college
    courses too.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project develops novel adaptive techniques
    for web-based learning materials, called structured student-guided adaptive (SSGA)
    techniques. In contrast to some recent adaptive commercial products, SSGA preserves
    the ability of an instructor to maintain a structured path through the material,
    which is critical for keeping students in synch with lecture/discussion sessions,
    for enabling students to study with classmates, and more. Adaptivity comes in
    several forms, including auto-generating successively-harder problems based on
    correct completion of earlier problems, with explanations and source material
    carefully integrated to ensure students learn underlying concepts. Also, the adaptivity
    is in part guided by the student, who can choose to start with simpler or harder
    problems, or can auto-generate self-quizzes based on performance, selected material,
    and more. In contrast with other products, student-guided adaptivity gives students
    appropriate control over their learning, yielding a sense of empowerment and reducing
    anxiety that can inhibit learning. The project builds the authoring platform necessary
    to support SSGA material creation, building upon a previously-developed authoring
    framework for interactive web material. The project also creates new material
    for college algebra and statistics courses, whose high attrition rates can be
    reduced by replacing traditional textbooks/homework with SSGA material."

    explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM)
    instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing
    process.  The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide
    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of
    scientific fields via its capability to non-invasively optically section samples
    of a variety of material types. \n\nThe objective of this Phase II project is
    to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive
    on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection
    of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield,
    represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation
    into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major
    outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively
    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,
    including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new
    paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    relating to the structure of matter and an aggressive approach to commercializing
    'Semiconductors of Light' in an emerging market for high density optical interconnects
    priced for datacenters. Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids
    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices
    of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential
    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important
    photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization
    methods."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow a greater number of organizations,
    businesses, and individuals to access shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging technology.
    Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has
    limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded
    in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to
    society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food
    safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface
    flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision),
    medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the
    automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving
    vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these
    fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality
    sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for
    the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing

    will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure.
    In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto
    the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment
    of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to
    smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a path to achieve the metric of less than $1 per kilolumen in Gallium Nitride (GaN) based light emitting diodes (LEDs).  This is expected to spur widespread adoption of solid state lighting which, according to the US Department of Energy, could result in electricity savings equal to the output of 44 gigawatt power plants by 2027.  The price for LEDs is slowing adoption. LEDs don't typically need to be better; they need to be cheaper. This project could directly address this adoption problem by lowering the cost of making LEDs by eliminating one of the most expensive steps in the LED production process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the technical problems in Gallium Nitride (GaN) based light emitting diodes (LEDs), namely using traditional buffer layers to grow GaN on non-GaN substrates.  Traditional approaches are typically expensive and result in crystalline defects because the buffer materials used are non-ductile crystalline structures which very effectively propagate, rather than annihilate, defects. This project develops a new substrate made with a patented crystalline metal and process that will let the manufacturers spend less time and effort to get the same or even better LED crystalline quality than they can achieve today.   Low cost growth techniques are used and to reduce defects in GaN LEDs and to improve the dollar per kilolumen cost to performance metric.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel phosphor material system that drives up to a 20% improvement in energy efficiency of phosphor-converted LEDs (pcLEDs) over current state-of-the-art phosphor material systems in nearly all pcLED applications. The market for LED phosphors in 2012 was roughly $500 million and is expected to reach $1.2 billion by 2016. The 20% improvement in the packaged LED efficiency will also trigger a cascade of tangible impacts at the end-product system level such as using fewer LEDs, increasing efficacy (lumens per watt) and mobile device battery life, reducing electronic driver complexity, reducing heat, a thinner form factor, and a far more brilliant color gamut. The anticipated results from this grant will satisfy the 2020 goals for down-converting materials laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy's 2013 Multi-Year Program Plan, bringing these efficacy and efficiency goals and standards to market four years ahead of schedule.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to further develop a novel and proprietary phosphor material system for use in phosphor-converted light-emitting diode (pcLED) applications that will improve pcLED efficacy up to 20%. In display backlighting, 20-40% of the light emitted by the state-of-the-art phosphors miss the sweet spot of the display's color filters resulting in unused light and wasted energy. Similarly, in general lighting approximately 15% of the emitted light falls outside the visible spectrum, again resulting in wasted energy. The technology developed is a phosphor material utilizing a novel chemistry that exhibits a narrow light emission spectrum to increase LED brightness and energy efficiency by 10-20% in display backlighting and up to 15% in general lighting applications. Prototype materials have been synthesized that exhibit a narrow emission peak at target wavelengths, and the next steps include optimization and characterization of the most effective compositions. The anticipated results of this project are narrow-band phosphor materials that exhibit performance and reliability characteristics commensurate with industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly lowering the cost of high precision glass molding through a low-cost carbide-bonded graphene coating. In optical industry, optical glasses have been the de facto choice. These lenses are used in cameras, projection systems and military equipment. However, cost and other considerations frequently lead to the choice of injection molded plastic lenses with their acceptable but lower image quality. The innovative carbide-bonded graphene coatings are both low cost and durable, and could allow use of precision optical glasses in places where plastic products are used today. The coatings also have the potential to spread to other markets such as advanced thermal management, next generation electronic components, and biosensors based on the unique combination of excellent mechanical, physical, optical transparency and biocompatibility properties together with tunable optoelectronic characteristics. Such products may greatly improve our daily lives in areas such as portable electronics and optics, energy saving and green manufacturing.


    This project will further advance the chemically vapor deposited carbide-bonded graphene coating process demonstrated during Phase I that involved using silicon wafers with micro/nano-patterning. With the help of our industrial partners we now intend to scale the technology to the commercial level.  The process development is targeted to developing low-cost and mass-producible high precision glass molding, micro-optics, and NIR aspheric optics for cell phones and high performance laser collimators. These activities would also enhance our understanding of carbide-bonded graphene coating technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant.  Current peptide-based drugs constitute important tools in human healthcare, and development of new peptide-based drugs represents a growing proportion of the pharmaceutical research effort.  Current peptide drugs addressing widespread diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and osteoporosis have sales above $1 billion.  These drugs must be delivered by injection.  This SBIR aims for new drugs with comparable heath benefits that can be taken in pill form, because the convenience of oral delivery, relative to injection, would rapidly capture most of the market.  The high stability engendered by our design strategy should enable drug development for diseases that currently cannot be treated.  Thus, the commercial potential of this project is high.  Orally delivered replacements for injectable drugs would have a substantial broader impact because they would enhance patient compliance.  Inadequate treatment of T2DM for example, leads to adverse health consequences that degrade productivity and quality of life for patients.  Increased compliance resulting from a general ability to deliver peptide drugs in pill form would vastly improve outcomes for patients, including the specific patients populations targeted by our current programs.


                The proposed project is motivated by fundamental questions about the way drug molecules are processed in the human body.  Drug candidates cannot address a human disease unless they reach the appropriate sites within the body and then persist in those sites.  The proposed research focuses on a particular class of bioactive compounds called "peptides."  Peptides can act in powerful and favorable ways within the body, with high specificity of action (which minimizes "side effects"), but they are subject to very rapid destruction after administration.  This weakness of peptides requires that they be injected regularly, but peptide drugs would be much more useful if they could be taken orally.  This SBIR Phase I project examines unique peptide-like molecules that are designed to retain the favorable pharmaceutical action of peptides themselves but to resist degradation mechanisms within the body that rapidly destroy peptides.  The stomach is the most destructive site for peptides, and this project aims to generate peptide-like molecules that are sufficiently robust to survive the stomach and reach the small intestine, where they can be absorbed.  Achieving these molecular design goals would have high intellectual merit in addition to advancing drug design.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an analytical assay to enable
    measurement of biological samples by mass spectrometry and fluorescence.  The
    assay will be based on a microarray platform, for applications in the areas of
    targeted quantitative proteomics, enzymatic activity assays, and combinatorial
    chemistry. Targeted quantitative proteomics measures changes in the concentration
    of a specific protein biomarker across multiple samples, such as cell lines, tissues,
    or biofluids. In the pharmaceutical industry, this method is widely used to assess
    efficiency of a drug candidate compound as well as its potential toxicity. Researchers
    are especially interested in the multiplexed approaches to quantitative proteomics
    that could provide detailed information on the state of various cellular biochemical
    networks. The significance of this project is the newly developed capability to
    rapidly separate, purify, and concentrate a large number of proteomic biomarkers
    for multiplexed quantitative analysis by mass spectrometry. This will result in
    the assay miniaturization to help lower the costs of the drug development process.
    Outside of the pharmaceutical field, the technology can be utilized in the clinical
    settings for performing minimally invasive diagnostics. It also can be extended
    to basic biology research to study a wide range of important biological interactions
    including antibody-antigen, drug candidate-drug target, enzyme-substrate, receptor-ligand,
    and others. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new analytical
    technology for life sciences termed Bead-Assisted Mass Spectrometry (BAMS). BAMS
    is a microarray platform that enables independent data acquisition by fluorescence
    and mass spectrometry. It applies the method of image cytometry to rapidly screen
    thousands of microbeads arrayed inside individual wells on a miniaturized microwell
    plate (picotiter plate). It is the first technology to incorporate high throughput
    analysis by mass spectrometry into bead-based bioassays, which in their current
    form are measured primarily on flow cytometry instruments. The dual detection
    capability is particularly important in proteomics where mass spectrometry can
    be applied to distinguish protein isoforms and proteins with different patterns
    of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. This project will
    utilize mass spectrometry imaging in combination with two- and three-dimensional
    fluorescence imaging, and will perform complementary analysis of bead arrays on
    the MALDI TOF and ESI MS platforms to achieve greater sequence coverage. This
    technology will provide researchers with far more options with respect to designing
    custom multiplex bead assays than currently possible. In addition, BAMS may be
    used to measure optically encoded beads, mass tag-encoded beads, and even non-encoded
    beads such as combinatorial peptide bead libraries."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from an enhanced capability for automated processing of free text and other structured data.  Motivation for this approach comes from neural networks and, in turn, it has applications to neural modeling and our understanding of how the brain processes information.  In the software industry, commercial innovation continues to revolve around automated processing of web pages, which plays a key role in creating many new companies.  Therefore, the ability to automate decision-making from free text is increasing in importance. A better way to represent text for use with machine learning will open new capabilities wherever the structure of sentences must be taken into account.  This has the potential to lead to new startup ventures, thereby resulting in new products and services. A successful project will result in platform technology that can provide a substantial competitive edge to companies that take advantage of it, provide new and better capabilities for consumers, and help advance the nation's lead in technological innovation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop new ways to process textual material so that computers can better learn applications related to natural language.  Applications include sentiment analysis (assigning either positive or negative views to a body of text), summarization of documents, and classification of documents using multiple labels from a fixed set of many classes.  The project will further develop new techniques to improve performance, and prototype components for transforming text and applying computerized learning methods. The new techniques represent words simultaneously with document structure using a single high-dimensional vector (for example, a list of 1,000 numbers).  The project is aimed at improving computational capabilities involving documents, web pages, and other text as well as providing new techniques that can be applied to automated translation, better computer understanding of images, and genomic information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the efficiency of identifying, mapping, and remediating water sources contaminated with chlorinated solvents.  Chlorinated solvents are used in vast quantities as solvents and degreasing agents, and in the dry cleaning industry. The necessity of monitoring chlorinated solvents in water will continue for many generations due to their widespread occurrence in water sources around the world, their toxicity, and their high stability. A significant need exists and will grow for devices that can continuously measure the concentration of chlorinated organic chemicals in water, and that can do so accurately and inexpensively. Continuous in-situ data production in the field of environmental sensing will greatly increase efficiency in all processes that require a measurement of these chemicals, having a significant impact on the costs and timelines associated with remediation of contaminated sites. This sensor will allow for continuous monitoring of possible contamination sources in the case of a contamination event. Also, it will afford easy profiling of contamination plumes in aquifers. This technology will replace the current laboratory-based measurement protocols, which are not readily adapted for in-situ, on-line, or in-the-field measurements, and cannot produce data continuously.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an optical enzymatic biosensor for continuous, quantitative monitoring of chlorinated solvent concentrations in water. Chlorinated solvent contamination of groundwater is a widespread ongoing issue around the world. The biosensing concept will be implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical biosensor tips are linked to a small electro-optical unit. Analyte detection takes place on biosensor tips that are coated with enzymes and fluorescent chemicals. The scope of the research includes two parallel strategies for obtaining highly stable detection enzymes such that long lifetime sensors are achievable, development of a system to deliver required reagents to the sensing tip, development of signal processing algorithms to enable high accuracy measurements in variable environmental conditions and speciation of chlorinated compounds within mixtures, a manufacturing study for high throughput fabrication of the sensors, and field testing of the device at multiple contamination sites. Attainment of these objectives will advance the sensing technology to a robust and readily manufactured system for chlorinated solvent monitoring with low detection limits, high accuracy, and reliability.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at reducing the impact of knee arthritis and improving the quality of life for those suffering from this debilitating condition, while simultaneously strengthening the bond between academia and industry by providing students with unique research opportunities through the development of a novel Total Knee Replacement technology.  Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending.  Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012.  The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years.  Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage.  The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants.  This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general.

    The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs.  Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while.  With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients.  The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort.  After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized.  The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.

    the ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains.
    Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical
    or fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming. Multiplex
    Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that provides a
    powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced cost. Until
    recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli, possessing key genetic
    features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed us to port MAGE to yeast,
    and the goal of this project is to increase efficiency of the system and endow
    existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo MAGE. The goal is to improve
    MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-throughput system to rapidly create
    and quantify strain variants for their capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself.
    This project will establish a system to identify and optimize the requisite genetic
    features for MAGE in yeast, in order to rapidly engineer industrial yeast strains
    for specific function."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug delivery platform
    that can improve a drug?s properties such that the drug requires less frequent

    truly enabling for peptides, a short-lived but potent class of compounds that
    in their current state are not useful as a treatment for chronic diseases. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing drugs in the $140B global biotherapeutics market.
    Use of our technology will have a significant societal impact by providing more
    efficient medicines delivered in a more patient-friendly way that could reduce
    healthcare cost and increase patient compliance. This will significantly impact
    the health, recovery and quality of life for patients with chronic diseases. Development
    of this technology will further scientific understanding of drug delivery. This
    technology will advance the field in that it has significant advantages over the
    current state-of-the-art, including the ability to allow for less frequent dosing,
    and by increasing the amount of drug available to the body. These beneficial effects
    are obtained with one simple modification that does not interfere with the function
    of the drug. \n\nThe proposed project is to develop a platform technology that
    improves the delivery of therapeutics. Peptides and many other types of drugs
    require frequent dosing because they do not last long in the body and/or require
    delivery via a needle into the vein because they are not available to the body
    when given as an injection into the skin. We are developing a way to modify peptides
    so that they can last longer in the body. As an example, current treatments for
    a cardiopulmonary rare disease only serve to alleviate symptoms. In this project,
    a novel peptide that has the potential to be a breakthrough therapeutic for this
    rare disease will be modified to improve the delivery profile. Current data suggests
    that the new therapy will be multifaceted and would treat the underlying disease.
    The objective of this study is to advance the platform technology by exploring
    other types of modifications, then test these modifications in vitro and in vivo
    to compare which modifications confer the best delivery profile. A lead compound
    will be chosen to explore efficacy in animal models, and to examine the immunogenicity
    and toxicity in rodents to generate critical early safety data. The outcome of
    SBIR Phase II will be a long-acting peptide therapeutic with strong in vivo preclinical
    efficacy data for the treatment of a rare disease that has an acceptable safety

    is compromised.  Almost all patients lose the ability to swallow as they near
    death. Approximately 10%-20% of hospice patients have severe symptoms after the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will have immediate value for the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating research and discovery of new drugs, and also increasing production efficiency and safety. The technology also is applicable in many other sectors; e.g., monitoring natural polymers, such as dissolution of gelatin used in food or pharmaceutical applications, flocculation of impurities by water purification polymers, entrapment of oil by surfactants and other agents used in combating oil spills, and more.  The quantitative kinetics of molecular weight changes during all these processes will allow deeper understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical forces that drive them. Therefore, many commercial and scientific opportunities exist for the proposed technology, yielding the potential for significant impact across multiple industries. With demonstrated feasibility on applications in protein therapeutics and early adoption by several key users, the initial market for this technology and instrumentation could expand quickly, and sales could reach $10M within several years of delivering a commercial product.  The overall market for the technology will increase in time as other application sectors are developed.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new technology for monitoring aggregation in therapeutic protein solutions, which will have wide-ranging impact in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Protein aggregation is a major problem across these sectors engaged in developing new protein pharmaceuticals. Protein aggregation can elicit immune responses against the protein itself, severely reduce bioavailability, and is a significant hurdle in the drug development pipeline. This new technology can simultaneously and quantitatively monitor the stability of many independent protein formulations for hours, days, months, or longer, all under the control of a single instrument and without any significant human intervention.  Because the technology is based on laser light scattering, it provides a rigorous means of monitoring the protein aggregation process.  It is based on fundamental laws of physics, and not on empirical or inferential means. The implementation and use of this technology could revolutionize drug discovery, formulation, and quality control dimensions and accelerate development of new drugs while making existing ones safer and more efficiently produced.  The technology can be used wherever proteins are under development for fighting diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing the world?s first ultra-high-speed variable focus optical lens that can be fully mass-produced with low manufacturing costs and high yield. The company?s proprietary tunable acoustic gradient lens technology provides versatile solutions for unmet market needs across multiple sectors, including health, security, and manufacturing. While valuable as an add-on to existing systems for imaging and processing applications, its use can be extended to other applications such as point of care medical diagnostic imaging and consumer optics/electronics.  The proposed second generation lens is expected to grow the existing market for variable focus optical lens by a factor of 5 to 10 and help transform this small business into a major original equipment components manufacturer and supplier.


    This project seeks to engineer a high volume manufacturing process that will increase product yield, reproducibility, and reliability for a novel ultra-high-speed variable focus device.  The company?s patented tunable acoustic gradient lens technology uses sound to shape light, which enables the change of focal position without any moving parts at rates that are 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing technologies.  The innovation is based on propagation of sound waves that can be controlled by the modification of the index of refraction by piezoelectric elements within the liquid lens. Phase II plan is focused on engineering and optimizing new lens designs that preserve the fundamental functionality and benefits of the first generation lens while also capturing the unique and industry leading benefits of the company's core technology. It also includes semi-automated prototype fabrication, careful system optimization, analysis and testing that pave  the path to a next generation product that can be scaled up for mass-production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the availability of relevant financial information in structured computer-usable format with high accuracy in near real time. Currently, data embedded in financial text are extracted manually by hundreds of people working for data warehouses. This manual effort takes on the order of weeks making the bulk of the data unavailable in easily computer-usable form in real time.  The benefits of this project will be focused in three areas: (i) algorithmic trading programs will be able to use all data published worldwide immediately after the data is published; (ii) financial data warehouses will be able to provide an order of magnitude larger set of data concepts (from < 200 to > 3000); (iii) there will be increased transparency in the financial markets as financial information embedded in text becomes computer-readable. In 2012 algorithmic trading was estimated to exceed $5 Trillion in value with 750 Billion shares traded, generating a profit of over $600 Million. Financial transparency is an intangible benefit that will improve financial market efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop automated methods to extract and tag relevant financial concepts from the free text of financial documents such as an annual reports, press releases and analyst reports. The extracted financial concepts will be semantically mapped (tagged) to a financial taxonomy such as the US-GAAP or IFRS for standardized analysis. There is a growing need in current financial markets for accurate and timely access to relevant financial information for supporting trading and analysis decisions.  At the end of this project, the company's technology is expected to have the capability to provide such information to analysts and decision makers in a timely fashion. The primary goals of this project will be to: (i) build an end-to-end prototype system for automatically extracting financial data from text; (ii) extend the scope of the technology to reach a broader range of real-world applications; (iii) increase accuracy; (iv) reduce the processing time for financial data extraction. The technology will employ machine learning and natural language processing techniques toward financial concept annotation, extraction and semantic tagging to achieve these goals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from its potential to transform professional networking from passive to pro-active. People-information is valuable for business professionals in sales, marketing, recruiting, fundraising, M&A and business development, to establish connections, generate leads, and generally maximize opportunities.  This project will further commercialize big data analysis techniques to quickly capture, filter, and analyze people related information from the whole Internet, and present such information to users via mobile and web services for various use cases such as networking at events, etc.  These services will enable mobile users to plan in advance whom they should meet at events, and equip them with much deeper insights regarding their prospects than are currently available, so that they can generate business more efficiently.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to further develop and commercialize the company's big data analysis and mining technology for people-information, with specific emphasis on making professional networking at events/meetings more productive and efficient. It provides a real-time, instant, "people research" capability on mobile devices to enable effective networking at business events, trade shows, conferences and private/Meetup meetings. It goes beyond existing "name-based" keyword search provided by commonly-used search engines, and is complementary to social network sites, which rely purely on subjective information provided by users themselves. Based on the company's current collaboration with large event organizers and their marketing/sales teams, the project will further extend the event mobile solution for enterprise customers by providing an organizer self-service (SaaS) platform, integrating with their CRMs, and leveraging Beacon technology to track attendee activities and interests in trade shows. In addition, it will include more advanced features to motivate individual users to use the app more frequently, including outside such events. Finally, it will build a platform with APIs to allow OEM partners to generate and use the people-information in activities such as recruiting, marketing, etc.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing the novel hardware challenges of energy and speed associated with big data applications. The electronics industry is quickly transforming from a compute-centric model to a data-centric model, where the key to success in the market place is the ability to store, manipulate and access large amounts of data in a fast and energy-efficient manner.  The existing memory technologies cannot meet these challenges. This changing landscape offers a major potential for emerging memory technologies that can successfully address these new emerging demands.  The Electric-Field-Controlled Nonvolatile Magnetic Memory technology developed under this project offers the most viable low-cost, low-power, and high-endurance solution to these new demands. Conservative estimates project a rapid growth in the emerging memory technologies market, reaching $2B in 2018. We expect that Electric-Field-Controlled Nonvolatile Magnetic Memory will be able to capture a significant part of this emerging market. More broadly, it can be used in many general computing and information processing systems, and hence it can potentially impact a major part of the $300B semiconductors industry by enabling ultra-low power green and instant-on electronic systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of prototype Electric-Field-Controlled Nonvolatile Magnetic Memory chips and arrays.  This memory technology uses a fundamentally new way to write information into the nonvolatile memory bits, providing major advantages in terms of power dissipation, cost, density, and scalability. This project will result in chip prototypes, providing significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency, density, and scalability when compared to alternative existing or emerging memory technologies. They also provide virtually unlimited endurance.  Circuit design for memory product development will also be performed, as well as modeling in support of circuit development and device optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to wherever headphones are used to listen to sound. The first commercial markets targeted by the technology being developed are gaming, virtual reality and consumer entertainment. These are areas in which the US has strong market and technology leads. By the end of the project, the company intends to have developed software that can be licensed to major players in these areas, reaching tens of millions of users. Beyond these markets, there are many applications for spatial audio in human-computer interfaces to deliver spatial information along with the intended semantic message. Several niche markets also exist, such as data presentation/exploration via sonification and specifically designed auditory interfaces for vision-impaired users. Overall it is expected that the proposed R&D work will advance the state of the art in science and technology and will be of substantial value to society as a whole due to high usability, fidelity, naturalness, and portability of the developed spatial audio solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop highly realistic and computationally efficient software for synthesis of personalized spatial audio, for applications that include virtual reality, gaming, and prostheses for the blind. Current algorithms are either perceptually unsatisfactory or have very high computational load. Approximate modeling of sound propagation, reverberation, and diffusion, along with tradeoffs between complexity and quality, will be explored using perceptual distortion metrics combined with the skills of professional listeners. The software will be optimized for use on mobile, console and embedded platforms. Additionally, a method to personalize the software to individual listeners, which was previously developed and tested in laboratory conditions, will be further refined and ruggedized for use in realistic environments. The expected outcomes will include a high-quality and efficient audio rendering library, a portable personalization apparatus, and several demonstrations that highlight the capabilities of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to accelerate the pace of microbe development for the biomanufacture of valuable proteins, advanced enzymes for industry, or therapeutic medicines. DNA cloning is an everyday practice in the course of both industrial- and university-based research. Cloning technology has remained largely unchanged for the last 20 years.  As a consequence, researchers consume a significant amount of time and money designing and constructing DNA, rather than on designing and conducting experiments. Over the past few years, standardized experimental DNA construction methods have been developed that lend themselves well to automation and rapid assembly of DNA. Process automation is progressing from luxury to necessity, as target applications demand the fabrication of large combinatorial DNA libraries in the search for better antibodies, faster enzymes, and more productive microbial strains. The proposed technology will allow rapid forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA. The commercial availability of this technology will provide a low cost alternative to current methods.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a bioCAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing) technology that enables rapid DNA assembly for synthetic biology. Wedding recent advances in DNA assembly methods, and the software algorithms used to design those DNA assemblies, the proposed research will result in a platform technology for facilitating an optimized combination of direct synthesis and DNA assembly to make large combinatorial libraries.   After the construction of the DNA libraries, screening for constructs with the desired activity remains a major scale-limiting bottleneck, both in terms of cost and time.  The proposed technology will allow rapid prototyping and characterization of forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA, proteins, or whole cells.  The goal is to commercialize an easy-to-use platform for assembling complex constructs onto vector backbones, transfecting them into host microbes, and doing a rapid assessment of product yield.  Results are captured, saved, and returned to a design database after data cleansing and analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor industry by improving the quality of A/MS design verification, improving first pass design success and reducing time-to-market. Today, current analog verification methods and tools often fail to catch design mistakes, especially due to unforeseen interactions across chip subsystems, and these mistakes are a frequent cause of costly delays in bringing products to market even on chips where analog is only a small portion of the overall design ? a $63 billion market. The costs and lost profit potential related to multiple design versions can quickly run to millions of dollars and easily dwarfs the cost of providing designers access to the appropriate design tools. Using two different market analyses, the first using a digital verification market analogy and the second considering worldwide new (not slight derivatives) designs in just the AMS IC market, leads to an estimation of total available market for new analog verification solutions of $300 million annual revenue. Further extending the verification solutions with analytics and collaboration tools can potentially increase the market by a further 50% to $450 million annual revenue. Understanding A/MS verification coverage is a key component of this opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes a verification coverage system for analog/mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuit development. Verification of today?s complex integrated circuits and systems is widely acknowledged as a critical challenge to improving design productivity. Part of the verification challenge revolves around understanding what portion of the operating space has been examined; i.e., ?covered?. Today well-accepted formal and simulation-based techniques exist to capture and measure test coverage for digital integrated circuits, but there is no corresponding commercial capability for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Analog designers frequently spend too much time analyzing and over-testing system behavior for a small set of well understood usage scenarios while leaving significant portions of the state-space completely untested. The design exploration problem for A/MS circuits presents a critical challenge for implementing such systems due to the inherently large design space associated with these types of circuits. Key objectives for the project include productizing and extending key components demonstrated in the Phase 1 prototype. This project will deliver a commercial product to provide A/MS verification coverage data that is actionable and facilitates collaboration between design and verification teams. The resulting product will have scalability and performance to handle large complex designs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the delivery of a custom-made nipple made from a patient's own cells for women who have had a mastectomy due to breast cancer.   In the US about 300,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually and nearly 40% will undergo mastectomies, full removal of the breast.  A third of them will opt for breast reconstruction, most of whom will desire a nipple.  Patients with loss of the nipple areola complex (NAC) from cancer treatments continue to experience psychological distress long after breast mound reconstruction has taken place, yet currently available options for nipple reconstruction are vulnerable to an unpredictable degree of loss of nipple projection, symmetry, color and possible need for reoperation.  The technology can be evolved to treat other unmet needs in reconstruction and the cosmetic surgery field. The technology in this project can contribute to the scientific knowledge fundamental to the fields of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine. The results of this research will help the field move towards larger, clinically relevant tissues and potentially the creation of whole organs.

    This project will investigate, develop tools and techniques, and select best formulation for the ultimate delivery of a graft that has been tissue engineered to address the lack of reconstructive solutions for women that have undergone mastectomies and desire nipple reconstruction.   The research aims of the Phase II project will demonstrate further  viability of the scientific concepts proposed, such as impact of vascularization on volume retention, and develop tools/techniques for engineering shaped adipose tissue constructs (relevant to nipple projection).  The project will test and select best formulation for adipose constructs as measured by in vivo volume retention, host reaction and vascular infusion.   The research proposes to further optimize size and projection parameters and develop methods to assess and characterize incoming materials to reproducibly fabricate constructs with the correct size and desired volume retention.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the research and development required to produce a Skills- and Assessments-based Learning Environment for high school biology classes.  This project will create a modular software system that is underpinned by a unique data analysis platform.  Using 3D interactive video gaming technology, each module will place a key science concept in the context of solving a real world problem.  Students will be assessed at each stage of the problem-solving process, and their performance is exported to an online analysis platform in real time.  In doing so, the teacher is given an instant visual representation that helps the teacher identify pain points for each student.  By addressing these pain points, the students become more adept at each step of the problem solving process and, as they complete more modules, they are able to hone their overall problem solving skills. This project support NSF's mission by training students in the skills necessary to pursue a career in science, technology, or any problem solving profession. This project will build a grow-able and sustainable software company that will create lasting jobs for artists, software developers, and scientists.

    This project centers on the ethos that successful scientists solve real-world problems, and students need to experience this first hand.  The aim of Phase II is to complete the technical objectives required to bring produce a Skills- and Assessments-based Learning Environment to market, which require: A) the development and implementation of software modules that address teacher-identified curricular "pain points", and B) the development and refinement of the analysis system based on customer feedback. This project presents a refined approach that can be applied to any science discipline, namely: problem solving is a skill, skills can be honed through practice, and the key to solving science problems is mastery of the scientific practices that comprise the scientific method. The system will guide students as they 1) acquire the requisite knowledge; 2) collect data; 3) analyze and interpret data; 4) form and test a hypothesis; 5) refine the hypothesis, if needed, according to the data; and 6) communicate their findings. The analysis system will enable teachers to assess student achievement at each of these steps in real time, thereby allowing them to identify and address areas that are problematic for individual students.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is as part of a broader plan to develop, validate, and market this new surgical device across a broad spectrum of surgeries involving internal incisions (a total of 10 million procedures annually in the U.S. alone). This technology has particular value in the rapidly-growing minimally-invasive surgery market, in which internal closure is made difficult by the small size of superficial incisions. These markets represent more than 6 million surgeries per year in the U.S., creating a domestic market potential of more than $2.5 billion for the platform of closure devices under development. Initially, the system directly addresses a specific unmet clinical need: reducing both the technical demands of internal closure during minimally-invasive hysterectomy and the significant complications associated with the use of sutures in this procedure. There were approximately 420,000 of these surgeries performed in the U.S. in 2013, representing more two-thirds of all U.S. hysterectomies. This fraction of hysterectomies performed in this manner is continuing to grow, and will represent a total annual addressable domestic market size at peak sales of $200 MM ($600 MM globally).

    The proposed project develops a novel surgical closure system for closing internal incisions in endoscopy. Our initial application is in laparoscopic (minimally-invasive) hysterectomy. Sutures are typically used to close internal incisions in laparoscopic surgery. Throwing loops and tying knots are among the most difficult parts of laparoscopic procedures; these difficulties have slowed the adoption of laparoscopic hysterectomy. In Phase II, the Technical Objectives are (1) to refine the closure system to meet the requirements of a minimum viable product; (2) to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the system in a large animal model of laparoscopic hysterectomy; and (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the system in laparoscopic hysterectomy in a cadaveric model. These objectives are designed to complete the evaluation of the performance of this novel closure system against product requirements identified by the surgical community and utilized in the design process.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it enabling (i) faster and more
    productive computer software and (ii) a significant improvement in the ability
    to counter cyber threats. Many enterprises, such as financial firms and online
    retailers, operate software platforms that are central to their business. Even
    a few minutes of reduced platform performance can lead to financial losses in
    the millions of dollars. The first project outcome will enable enterprises to
    automatically detect and rapidly resolve such performance problems, leading to
    more efficient information systems, more satisfied consumers and more profitable
    companies. The second outcome will boost the defenses of our nation's computers
    against cyber-attacks. President Obama recently cited cyber threats as one of
    our most serious economic and national security challenges. Losses from theft
    of intellectual property are estimated to cost American companies around $250
    Billion annually. The company's malware analysis technology will detect some of
    the most advanced attacks that defeat today's defenses, leading to safer consumer
    and enterprise data, and reducing financial losses. Overall the company's technology
    enhances the technical understanding of binary code, an important class of software
    employed in a range of enterprise software and most modern cyber-attacks. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a software tool
    called a binary rewriter that can understand and modify binary code. Although
    software applications are developed in human-readable programming languages, a
    large fraction is translated to binary code to be executed on hardware. Binary
    code is difficult to understand and modify. In addition, modern sophisticated
    techniques such as packing - employed by malware writers - further complicate
    this task. The intellectual merit of the project is based around the development
    of a novel binary rewriting mechanism that fulfills critical requirements that
    cannot be simultaneously achieved by any existing rewriting tool. The new rewriting
    mechanism will be able to reliably rewrite every binary program, including programs
    containing sophisticated techniques such as packing, without compromising the
    critical requirement for low run-time and memory overhead. It will also provide
    a novel mechanism for (i) monitoring the performance of enterprise applications
    as part of an advanced performance monitoring framework; and (ii) detecting, and
    therefore providing a means to stop, infection from evasive malware, a sophisticated
    class of malware that deliberately hides its malicious behavior."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    enable unprecedented freedom for architectural photovoltaic adoption by maintaining
    the aesthetics of existing building materials and the quality of natural indoor
    lighting. This unique approach offers to achieve levelized photovoltaic energy
    costs of 0.05-0.1 $/kWhr by (1) producing 10-40% of DC building electricity at
    the point of utilization, eliminating the need for DC-AC-DC power electronics,
    (2) simultaneously reducing building cooling demands 10-30% through rejection
    of infrared solar heat, increasing the effective PV efficiency by over 5% (absolute),
    and (3) piggybacking on the materials, installation, framing, customer acquisition,
    and maintenance of the existing building envelope, reducing non-module costs by
    over 50%. This project will also result in a core knowledge from which future
    generations of transparent photovoltaic devices and materials will be designed.
    Visibly transparent photovoltaics are also amenable to seamless energy harvesting
    within non-window surfaces such as electronic displays and mobile electronic accessories,
    enhancing the functionality of those products without impacting aesthetics or
    functionality. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops
    a transformational visibly transparent photovoltaic device. Building-integrated
    photovoltaics are a promising energy pathway to capturing large areas of solar
    energy and increasing US building efficiency at the point of utilization. However,
    the widespread adoption of such technologies is severely hampered by the cost
    and aesthetics associated with mounting traditional photovoltaic cells on siding
    and windows. In this project, these challenges are overcome by exploiting the
    excitonic character of molecular and organic semiconductors that lead to oscillator
    bunching to produce photovoltaic architectures with selective absorption, i.e.
    exhibiting visible minima and ultra-violet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) maxima,
    uniquely distinct from the band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors.
    By using excitonic molecular semiconductors with structured absorption in the
    UV/NIR these devices are simultaneously optimized for high power conversion efficiency,
    visible light transmission, and color rendering index."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an environment resistant inertial measurement unit (eIMU) for commercial/industrial applications. This eIMU is a miniaturized navigation device that will enable enhanced GPS navigation down to centimeter accuracy and will replace GPS when it is not available or reliable. The eIMU will enable navigation directly to specific items in malls, grocery stores or department stores. It will also enable reliable navigation for police or fire fighters inside buildings in emergency situations. This navigation chip would enable a wide range of precision manufacturing and assembly robots. It would also enable the navigation of autonomous vehicles that can be used by police and homeland security in addition to commercial applications, such as real estate and smart agriculture. The eIMU could also be used to help map mines and to aid in oil exploration. In the medical industry, the eIMU could be used for surgical robots and wheel chairs. Scientific applications include miniaturize micro- and nano- satellites; and autonomous vehicles for underwater exploration. Overall, the eIMU targets making precision navigation small and affordable enough to be used throughout our society for enhanced industrial, security, scientific and personal applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new environment resistant inertial measurement unit (eIMUs). Inertial measurement units (IMUs) consist of accelerometers and gyroscopes which work together for navigation and orientation measurements. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial (motion) sensors are now used for a wide range of consumer applications, but can?t be used for precision navigation because of their extreme environmental sensitivity. In particular, the measurement (bias) stability of these sensors is extremely sensitive to temperature, humidity and stress?making it very challenging to us them for precision navigation and machine control. The proposed eIMU will address this by building a micromachined physics package around the sensitive MEMS sensors in order to actively control their environment independent of environmental factors. The technical challenges include: i) developing a process for reliably assembling the IMU dies in to the physics package; ii) optimizing the physics package for temperature stability and in order to prevent it from introducing any noise to the IMU and; iii) optimizing software algorithms for reducing the power required for environmentally stabilizing the IMU. This packaging technology will also be generic and applicable to other sensor systems and technologies.

    the precision of microtechnology with low-power microfluidics to realize a fully-implantable
    micropump specifically tailored for drug delivery applications in rodents. Currently,
    drug administration is predominantly conducted by manual handling and needle injection
    which is labor-intensive, induces stress and other ?white-coat? effects and is
    limited to simple drug release profiles. There is a need for advanced drug administration
    capability in animals that enables new complex dosing profiles, provides automation
    for chronic studies, and improves scientific validity. Technical challenges include
    the development of a low-power inductively-powered pump actuator, ten-fold pump
    miniaturization and wireless control of a large number of implanted pumps. The
    research objectives are (1) to optimize pump performance and usability (2) to
    extend cage size compatibility and connectivity (3) to optimize software usability
    (4) to optimize system design and establish quality assurance processes for scale-up
    and (5) to conduct an in-vivo validation study.  Successful demonstration of the
    remotely-controlled implantable infusion pump system will enable new dosing schemes,
    provide precise temporally controlled dosing for more reproducible results from
    acute and chronic studies, and enable new approaches to drug therapy that would
    not otherwise be possible. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this
    project lies in uniquely improving scientific outcomes and facilitating the drug
    development/discovery process. Currently, only one in 10,000 drug candidates successfully
    attain FDA approval with a significant number of candidates failing or discarded
    due to inadequate drug administration.  Rapid and accurate evaluation of efficacy,
    safety and toxicity early in the drug development process is improved through
    the fully automated, wirelessly-controlled drug dosing technology supported by
    this Phase II project.  This project targets the international laboratory animal
    market estimated at $3.4B in 2012. Animal models are employed throughout the drug
    development pipeline and in particular, rodents are critical to drug candidate
    target validation, screening, and optimization. Included in this effort are several
    significant first-to-market capabilities such as chronic dosing capability in
    freely-moving, tether-free mice and high-throughput evaluation of multiple new
    drugs through automation. The controlled delivery of agents, including emerging
    biologics, siRNA, peptides, and small molecules, is an important capability in
    a multitude of clinical and preclinical research applications including neuroscience,
    pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology. More importantly, this project will
    enable drug studies that to be performed in a manner that will facilitate and
    enhance the translation of candidate therapies from animal to human."

    prototype, characterize, and verify performance merits and the commercial viability
    of an Adaptive Dual-Fuel (ADF) Injector. Diesel engines are 30~40% more efficient
    than port-injected gasoline, spark-ignited engines. Gasoline and E85 fuels are
    among the most widely available fuels, but are mostly used on spark-ignition gasoline
    engines with much lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines. The key innovation
    of the ADF injector enables direct-injections of both gasoline/E85 and diesel
    fuel selectively on-demand from a single injector. The ADF injector can enable
    advanced combustion modes that have demonstrated simultaneous reduction of NOx
    and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and improved engine efficiency through advanced
    low temperature combustion. The advanced combustion mode enabled by the ADF injector
    can improve the thermal efficiency of gasoline/E85 engines by approximately 30~40%
    by using gasoline and/or E85 fuels in a compression ignition combustion mode.
    The adaptive dual-fuel injector also provides flexibility for enabling engines
    to run on either pure diesel, gasoline-diesel, or E85-diesel dual fuels. The Phase
    II work includes prototyping, spray visualization imaging and laser based measurements,
    computational optimization, and single-cylinder engine combustion testing to demonstrate
    the commercial viability of the proposed ADF injector. \n\n\nThe broader/commercial
    impacts of this project pertain to significant benefits for energy security and
    environmental protection. The potential customers include engine OEMs and auto
    makers. This project will significantly benefit US consumers through fuel cost
    saving, enable low cost methods to meet the new CAFE standards, and benefit the
    US economy by expanding the ?green? manufacturing base. The dual fuel injector,
    developed and analyzed in this work, provides new capabilities, which can enable
    transformative combustion methods for ultra-high efficiency, clean combustion.
    The industry-university collaborative engineering research directly support graduate
    student research and will train and educate the workforce of the future, providing
    them with the knowledge and skills needed to address the challenges of energy
    utilization. The research and development efforts, which focus on a critical problem
    of global importance, will be widely disseminated to engine designers, OEMs, and
    researchers, while the next generation of engineers is being trained."

    positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative
    disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. PET is now a key diagnostic and
    management tool in oncology, and compounds labeled with [18F]-fluoride provide
    optimal signal to noise ratios and resolution in medical imaging applications.
    Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination
    technology that allows [18F]-labeled medicines to be prepared efficiently from
    cyclotron-produced [18F]-fluoride. Under this Phase II research project GFP will
    apply its new technology to produce the imaging agent 6- [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA),
    a compound useful in diagnosing Parkinson's disease and in cancer imaging, that
    is not currently readily available because of the difficulty in its production.
    GFP will scale-up and manufacture pharmaceutical grade ALPDOPA (GFP's precursor
    to FDOPA) under pharmaceutical cGMP conditions, and offer this material for research
    studies and for clinical imaging. GFP will develop an FDA drug master file and
    will provide technical and regulatory assistance to cyclotron pharmacy customers
    adopting GFP's technology for commercial production of FDOPA. In addition to helping

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses a critical national need for more expansive and hands-on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education by developing a mechatronic and robotics construction kit for teaching and learning engineering design synthesis. The research objective is to develop a teaching tool to interest young learners in engineering design, encourage and engage them in engineering practices specifically, creating appealing technology through exploring STEM topics that meets or exceeds national standards. The goal is to engage young people regardless of prior technical experience or STEM exposure in designing mechatronics and robotics systems, and through this to gain interest, experience, and confidence in engineering design synthesis. The work comprises developing construction kit hardware, a software environment for children to program their mechatronic constructions, and materials for using the kit to teach and learn STEM topics and engineering design. As the hardware advances, the project will develop software and learning resources that scaffold the construction kit with educational materials. It aims to support teachers and other educators incorporating the mechatronics kit into classroom and out-of-school learning, addressing national STEM standards while advancing research on how children learn complex design concepts and how educators can best support this progression.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in engendering in young learners innovation, design, and creative problem solving among the most important skills for tomorrow's workforce. These skills are addressed within STEM disciplines, however, too often the use of technology in education is limited to skill based computer operations, and engineering is neglected altogether. The teaching and learning tool and its ensemble of software and learning resources truly integrates every letter in the STEM acronym, while inviting students who have no background in robotics, engineering, design, technology, or computer programming to begin creating immediately. This leverages their creativity as motivation to continue learning in these fields. Precisely because kit removes the need for advanced fabrication skills or programming knowledge, this kit and its accompanying activities will promote broader inclusion of students who may have traditionally felt intimidated from more complex STEM engagement. As more students succeed with the kit and its ensemble of learning activities, this enhances a future workforce, an informed citizenry, as well as supporting teachers and educators to explore what all students can achieve when given motivating and confidence building STEM activities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project anticipates bringing forth a disruptive mouth guard technology that answers the urgent need for better dental protection.  In the US alone, every year more than 1 million dental injuries occur, resulting in medical costs of roughly $500 million.  The proposed technology will involve novel manufacturing methods to incorporate energy absorbing solid/liquid suspensions into novel thermo-polymer mouth guard designs to achieve enhanced impact energy absorption capacity.  The specific technical objectives are to optimize the energy absorbing capacity of the formulated solid/liquid suspensions, develop the necessary manufacturing technology for incorporating such solid/liquid suspensions monolithically into the thermo- polymer, and finally to characterize the mouth guards by subjection to stress testing (chemical, physical, and thermal).  This energy absorbing mouth guard will deliver on-demand, tunable energy absorption capacity that can be specifically tailored to provide superior dental protection to users in several venues including medical, sports, industrial and military.  This R&D effort will produce the first ever mouth guard made with material that adaptively absorbs impact energy, a stark technological contrast to the conventional (passive) mouth guard.   This new technology will also contribute basic understanding to the emerging field of nanorheology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant.  In just the mouth guard arena, realizing this technologically advanced mouth guard will likely bring a novel product into the dental protection market. Then there is the untapped market to provide much needed dental protection for patients undergoing medical procedures. Yearly about 150,000 dental injuries occur just during endotracheal intubations, required when undergoing general anesthesia.  Further, the new energy absorbing fluid-thermopolymer material technology  to emerge  could  serve  as  the  technical  groundwork  for  a  plethora  of  energy dampening products.  In addition, the research stands to seed a new body of knowledge, small- scale (millimeter) leveraged use of energy absorptive fluids.   Realizing the technical objectives of this Phase II R&D effort will help foster local economic growth when the company?s new manufacturing facility opens for the fabrication of mouth guards based on this technology.  A large number of jobs will be created requiring very diverse technical skills, and the company is committed to fill these jobs with a diverse work force.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop robust and effective imaging techniques for assessment of atherosclerotic
    disease severity for prognostic and longitudinal use. In the United States alone,
    approximately 5 million patients suffer pre-stroke symptoms of which 795,000 go
    on to a stroke annually. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes, while
    the remainder are recurrent strokes. Despite these statistics, there is no effective
    test to tell who will or will not suffer acute events or to measure whether medical
    therapies are effective at reducing the risk. In this project, multivariate quantitative
    descriptors are developed using data from controlled outcome studies on a specialized
    model to discover and validate prognostic signatures that, in composite, perform
    well in both cross-sectional prognostic and longitudinal applications with high
    predictive value.  Phase I results are extended to support histologically verifiable
    tissue types, expanding the functional and performance attributes of the product
    with a tie to localized ground truth maps made possible with co-registration of
    histology with MRI. The plan is to iteratively validate the developed capability
    under commercially accepted design controls.  \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project will be the development of effective means for computer-aided
    prognostics using quantitative imaging phenotypes. Physicians face a complex and
    heterogeneous series of clinical manifestations of disease. Because disease arises
    through a complex interaction of multiple molecular signals and pathways often
    confounding the eventual effect, tools and approaches are needed to identify key
    pathways that reflect the underlying pathological processes. Functional imaging
    modalities have recently emerged for characterization of these disease processes
    and to obtain a better mechanistic understanding of the underlying biologic processes
    to distinguish more aggressive from less aggressive disease phenotypes. Computer-aided
    prognosis (CAP) of disease is a new and exciting complement to the field of computer-aided
    diagnosis (CAD). Since CAP approaches distinguish between different subtypes of
    a particular disease (as opposed to CAD schemes trying to distinguish diseased
    from benign processes), there is a need for more sophisticated image analysis,
    computer vision, and machine learning methods to identify subtle disease signatures
    that can separate unstable from stable disease.  The chosen application in this
    project is a use case that has the potential to radically increase the power of
    applications to support clinicians in pursuit of personalized medicine."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will determine the technical feasibility and the commercial value proposition for high temperature, highly processable fiber optic coatings across a range of markets to include fiber lasers, fibers for oil and gas, avionics fiber, and medical fiber. Tetramer will perform research to modify the structure of polymer coatings to provide enhanced performance which will extend the capabilities of current fiber optics. Coatings developed will advance our understanding of structure property relationships and establish new boundaries for the polymer system. During this program, Tetramer will synthesize new monomers and polymers and evaluate their properties for use as fiber coatings. At the end of this program, Tetramer anticipates it will have developed 3 new types of polymers with a set of performance characteristics which are not available from any one single material today. New fiber coatings will be developed which are capable of operating at temperatures above 300 deg C, having greater processability, and for laser applications, having lower refractive indices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will impact society in many ways due to the various markets in which the coatings can have a meaningful impact on the optical fiber performance. Fiber optic lasers are quickly becoming the preferred method for laser fabrication. By enabling fiber lasers to operate at higher temperatures, fiber lasers will immediately see increased output powers and longer service lifetimes. With applications in industrial metal working (welding, cutting, and engraving/marking), micromachining, and medical devices, doubling power output via improved coatings will have a major impact across many industries. Higher temperature fiber coatings will improve down-hole drilling and the overall efficiency of oil drilling operations through better temperature monitoring in deep wells. This has the potential to lower prices of oil and increase oil production. Additionally, these fibers can aid in geothermal well monitoring which would provide a green source of energy. The coatings under development have the potential to generate increased revenue and profit throughout the value chain through increased performance of products and enhanced market sizes through enhanced capabilities. Tetramer will also use this Phase II program to train undergraduate and graduate level students from nearby Clemson University

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of electrostatic surface haptics as a means of providing tactile feedback for touchscreens.  In electrostatic surface haptics, a user's finger(s) are selectively pulled down to a glass surface by an electrostatic potential, just as a capacitor's plates are attracted to one another.  The enhanced normal force leads to an enhanced frictional force when the fingers are moved across the surface.  By modulating the electrostatic force in response to finger position and time, a great variety of compelling haptic percepts can be created.  In previous work, low voltage techniques, thin hard high dielectric coatings, a way of avoiding the necessity of grounding the user, patterns of transparent conductor that allow different fingers to experience different sensations, and some of the software controls, were developed.  In Phase II, methods of finger position sensing that are fully compatible with haptic actuation will be developed.  The new methods also offer the possibility of discriminating multi-touch fingers according to same or opposite hand, or the fingers of a second person on the same touchscreen.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from enriched communication with touchscreen devices. Already touchscreens are of immense commercial importance.  The worldwide market for touchscreen modules grew three-fold from 2009 to 2011 with smartphones, tablet computers, and automotive display applications leading the charge.  Consumers have been attracted to the versatility of touchscreens as input devices, yet the absence of haptic feedback has limited accessibility for low-vision populations, exacerbated safety concerns in applications such as driving, and prohibited the aesthetics of touch from being fully developed.  Surface haptics technology has the potential to address all of these weaknesses.  It can be used to make user interface elements operable by touch alone, to create new interaction metaphors, and to enhance the overall user experience.  By addressing known and latent needs in the marketplace, surface haptics will foster new industrial growth.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project goal is to produce GaSb photovoltaic devices of multicell (MIM) construction for TPV use.   Current devices use single cell.  MIM devices have significant advantages over single cell in efficiency and cost. A MIM device is composed of many sub-cells physically isolated on the same substrate.  This proportionally increases output voltage and decreases output current resulting in lower internal power loss.   To date there have been no publications describing MIM Ge or GaSb  MIM devices.  The Phase I Program demonstrated that high lifetime GaSb can be epitaxially grown on semi insulating GaAs and an IR&D program demonstrated that 50 subcell MIM devices can be fabricated from epitaxial germanium on semi insulating GaAs.  Combining these elements will produce an ideal device. Although the Ge MiM is suitable for TPV a GaSb MIM would give a three to tenfold improvement in performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to economically & efficiently recover waste heat as electricity.  57% of all power generated in the US is rejected as waste heat, however, to date there have been no successful attempts to recover this heat as electricity as opposed to steam for heating purposes. MTPV is developing a thermophotovoltaic solution to address this problem and is a pioneer in the use of near-field evanescent coupling to dramatically increase the power density obtainable from a heat source at a given temperature.   MTPV has published a clear demonstration of this phenomenon and is engaged in commercializing its use.    Silicon emitter chips designed to transfer energy from a heat source in such a manner as to facilitate the formation of a sub-micron gap are currently being produced in a foundry as well as both single cell and MIM Ge devices.  The unique housing that is required to contain these chips and allow insertion into an 1100 degree C furnace is designed/ fabricated at MTPV?s facility where power generation tests are conducted.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will use waste methane gas (biogas) as a feedstock to produce pellets of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a valuable polymer that is converted into a variety of high margin or high volume, eco-friendly plastic products such as childrens toys, electronic casings, water bottles, and food packaging containers. The current plastics market is dominated by petroleum-derived, non-biodegradable, energy-intensive plastics, which often persist in the environment upon disposal. Alternative plastics are derived from rapidly renewable biological resources (biobased) and consumed by microbes when no longer needed (biodegradable). Unfortunately, these alternative plastics are often costly to produce and  their  manufacturing  process  requires  significant  amounts  of  energy.  Mango Materials has a novel, patented, energy-efficient method to produce a biodegradable, biobased polymer at a price competitive with petrochemical-based polymers.  Phase II involves scaling the Mango Materials process to produce samples for customers to test while addressing associated challenges. Key goals are to optimize the production process and to verify that customers can process the product on existing manufacturing equipment. Key results include a more optimized process, customer validation of samples, a thorough understanding of polymer characteristics, and an updated cost and yield comparison.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will ultimately be the widespread production of low-cost bioplastics from waste biogas and the eventual displacement of petroleum-based  plastics.  Bioplastics  have  the  potential  to  capture  an  increasing fraction of the plastics market, thereby giving consumers the choice to purchase affordable, environmentally friendly, bioplastic-based products. When products made from Mango Materials bioplastic are disposed in modern wastewater treatment plants or landfills, they biodegrade anaerobically (without oxygen) to methane. This methane can be cycled back and re-enter the process as feedstock to produce more PHA.  Thus, the life cycle may be closed, creating a cradle to cradle system. This use of biogas will provide a strong economic incentive for facilities to capture their methane, rather than releasing or flaring it, which will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and reduce corresponding impacts on global warming. The innovation will enhance scientific understanding by studying the production of bioplastic from waste biogas and by characterizing the microbial species responsible for this conversion. This project represents one of the first times that waste biogas will be used commercially as a feedstock for bacteria to produce a valuable product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address new regulations being enacted in
    the shipping industry requiring Sulfur Oxides (SOx) reduction from engine emissions. Many commercial
    scrubber systems effectively remove SOx from engine emissions, yet none are designed to remove polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). EnSolve?s approach is to develop a combined biological and mechanical
    system that can remove PAHs from the scrubber system waste water. The results of the Phase I study confirmed
    the biomechanical approach was effective in reducing PAHs at rates exceeding 99%.

    The broader impacts of this research will be to provide the maritime industry with a cost effective, reliable, and environmentally conscious treatment system for removing toxic substances from the world?s oceans. Ships will be required to either install scrubbing equipment or they will need to switch to more costly low sulfur fuels. A switch to low sulfur fuel would increase current fuel costs by over 88%. A commercial ship owner could realize annual savings of $2 million per vessel in fuel costs using a scrubber system compared with purchasing low sulfur fuel. An estimated 35,000 ships will be impacted by these regulations, yielding a market opportunity for the proposed scrubber water treatment system exceeding $5 billion. Other technologies under development utilize pure physical separation methods that transfer the contaminants from the scrubber water to another medium (i.e., filters) for disposal. Conversely, the proposed biological approach is a regenerative process that would significantly reduce landfill disposal, consumable, labor, and liability costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help establish a commercially viable method for mass production of high-efficiency heat exchangers for the rapid advancement of thermoelectric solar cells and waste heat management. The advancement to be made in this project will help harvest an enormous amount of solar energy and heat energy from the environment. Thermal energy from natural (solar, geothermal etc.) as well as from man-made thermal sources is a continuously available, and currently underutilized resource with the potential to become an important pillar of renewable energy. The solar thermoelectric devices require minimal maintenance and are suitable for deployment in remote regions. The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the performance of solar thermoelectric generators. Besides harnessing solar energy, thermoelectric devices can also be used for waste heat recovery from automobile exhaust and industries using high-temperature furnaces to enhance fuel efficiency and generate electricity for automotive operations. Our estimated outcome can enhance the fuel efficiency of automobile engines by 15-20 %with around $67 billion annual reductions in gasoline expenses and around 570 billion pound reduction in annual carbon emission.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a disruptive technology to improve the efficiency of thermoelectric devices. Currently, the efficiency of thermoelectric devices is much lower than their theoretical values due to the lack of ideal heat exchanger materials for both hot and cold ends. The research goal is to enhance current module efficiency by more than 90%. The project includes testing and validation of the heat exchanger into thermoelectric generation modules for solar electricity generation and waste heat management from thermal sources at different temperatures, as well as developing methods for mass production of heat exchanger materials. The size of the treated surfaces can be well controlled, making it possible to fabricate microscale solar thermal devices for infrared sensors and night vision cameras.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

    Research (SBIR) project is to engineer brewer's yeast for a more consistent, cost-effective,
    and sustainable brewing process. The flowers of hop plants provide both bitterness
    and \"hoppy\" flavor to beer. Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive
    crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it expensive and difficult
    to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.  The goal is to engineer brewer's
    yeast to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor
    to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil.
    Over the last two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for
    beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries
    to source (total domestic hop sales have tripled over the last 10 years due to
    heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources:
    ~100 trillion liters of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops.
    Reducing the reliance of the brewing industry on hops would significantly increase
    the sustainability of the brewing process by decreasing water usage, also leading
    to the commercial benefits of decreased brewing costs and greater consistency
    of beer flavor.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer the biosynthesis
    of hop-derived monoterpenes in brewer's yeast to meet the following industrial
    performance requirements: 1) Normal propagation and fermentation characteristics,
    2) precise and robust production of monoterpenes at scale, and 3) the absence
    of off-flavors. The proposed research sets out to test whether the expression
    of 5 key biosynthesis pathway enzymes can be expressed in a way that each of these
    performance requirements is met in a single strain.  Recently developed synthetic
    biology tools will be used to create hundreds of DNA constructs, each containing
    a different combination of promoters driving expression of the 4 corresponding
    genes (designs).  Incorporating genetically stable DNA constructs into brewer's
    yeast is complicated by their polyploid genome. To overcome this difficulty, preliminary
    work was conducted to develop a Cas9-mediated integration strategy, which leverages
    a colorometric assay to assist with the challenge of identifying stable pathway
    transformants.  Strains will be constructed and evaluated in two subsequent rounds.
    \ In the first round, a diverse set of designs will be explored, and in a second
    round, strains will be constructed based on the designs that most closely meet
    with performance requirements and avoid production of potential off-flavors."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a new disruptive approach to enable the digital transformation of US industrial infrastructure through extreme low latency, highly reliable and secure wireless networks. The proposal aligns closely with U.S. government programs such as Manufacturing USA and the National Robotics Initiative. The World Economic Forum reported recently that manufacturing has been immensely important to the prosperity of nations. This has never been more true than right now as countries compete to make huge investments in the digital transformation process of their manufacturing firms. The innovation provides significant advancement that is expected to boost U.S. worker productivity, advance wireless innovation and increase cost savings and business agility. The Industrial Internet of Things drives new investment in automated factories, industrial digital networks and integration with real-time edge computing. Data expansion at the edge of today's networks are new challenges for industrial firms that seek to deploy flexible and economically viable digital infrastructure. The company provides an innovative solution that enables wireless edge computing. Instead of expensive and inflexible wired networks, this new technology unlocks the full potential of wireless sensor networks for automation and control systems. 

    The proposed project will demonstrate the company's concept of ultra-secure, highly reliable, time-sensitive/synchronized wireless protocol for Industrial IoT markets. The novel system design is a general purpose, extremely low latency, wireless communications link that supports real-time connection to industrial devices. The company's technology operates chaos-based spread spectrum communications links, functional chaos-based IIoT sub-nets with anticipated scalability of a plurality of sub-nets operating within unlicensed bands. Enabling an extreme precision time synchronization is critical to industrial systems and network applications in time-sensitive edge computing networks. To date, standard access technologies such as Ethernet are not deterministic and clock synchronization protocols are fundamentally limited by the characteristics of packet switching or efficient access to reliable clocks. In particular, legacy network's jitter, packet buffering and scheduling in switches and network stack overheads add non-deterministic variances to the round trip time, which must be accurately measured to synchronize clocks. This proposal is for a wireless-based synchronization technology that uses more granular timing mechanisms to achieve nanosecond precision. The company introduces a clock synchronization protocol that uses wireless chaotic waveforms that connects to network devices for decentralized clock synchronization. This eliminates the need for wires and non-deterministic elements in clock synchronization protocols.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable doctors to maximize the diagnostic information extracted from costly Pediatric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Annually, approximately 3.5 million brain MRI scans are performed with average prices with interpretation from $500 - $2,000. Even though the scans are expensive to acquire and interpret, doctors generally only use visual inspection of the images to diagnose abnormalities. The proposed software will be relatively cheap compared to the overall cost of an MRI and is expected to let doctors make accurate measurements of key structures in the brain. This is important because developmental and other diseases can cause small volume and surface area changes that cannot be easily seen by the human eye. By detecting these changes early, doctors should be able to treat the disease at early stages, potentially leading to better quality of life and financial savings. The proposed tool is also expected to enable doctors to better track treatment outcomes, by measuring the effect a drug or treatment has on particular structures in the brain. Ultimately, it is expected that the proposed technology will improve quality of care as well as reduce healthcare costs.

    The proposed project leverages current advances in computational technology such as machine learning and computer vision to automatically measure volume, surface area and shapes in critical parts of the brain in children. These measurements are then compared to a large database of children over the ages of 0-12 years to determine if they have deviated from normal. Although MRIs have been increasing adopted as the diagnostic tool of choice for childhood brain disorders due to the lack of radiation, there has yet to be a tool that allows doctors to accurately measure changes in a child's brain from MRI scans. Because, in children, the brain is rapidly changing as she/he grows, it is difficult to determine visually whether the changes are due to normal development or disease. By measuring the brain accurately and comparing it to a large database already collected by the proposing team, it is expected that a pediatric doctor will be able to determine whether a child's brain has deviated from normal. It could also allow physicians to better select treatments and monitor the patient response to a specific therapy.

    using the proposed technology will make these materials more affordable. In addition,
    the proposed technology can be readily extended to purify other biooligomers including
    peptides and oligosaccharides. This extension will have a high impact in areas
    such as biomedical research. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to method
    for synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide purification based on the \"catching by polymerization\"
    concept for the purification of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Currently, most
    synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides are purified using chromatography methods, which
    rely on the rate of speed difference at which product and impurities travel in
    a solid matrix when eluted with solvents for separation. Drawbacks include expensive
    instrumentation, intensive labor, use of large volumes of harmful solvents and
    inability to purify long sequences. This method is expensive to scale up and unsuitable
    for parallel purification. This project aims to commercialize the catching full-length
    sequence by polymerization oligodeoxynucleotide purification technology to solve
    these problems. The method works by selectively tagging a polymerizable group
    to the oligodeoxynucleotide product, polymerizing it into an insoluble polymer,
    washing away all impurities and then cleaving the product from the polymer. Because
    the principle on which the product is separated from impurities is drastically
    different from that of chromatography methods, the proposed technique has many
    advantages, which include no need for expensive instrumentation, simple-to-use,
    low waste to product ratio, and suitability for purification of long sequences.
    Additionally, the new technique is readily scalable for large-scale purification,
    and can be easily adopted for parallel purification."

    This SBIR Phase I project uses artificial intelligence techniques to identify the ways that undergraduate students in scientific courses explicate problems, describe procedures, make claims, provide evidence, offer qualifications, and draw conclusions. With emphasis on forms of scientific reasoning, this new use of artificial intelligence, to identify language patterns associated with scientific reasoning, will allow students to improve their written laboratory reports before they are submitted, therefore freeing instructors to devote precious instructional time to preparing students for roles as practicing scientists. As the U.S. continues to experience rapid diversity growth, this focus on helping students through innovative uses of technology holds the potential to expand science education by cultivating student ability through autonomous writing and revision. Because artificial intelligence techniques are intended to expand capabilities, the techniques being used, available 24/4 on the web, will have the direct impact of growing our technical and scientific workforce, thus expanding the many dynamic pathways to STEM occupations. As the NSF observed in 2015 in its report Revisiting the STEM Workforce, these jobs are extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness and are essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness. An investment in such a technology is thus an investment in national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and workforce diversity.

    NSF SBIR support will be used to design and launch artificial intelligence techniques based on Deep Artificial Neural Network (DANN) as driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the latest advances in AI algorithms. Because NLP and LSA techniques are presently used solely to identify grammatical and organizational patterns, the application of DANN is high risk in making a leap from identifying patterns of language use to capturing patterns of scientific reasoning. Trained on a proprietary corpus of 100,000 lab reports scored and annotated by instructors and students using a single rubric, the AI application will identify logic structures of scientific reasoning in student laboratory reports. Once methodically identified, categorized according to ability level, and validated by STEM instructors, digital instruction will be used to help students improve their scientific reasoning processes. With the singular goal of structuring student success through asynchronous machine learning, this innovation holds the promise to figure meaningfully in discussions of national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and diversity as related to STEM education.

    This STTR Phase I project will enable the rapid prototyping and manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) components with 3D printing, and thereby reduce component cost, weight, and turnaround time. The global RF components market is expected to reach $17.54 billion by 2022, but fabrication techniques for commercial RF components have seen little innovation. Conventional RF manufacturing techniques, such machining and photolithography, are accurate and reliable, but they are also expensive, time-consuming and produce unnecessary waste. 3D printing enables fast and accurate manufacturing of custom components, as well as the creation of extremely complex geometries at low-cost for improved component performance. 3D printing can also enable users to design components to fit the design space available, removing the necessity of designing technology around commercially available parts, a critical feature in space and weight-sensitive aerospace applications. However, the materials available to 3D printing are mostly limited to non-conducting polymers. By creating a highly conductive 3D printing material, and testing the properties of RF components made with this filament, this project will make it possible to rapidly prototype and produce custom RF components, thereby accelerating research and improving the competitiveness of RF component manufacturing in the U.S.

    This STTR proposal will create a highly conductive (>2×10^5 S m-1) polymer filament that can be used with low-cost fused deposition modeling 3D printers to create a variety of high-value RF components. The filament will be engineered to print reliably, and retain its conductivity and mechanical integrity to temperatures of ~150 °C. To achieve these goals, the proposed work will determine the relationship between conductivity, the loading of conductive filler, the shape of the conductive filler, the filament mechanical properties, and the viscosity of the filament at printing temperatures. New methods will be developed to prevent oxidation of the conductive filler at elevated temperatures. A novel conductive filler will be developed to achieve these performance specifications at low cost. Concurrent with these material development efforts, novel RF components will be designed, simulated, and printed in order to build a comprehensive database with detailed designs and printing parameters for producing the RF components with a low failure rate. By the end of this project, users will be able to design, predict, and reliably print RF components with conductive filament on low-cost 3D printers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an engineered nonmodel yeast platform for
    the economical and sustainable production of natural aroma compounds. High quality
    aroma compounds have a variety of applications, ranging from flavor and fragrance
    to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. With the strong consumer demand for more natural
    alternatives to chemically synthesized ingredients in both food and personal care
    items, the production of these ingredients by fermentation will add a renewable
    source to the supply chain and will reduce demand on botanical sources. This work
    will advance methodologies and knowledge for creating novel microbial cell factories
    via 13C-metabolite tracing, metabolic flux analysis, fermentation optimization,
    and kinetic modeling. The lessons from this research will offer general guidelines
    for overcoming biosynthesis hurdles and optimizing bioprocess operations, and
    will facilitate the development of transferable technologies for inexpensive production
    of diverse natural products that are broadly used for human health and wellness.
    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural
    aroma compounds. Because plants carry aroma compounds in extremely low amounts,
    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these
    challenges, this project will develop a novel fermentation process for production
    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.
    Ultimately, this environmentally friendly process would provide a new, reliable
    and natural manufacture scheme to meet the growing demand of consumers for healthier

    This SBIR Phase I project will research the feasibility of applying virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in manufacturing and material testing training programs to increase academic achievement, accelerate progress toward degree and foster more effective use of expensive lab-equipment.  According to 2014 statistics, in the United States, less than 40% of students entering college in STEM fields finish with a STEM degree. And even for those who finish, a majority (over 60% ) take several years longer than the nominal time of 4 years. Providing students with VR and AR enabled personalized manufacturing labs is a promising way to increase students' engagement and better prepare them for future careers as well as broaden students' outlook on innovation. As described in the recent US council report on competitiveness, advanced manufacturing has the largest multiplier effect on jobs. In order for the US to gain competitiveness in this sector, there is a pressing need for a trained workforce that is able to develop new materials testing protocols and manufacturing processes. This SBIR project aims to develop technologies that enable the education sector to leverage VR and AR to accelerate training. Proposed software will be evaluated through pilot testing. Technology and insights resulting from this project may find applications in other domains such as life sciences.


    Key technical innovations in this proposed research include the development of a novel high-fidelity modular virtual object model, customized task models based on evidence centered design, and methods to flexibly combine object models with task models to rapidly develop activities suitable for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. These innovations may significantly reduce the content creation cost and potentially dissolve the boundary between classroom education and hands-on training, providing an effective and seamless educational experience. In the long term, these innovations may also be applied broadly to training in other domains. The overarching goal of this SBIR project is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system for content creation and learning analytics and apply them to create innovative content for use in manufacturing courses. The proposed system and content will be evaluated via pilot testing with engineering students to collect rich datasets comprising videos, sensor time series data and simulation-event logs. Data analysis will seek evidence for changes in both students outcomes (changes in content knowledge, engagement, attitude towards engineering, self-efficacy towards learning engineering, usability of the product) and instructor outcomes (attitudes about the usefulness of the product).

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of the Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a bioreactor that may be used for production and expansion of cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery.  While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of an instrument to address the
    scaling and regulatory challenges of quality control that increase cost and impede
    large scale deployment of cellular therapies to a wide patient base. Cellular
    therapies taking advantage of engineered human cells have shown incredible potential
    as \"living drugs\" that achieve personalized therapies for cancer patients. Recent
    improvements in these therapies have shown their efficacy in targeting and killing
    specific types of leukemias. In light of these successes, more and more research
    and clinical trials are being proposed to improve current efficacy in treating
    blood cancers and adapting these therapies to other cancers types. While showing
    promise in the fight against cancer, there is growing concern over the manufacturability
    of clinical doses, especially when scaling up to meet global demands. Additionally,
    the speed at which these therapies are being developed is causing regulatory agencies
    to lag behind in terms of quality control and release criteria. Both of these
    issues will need to be addressed as cellular therapies continue to improve and
    increase in demand. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated
    quality control instrument for the manufacture of cellular therapies, which centers
    around a disruptive new technology called ratcheting cytometry. Currently, quality
    control of therapeutic cell batches remains difficult to standardize and scale
    given the plethora of standalone tools needed to adequately characterize each
    batch. This modular approach has high capital cost, high recurring maintenance
    costs, and requires skilled technicians. Ideally, the capabilities of these standalone
    tools can be combined into one automated system to provide standardized metrics
    for cellular therapy quality without user variability. Leveraging well-established
    immunomagnetic cell labeling techniques, ratcheting cytometry is able combine
    the capabilities of quality control tools by individually measuring magnetic content
    and gating based on surface expression. Leveraging these advantages, the goal
    is to demonstrate feasibility for an integrated instrument to quantify cell number,
    viability, surface expression, and cytokine secretion of therapeutic cell batches

    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a new class of biorational chemicals (based on chemical communicants from plant symbiotic fungi) that provide season-long improvements in plant productivity including enhanced root growth, resistance to a variety of stresses including drought, and increases in plant yield. This system will be developed for delivery as a seed treatment or as an augmented fertilizer. The novel products will be sold to famers through already-developed delivery systems primarily through agricultural distributors and seed companies. They are expected to increase plant root development, crop yields and tolerance/resistance to drought and other adverse conditions. The products can be used equally well by large and sophisticated farmers and seed companies, including those using advanced plant genetic traits, but is also adaptable to smaller growers since the input costs to users will be less than competitive technologies for especially coping with adverse environmental stresses. These tools and advances will assist is overcoming the adverse effects of climate change and provide technologies to maximize scarce water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to formulate the active chemicals to provide user-friendly products for delivery in suitable agricultural systems including seed treatments and augmented fertilizers, and to evaluate prototype products on their advantages in the greenhouse, pilot scale and field trial systems. The field trials will be conducted under conditions of drought stress and will permit measurement of water use efficiency of conventional and advanced drought tolerant corn hybrids in the presence and absence of the new products, and will provide a means to determine the mechanism by which the active chemicals provide improvements in plant performance. This third goal is essential since the chemicals as applied are present only during seed germination, but enhance plant performance throughout the season. The formulations are based on novel systems that will sequester volatile active chemicals but release them only when seeds are germinating. The plant performance characteristics that will be measured include enhanced root development throughout the season, enhanced yield parameters under water limiting conditions, and measure water use efficiency.

    have not been possible to date. As such, only 10% of all human odorant sensors
    have been linked to their single odor. The preliminary data show that the in vivo
    expression of human odor sensors in mouse olfactory sensory neurons are functional.
    The objective of this project is to show that in vivo expressed odor sensors,
    when removed from their biological model system, maintain their functionality
    (i.e., ex vivo). A secondary objective is to demonstrate that several types of
    odor receptors, each with an accepted odor profile, will respond as predicted
    when analyzed ex vivo using a biochemical assay measuring direct activation of
    odorant receptors. Successful assay development will allow the generation of a

    platform to address exosome characterization requirements through two development
    aims: 1) Develop, validate, and demonstrate a disposable microfluidic device that
    will allow customers to configure the assay for characterization of specific populations
    of exosomes, and 2) enable robust detection and identification of the smallest
    populations of low-index exosome nanoparticles, down to 50 nm, allowing complete
    exosome sizing in a high-throughput platform. The completion of these objectives
    will result in a product to be sold to researchers working on nanoparticle-based

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a low cost educational platform which provides students a gateway to understanding and writing software code in modern real-world programming languages. The research addresses a pressing need in the K-12 setting to engage both teachers and students in Coding as a Literacy. Current approaches to teaching computer science and programming principles in K-12 often fail to bridge the gap between block-based graphical representations and text-based programming languages. Strong growth in Maker Spaces within school classrooms and libraries has led to a proliferation of Maker-oriented products in the K-12 setting, but teachers and students alike struggle to understand the software coding required to make meaningful use of them. The project embraces the Maker spirit with an expandable robotics platform that provides fertile ground for lesson development, paired with software that enables step-by-step execution of the student's code over a wireless connection. The commercialization of this technology will augment the effectiveness of STEM initiatives underway in the nation?s schools, keep students engaged in more advanced computer programming as they transition into middle and high school levels, boost the enrollment in technical disciplines at the University level, and ultimately increase the technology-related global competitiveness of the national workforce.

    The goal of this project is to overcome current limitations in microcontroller-based software development, with specific focus on the enablement of interactive debugging capabilities without the use of "target monitor" hardware external to the microcontroller itself. The project includes both software and hardware development efforts, as the research is directed at enabling a highly integrated system through the use of state-of-the-art silicon technology designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The advent of these System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits brings the potential for a radically lower cost, IP-connected educational technology platform. The hardware aspect of the project will include development of a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly leveraging a wireless SoC to provide a Wi-Fi connected robotic computing platform with an expandable circuit interface and a complement of built-in peripherals designed for educational applications. The software will provide a web-based user interface seamlessly integrated with the hardware platform to enable a level of interactive coding not previously seen on a wireless SoC. The commercialized product resulting from this project will leverage this interactive debugging user experience to teach real-world programming language development skills.

    and long-term product stability, as well as preventing downstream problems, such
    as inconsistent bioavailability and/or dosing. The NanoContTM platform is expected

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a simple to use "smoke alarm" for water appliances coupled with a level of insight into water consumption and failures that has never existed before. What was once a reliance on water meter data for the sum of all appliances is now a detailed understanding for each individual water fixture. This unprecedented access to water usage data at an individual appliance level will provide the opportunity for increased data analytics research, predictive analytics for failure modes and maintenance scheduling, and better understanding of human consumption habits to identify and solve problems that allow organizations to meet aggressive sustainability goals.  Only recently has there been an ability for hospitals to aggregate their medical information to aid research efforts to treat and cure chronic diseases and illnesses.  Mobius is looking to do the same for any building owner for water, as the growing concern to continued, reasonable costing fresh water becomes even greater.

    The proposed project will provide the opportunity for the development of an IoT Smart Water Management System (SWMS). It will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to both identify leaks so they can be corrected before wasting precious water and energy, and provide predictive analytics for actionable insights. This will significantly improve water appliance maintenance and prevent costly water damage to properties. Further, at a macro level, it provides municipality level insight for maintenance and crisis management. The vision is to easily install these SWMS devices into any existing water fixture. It will take less than 60 seconds to install and connect to the Internet. The design goal is to be cost-effective from the start. The SWMS provides an affordable and easy way to adopt data driven decision making into current operations. The critical objectives set forth in this proposal are centered on achieving a simple "smoke alarm" like warning of a fault coupled with a robust analytics platform.  Finally, these will be designed as highly durable IoT devices that require little or no maintenance.

    circuits. The flow combines simulation, analysis, synthesis, place-and-route,
    and test with similar efficiency as standard commercial flows. This research aims
    to limit the additional testing overhead of the converted design and the performance
    impact of interfacing with traditional circuits to within 10% of synchronous counterparts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make the solar industry even more sustainable by reducting long term potential environmental impact. With the rapid deployment of solar modules, recycling of end-of-life modules will become a necessity in 15 years. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that end-of-life modules will appear in large quantities by the early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most end-of-life modules end up in landfills. More importantly, this project will develop a technology to enable a profitable recycling business without any government support, financial and/or legislative. IRENA predicts a new industry worth $15 billion by 2050 from recycling 78 million tonnes of modules. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The focus of the project is to recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, tin, aluminum, and glass. It will be demonstrated that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon and the recovered metals are over 99% pure. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The chemicals for recycling will be carefully chosen so their wastes neutralize each other for a minimal environmental impact.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is many-fold. The novel photosensor technology developed within this project will enable a new generation of ultrasensitive experiments in the broad field of astroparticle physics?designed and constructed on previously impossible scales This technology is advantageous as detectors of ultrahigh energy cosmic radiation, neutrinos, dark matter and more. In addition, our technology addresses societal needs, including advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. In medical application, the same core technology can enable the production of cost-effective ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners (patent pending) for preventive, virtually harmless (low-dose) cancer screening of the symptom-free population (a currently non-existent service). For nuclear security application, this technology can enable widespread and cost-effective detection of illicit fissionable and radioactive materials (also a currently non-existent possibility). In general, this project can lead to the creation of a highly profitable and multi-faceted hi-tech industry.

    The proposed project will meet the needs of our lead customer/partner, an international collaboration aiming at the detection of cosmic neutrino radiation at the South Pole site with unprecedentedly high sensitivity. Such sensitivity will be achieved in a volume of 10km^3 of ice, instrumented with 2500 m deep chains of detectors, and only a detector concept and cost-effective hi-tech production method like ours can reach that goal. However, harsh conditions at the experimental site require specific modifications to the core design of our invention. Pairs of modified photosensors will need to be packed into each detector unit, which will be electrically grounded on its surface, so the standard high-voltage connection must be swapped with the ground-potential. Consequently, the photodiode will be moved from the middle to the periphery, and specially designed light pipes will bring the light to them. At the same time, we will design a high-voltage power supply that will be integrated within the narrow spacing between the two photosensors. Additionally, this assembly must operate at -70 oC. Therefore, we will produce modified photosensors, design and produce all the additional components and interfaces, test the detectors under near-realistic conditions, and share them with our customer/partner for further evaluation and feedback.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,

    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about

    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable
    continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained sensor-enabled
    devices. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory
    processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited
    to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing
    resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability
    and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or
    remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market
    for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and
    wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage
    environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed
    technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including
    medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness
    devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly
    deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to
    revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application
    domains. \n\t\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to
    research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking
    neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human
    brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the
    spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability
    to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight,
    etc.), to interpret the outside world, and to recognize the current context. A
    key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural
    algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across
    multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from
    very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will
    provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory
    information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense
    modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses
    on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using
    a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project
    centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic
    surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even
    the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of
    medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally
    invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in
    healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric
    medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from
    these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing
    submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size
    and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling.
    The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture
    arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor
    imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion
    free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications
    in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \n\nThe miniaturization
    of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain
    point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited,
    yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops
    a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers.
    As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can
    remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements
    to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark
    contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold
    scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing
    these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based
    devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication,
    and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the
    system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array
    for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images
    to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the
    prototype."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor
    design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally
    friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers,
    tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market
    is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns
    over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments.
    Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses
    many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals
    underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel
    generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an
    affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with
    the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor
    design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging
    field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables
    energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces
    of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. \n\n\n\nThis project will transform
    our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated
    as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the
    challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed
    using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize
    the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding
    edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine
    life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible
    power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed
    above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational
    fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance
    improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with
    multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible
    power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will
    also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The
    performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing
    locally and with The University of Washington."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


    This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to overcome limitations that prevent effective treatment of wound infections. There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


    The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

    the potential to increase the accessibility of learning materials, promote readiness
    and knowledge of employment options, and improve students' attitudes toward full-time
    employment. Unfortunately, the lack of an accessible, coherent career planning
    system in the United States has left many high school students unprepared to meet
    the rigorous demands associated with being college and career ready. This project
    will teach critical life, social, and academic skills related to a career in Science,
    Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This project is designed to enhance
    student learning, reduce school costs, and increase the efficacy of transition
    plans, which are mandated for every student with a disability under Federal law.
    The game aligns with Common Core Standards and the Universal Design for Learning
    framework. While this project will be designed for students with disabilities,
    it is assumed the highly accessible career preparation software will also meet
    a critical need for other students at risk of learning failure or students without
    disabilities. \n\nThis project is a critical component of a comprehensive product
    line that will provide adolescents with virtual career training. During the project,
    participants will experience mini-games related to their daily living skills,
    a \"day in the life\" of a person in a STEM career, and social skills that those
    allow individuals to interpret different cultures in a STEM environment. A virtual
    mentor coaches the student to make choices that will lead to career advancement
    and explains the hierarchy of jobs within the chosen career. The virtual mentor
    also provides financial advice throughout the daily living games, modeling exemplary
    fiscal management and reinforcing decisions that have a high likelihood of leading
    to financial stability. The project team will build, test, analyze, and revise
    the mini-games and then compile the revisions into a beta version of the game.
    Initial friends and family tests of the alpha builds will include qualitative
    evaluation using observations and interviews. This will be followed with beta
    testing in public schools using a mixed methods design. Beta testing will include
    students with and without disabilities in grades six through nine, special education
    and general education teachers, counselors and parents."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying smart computer vision applications. This improvement will simplify the deployment of smart vision applications in automotive, sports and entertainment, consumer, robotics and machine vision, medical, and security/surveillance domains. Through a unique and energy-efficient hardware computation platform, automated hardware design for machine learning applications, and efficient implementation libraries, this project will improve both the feature set and efficiency of smart vision applications across a wide range of end-use cases. With the rapid growth in smart vision applications, this project will be a key enabling technology to support high-performance, energy efficient and scalable solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) applications promise to produce billions in revenue and trillions in global economic impact through improved efficiency, safety, energy, and labor costs. Wide deployment of customized computing in IoT applications will lead to substantial energy savings, and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, and a more sustainable growth model for deployment of intelligent sensor systems with thousands or millions of sensor nodes analyzing large volumes of input data.
    The proposed project focuses on the design of high performance, energy-efficient IoT computer vision platforms, design tools, and implementation libraries. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive design and implementation platform to meet performance and energy goals; however, there are two main challenges to their adoption (1) small FPGAs are cost-effective but insufficient to replace the efficient, low-cost ASICs for computation-demanding applications; large FPGAs can fulfill all computation demands, but are too expensive to meet IoT price points, and (2) design and development for FPGAs is challenging and require hardware design expertise. This project?s innovation targets these challenges. First, our proposed platform will combine a media ASIC for efficient video processing with a small cost-effective FPGA for custom machine learning. Second, our proposed domain specific high level synthesis will generate efficient machine learning accelerators for standard machine learning infrastructures quickly, limiting required hardware design expertise while out-performing general purpose design techniques. This project will leverage background expertise in hardware design, design tools, and machine learning to develop and demonstrate the advantages of hybrid computation platforms for smart vision applications in terms of performance, energy consumption, cost and physical size.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in addressing blood clots in the pulmonary
    artery. Venous thrombosis, comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
    embolism (PE), occurs with an incidence of approximately 1 per 1000 annually in
    adult populations. Estimates suggest that 60k -100k Americans die of DVT/PE (also
    called venous thromboembolism). The current treatments are high risk to the patients
    and very expensive to the health care systems. Current treatment methods involve
    the use of systemic or catheter-directed thrombolytic medications to break down
    the clot and restore blood flow. The use of these medications carries the risk
    of bleeding in different parts of the body which can lead to death. Open-heart
    surgery is another treatment method, but the high risk of this critical surgery
    requires highly skilled physicians and advanced equipment that may not be available
    in most hospitals. The proposed device is simple and intuitive and allows the
    physicians to complete the treatment and restore the blood flow in less than 30
    minutes of the patient arrival while other treatment methods take several hours
    for mechanical thrombectomy and several days for catheter-delivered thrombolysis.
    This will significantly reduce the total procedure cost by reducing the length
    of stay in the intensive care unit from the average of 2-3 days to only a few
    hours. \n\nThe proposed project advances the current of the art of Nitinol medical
    device design, fabrication, and evaluation. The proposed clot removal device targets
    pulmonary embolism which is a common disease and may lead to death. The proposing
    team has established the technologies and know-how to produce the core Nitinol
    components of device. These include a simulation-based design optimization methodology,
    which has been used for the design of the main blood clot capturing funnels from
    Nitinol. The team has established innovative non-conventional fabrication and
    post-processing heat treatment procedures. Based on the anatomy and functionality
    of the circulation system an innovative test set up has been fabricated that can
    replicate the blockage of arteries. To this end, human blood clots are created
    and inserted in the test apparatus for a later retrieval. One of the main innovations
    is a Nitinol structure designed to allow for a 7-fold increase in the diameter
    of the blood capturing device when deployed: when deployed these Nitinol elements
    can expand from 2mm to 14mm in diameter, without any balloon or other external
    force. This innovative functionality has never been achieved before and is essential
    for the atraumatic functionality of the proposed device. This has been achieved
    by developing a mathematical method to systematically calculate the shape and
    size of laser cutting feature on a tube of Nitinol. With proper heat treatment,
    this tube can be formed to produce the two capturing baskets. The team has also
    used additive manufacturing and advanced computer simulation to create a test
    setup for in vitro testing of the capturing device."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable
    video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes (TPMs)
    through the use of an electrostatically actuated deformable membrane mirror (DMM).
    As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), TPMs achieve very high spatial
    resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam to excite fluorescence via
    the simultaneous absorption of two low energy infrared photons to stimulate emission
    in the visible. Because of the increased resolution, and increased penetration
    of infrared light into tissue compared with other LSM methods, TPMs have become
    widely accepted for use in the medical industry, specifically for dermatology
    and neurology. The technology developed for this project will address the $500
    million LSM market by delivering a low-cost, electrically tunable optic capable
    of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an order of
    magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities enabled
    by this technology will result in an advancement of microscopy techniques and
    diagnostic methods, thereby reducing diagnostic time and patient discomfort. Other
    markets that can easily be addressed by this technology include laser marking
    and engraving, endoscopes, optical coherence tomography, and machine vision. \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project will be the development of high-power capable
    coatings for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based deformable mirrors.
    Because these mirrors consist of a thin membrane with a reflective surface, standard
    glass coating processes for solid substrates are incompatible. Instead, the surface
    material for the mirror must be deposited within one of the many fabrication steps
    for the DMM. This project will address the unique challenges of developing high-reflectance
    coatings and incorporate them into the existing DMM fabrication process. The project
    involves four key objectives: 1) developing gold coated deformable mirrors, 2)
    developing protected silver coated deformable mirrors, 3) measuring key performance
    parameters, and 4) measuring and defining the power handling capability and damage
    thresholds of gold and silver DMMs. The anticipated result will be a fully characterized
    DMM capable of long operation under the high-power femtosecond laser illumination
    regime used in two photon microscopes."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditions automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars cost saving from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions, making positive contribution to the planet?s climate and environment. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This projects represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in the underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count, and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors (TruePODS) in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two thirds of all
    those affected by dementia. Despite that Alzheimer's disease is the single most
    expensive disease in the US and falls are the leading cause of hospitalization
    in Alzheimer's care, current tools offer little support. Although 3/4 of elderly
    fallers will experience a repeat fall, solutions like bed alarms and wearable
    fall detection systems offer no way to see how falls occur. Care staff have no
    way of learning from the first fall to reduce the likelihood of the second and
    must implement painful and expensive policies such as sending every unwitnessed
    fall to the emergency room in case a hit to the head occurred. \n\nThe proposed
    project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by detecting falls based
    on camera video where falls can be reviewed by a human assistant in real-time
    and after the fact. Real-time review allows for instant notification if a hit
    to the head occurred, and review after the fact allows for determining the cause
    of the fall to see if changes in room layout and/or policy could be made. The
    primary aim of this project is to collect video data of real falls 1) to apply
    and extend state-of-the-art deep learning methods to perform high accuracy detection
    and 2) to validate that affected individuals, family, and care staff are accepting

    Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) algorithm using domain adaptation
    techniques developed to robustly handle night-vision camera operation, occlusion,
    and non-standard human pose. Technical success will be measured by <1% missed

    accuracy threshold will define a lower bound where, as has been demonstrated repeatedly
    in the deep-learning paradigm, accuracy will continue to improve as more data

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve and automate cognitive health screening mechanisms used in hospital facilities, by designing and validating a smart chair and a smart wearable based health data-centric novel solution. U.S. population has more than 16 million people (this is rapidly growing further) living with cognitive impairment. There is alarming fact that people with cognitive impairment report more than three times as many hospital stays as individuals with other health conditions. These are driving development of improved cognitive health assessment solutions, that will detect subtle signs of cognitive decline early in daily life. Motivated by these markets in demand, this project is designed to develop a system for advanced and remote screening and monitoring of cognitive health, and also enabling gamified user interaction for cognitive rehabilitation. The developed technology has large potential to help elderly people prone to levels of dementia (from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease), and slowly rehabilitating patients dealing with cognitive decline (stroke survivors and cancer patients under treatment). The designed platform and cognitive scoring algorithms developed in this project will be tested and validated with real patient study at hospital facility.


    The proposed project is a research, development and clinical studies effort to design and validate an advanced and remote screening, monitoring and rehabilitation solution for cognitive health. Such cognitive health management system will be achieved by technological innovation in multi-modal sensing and machine learning based behavioral data analytics from a smart chair and a custom wearable device (used separately), along with cognitive psychology driven gamified interactions and interventions. The smart chair system will capture patient non-verbal response and stress patterns, when answering to cognitive questionnaire. The smart wearable system (used with a few custom Bluetooth beacons in proximity) will analyze normalcy, forgetfulness, confusion in patient, while performing daily life cognitive tasks (such as baking a cake or cookie) in home-like kitchen facility in hospital. The main research objective includes two novel cognitive health scoring mechanism from user response with chair based cognitive questionnaire, and wearable based cognitive task performance quality. It will also design user interactions and interventions for cognitive rehabilitation and behavior reinforcement. This is a very impactful project with team's direct ongoing collaboration with hospital and neurologist, and access to large number of patients with range of cognitive disabilities (in accordance with IRB and HIPAA compliance).

    This STTR Phase I project looks to create a solution to the vast problem that hernia has become in the United States by developing a system that prevents hernia before it occurs. There are an estimated 300,000 hernia repairs performed each year in the US. Incisional hernia (IH) occurs in up to 70% in high-risk populations. The hernia epidemic is significant and is linked to reduced quality of life and $3.2 billion/year in healthcare expenditures for hernia repair. IH can be prevented using prophylactic mesh, which involves placement of tensioned mesh to reinforce abdominal fascia closures before herniation occurs. Prophylactic mesh has been shown to reduce the risk of IH from 35.9% to 1.5%. However, although prophylactic mesh produces outstanding results, it has not become widely adopted in part due to the technical challenge that the procedure poses and added operative time. This project aims to create a system that makes the prophylactic mesh procedure simpler, more reliable, and faster. This project offers an efficient solution to the hernia epidemic by addressing key surgeon-level barriers to adoption of prophylactic mesh and therefore will foster more widespread use of the procedure. Broader use of hernia prevention will improve outcomes, quality of life, and reduce the costs associated with IH.

    This project proposes the development of a hand-held system that simplifies and reduces the time to perform prophylactic mesh augmentation by integrating multiple discrete operative tasks including locating, tensioning, and affixing mesh onto the abdominal fascia. The system provides an optimized strategy for prophylactic mesh placement by leveraging biomechanical principles of both the abdominal wall and mesh to provide a quick, standardized, and reliable method to strengthen abdominal incisions and as a result minimize the risk of herniation. The system is comprised of three main components: the applicator, the fastener-anchor, and the mesh itself. The fastener-anchor represents a core functionality of the technology while serving two purposes: (1.) interaction/engagement and subsequent tension-setting of the mesh via the applicator system; and (2.) penetration of the fascia and affixation of the mesh onto the fascia. The applicator is a simple, ergonomic tool that interfaces with the fastener-anchors, allowing the surgeon to control the spatial position, tension, and placement of the mesh. This project aims to accomplish two main goals: (1.) to refine the device design, including achieving optimal security and reliability of engagement between the applicator and the fastener-anchors and (2.) to assess the biomechanical strength and speed of the proposed technology compared to current standards of care. Through iterative device prototyping, testing, and refinement, a fully functional device will be developed.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the storage of hydrogen on a novel material produced from silicon - the same substance used to make solar panels and computer chips. This unique and patented approach has the potential to eclipse all prior methods of hydrogen storage in terms of pressure, temperature, safety, cost, and convenience. Silicon is earth-abundant and benign to humans - it is even promotes healthy skin, hair, and fingernails. The implication of hydrogen-in-silicon is that fuel cell-powered vehicles, homes, and electronics can be far more efficient and clean than any other source of energy. Of great significance is that this technology will allow homeowners and businesses to generate their own hydrogen by splitting water using rooftop solar panels. By storing this as hydrogen-in-silicon a home can be run overnight or for many days during a cloudy spell. Hydrogen can replace the batteries in portable electronics so they can last up to 20 days without a recharge - far longer than with batteries. And if the rooftop system is of sufficient size, one can produce the hydrogen needed for a fuel cell vehicle, such as those already on the market. The implications of this are far-reaching, allowing complete energy independence for all, for all time to come, with minimal environmental impact and using almost completely renewable and low-cost resources which are easy to recycle.


    Porous silicon is easy to synthesize but requires a catalyst to recharge from a gaseous source. The introduction of the catalyst is critical as it must be controlled spatially and positioned to effect spillover onto and off of silicon. Density Functional Theory studies show this is energetically favorable and first-order macroscopic calculations indicate that recharge can be effected in 3.5 minutes at 8 bar and 250 C. The overall energy difference between fully-charged and fully-discharged silicon-hydrogen is an amazingly low 1 kcal/mol. The energy barrier is the strong H-H bond which dominates the kinetics. The course of this project is to strategically place palladium atoms at specific sites on the matrix of porous silicon so that it can mediate the H-H bond energy and allow spillover onto the 800 m^2/gm surface area of microporous silicon. This has been patented but never demonstrated in the laboratory, which is why this funding from NSF is needed. A further goal of this work is to demonstrate the viability of low-cost silicon using metallurgical grade material instead of the single-crystal silicon which has been used to date.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide an affordable mobile digital pathology
    solution to pathologists in order to facilitate their clinical practices in disease
    diagnosis, peer consultations, tumor board preparations, research and education.
    The low-cost smartphone based portable pathology slide scanner is a complementary
    solution to current high throughput expensive digital pathology equipment to allow
    whole slide imaging to penetrate across all tiers of market. Given the high owning
    rate of mobile devices, the increasing processing and transmission speed, and
    the versatility of mobile apps, this device brings whole slide imaging at fingertips
    of individual pathologists. This greatly simplifies intra- and inter- institutional
    consultations and tumor board preparations, which enhances our fundamental understanding
    of disease causes and in turn leads to possible cures with improved clinical outcomes.
    The device also reduces the needs for physical transport of glass slides or tissue
    blocks to centralized digital imaging equipment. It also provides strong support
    on timely and accurate diagnosis, especially for those remote to digital imaging
    equipment. Moreover, this study provides an effective approach for teaching foundational
    skills of whole slide imaging to the next-generation pathologists.\n \nThe proposed
    project is to validate the technical feasibility of using smartphone based portable
    slide scanner for acquiring pathological slide images with the optical performance
    comparable or close to those by commercial high-end slide scanners. This device
    is based on an innovative zoom-microscope design, where elastomer-liquid lenses
    with low optical aberration are used for changing the zoom ratio. This portable
    device can reach the optical magnification of 10X-40X and nearly diffraction-limited
    resolution with small lens diameters (<10mm), meeting the imaging requirement
    by pathologists. In this study, a prototype will be developed to demonstrate image
    acquisition, scanning, and transmission capabilities using representative mobile
    devices on the market. The minimal resolvable feature size under each magnification
    will be examined and compared with those of high-end commercial slide scanners.
    The minimal magnification increment based on the selected actuation mechanism
    will be experimentally determined. The images of pathological slides acquired
    under the same magnification or different magnifications will be stitched together
    to generate a large field-of-view while retaining the resolution. The stitched
    images will be sent to pathologists to solicit feedbacks for iterative design
    optimization."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hyper-personalized, clinical,

    transfusions, transfusion-related complications, and transfusion related expenditures.
    Blood transfusions are the most commonly prescribed medical procedure in the US,
    and cost our healthcare system $30 billion annually. The cost of unnecessary transfusions
    is estimated at no less than $15 billion each year. These figures double when
    including the cost of treating transfusion-related complications. In the era of

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses a major obstacle and opportunity in the present nanotechnology boom, the need for improved microscope capabilities.  The growth of public investment in nanotechnology, from zero in 2000 to $68 billion in 2012, reflects the technical and commercial advantages of miniaturizing structural and chemical engineering to the nanoscale.  Missing are microscopes capable of resolving such structures and chemistries with sufficient accuracy: atomic-scale resolution in three dimensions (3D).  If successful, this project will demonstrate a new microscope that bridges this gap.  Based on atom microscope by projection (AMP) technology, the new AMP microscope will image the position and identity of every atom in 3D.  Complete atomic resolution will provide critical missing information to research scientists and more accurate inspection technology for manufacturing quality assurance.  Revealing atomic origins of properties, AMP microscopes will accelerate transition from trial-and-error experimentation to computer-based design, allowing significant savings of time and money in research and development.

    The intellectual merit of this project focuses on investigating feasibility of creating the first microscope capable of resolving the position and identity of every atom, in three dimensions, for billions of atoms per analysis.  This represents a 100-fold spatial resolution improvement and a 2-fold chemical resolution improvement.  AMP combines field-ion microscopy and field-evaporation time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  Prototype AMP experiments spatially imaged 100% of atoms with 3D sub-angstrom resolution but only chemically identified 57%.  This is the detection limit of using a multi-purpose detector for both spatial and chemical resolution.  To reach 100% atomic spatial and chemical resolution, this project will model, simulate, and experimentally test feasibility of novel ion optics to separate the spatial resolution information from the chemical resolution information, enabling use of single-purpose detectors for each and improving quality.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the alleviation of several current difficulties in the growth measurement of many bacterial species, especially anaerobic and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally occurring in the human body, and they have recently been shown to play critical roles in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response, and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases, such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is therefore a large unmet need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows. The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million and growing; the proposed technology will expand that market to fields it has never served.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop technology for measuring growth of many bacterial samples in a format much smaller than currently available high-throughput devices. The rise of systems and computational biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data; the variety of microbes in the human body necessitates such an approach. However, this type of data is currently nearly impossible to collect in anaerobic and other specialized environments. This project aims to bring high-throughput growth measurement techniques to these environments by creating simplified, miniaturized hardware paired with advanced real-time analysis and control software. The project?s first objective is to refine a novel proof-of-concept optical density measurement method to achieve accuracy and precision comparable to traditional techniques, and verify using bacterial growth and inorganic liquid testing. The next goal is to design a hardware enclosure small and robust enough to allow compatibility with the smallest and most taxing environments. Finally, software will be developed to manage a high number of bacterial experiments (and devices) running in parallel without sacrificing data fidelity or high resolution. It is anticipated that the resulting high-throughput measurement system will greatly expand researchers' abilities to characterize microbes of increasing clinical relevance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a novel clinical genomics software analysis platform that may help reduce or eliminate some of the most significant challenges associated with genetic testing. In the US, genomics plays a role in 9 of the 10 leading causes of death including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. As such, genetic testing is growing very rapidly, as are some of the associated challenges of scale, performance, cost and quality.  Genomic medicine and genetic testing are key underpinnings of precision medicine, which may help lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention of complex diseases and disorders. This feasibility study targets the development of an advanced analysis software platform to address analysis bottlenecks and ultimately improve time-to-treatment. The team will determine feasibility based on prototyping key technologies and methods to address current state limitations and point towards an improved future-state approach.  The study will be done in close collaboration with actual clinical genomics users to deliver clear and compelling benefits to the target market and end-users and to provide a high-value solution to the rapidly growing market segment.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to design and prototype a novel genomics software analysis platform.  It will include access to a large work bench of bioinformatics applications and performance optimized clinical analysis workflows running on scalable public cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant computing infrastructure. The platform will be developed following the software-as-a-service model, designed to optimize performance and costs for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The project will entail development of advanced proprietary computational algorithms to parallelize execution of analysis tasks, and the creation of highly optimized genomics analysis workflows. These workflows will result in dramatic time-savings as well as reduced costs compared to current state approaches. Project efforts also will focus on the development of sophisticated resource provisioning logic to exploit scale and cost optimization running on public cloud infrastructure. In addition, the project will include the feasibility of developing a dual-purpose platform for R&D and clinical usage for faster testing and adoption of newer and advanced tools and procedures. The technology will help to improve patient care by delivering results substantially faster, with higher quality and at lower cost. Additionally, users will be able to construct and validate custom analysis workflows that meet HIPAA, CLIA-CAP, and other clinical requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a confocal optical microscope with two-dimensional topographical profiling and multiple spectroscopic modes in a single, affordable precision instrument. The system will make a major impact in the $6.2 billion microscope market, with a near-term market penetration potential of over 5%, and significant growth potential. This technology will span the needs of materials science research laboratories through quality control in manufacturing to supply chain monitoring. Integration of topographic mapping with a diverse set of spectroscopic tools enables comprehensive materials analysis at the micron and submicron scale. Users will be able to identify features and defects in electronic, optoelectronic, and structural devices, as well as coatings, tubing, devices, disks, and specialty mirrors. Combinatorial materials and chemical research will also be furthered by the ability to acquire several spectroscopic maps with a single instrument. Societal impacts include practical improvements in the design and manufacture of components and systems.  Because of its compact size and low cost, the microscope can be used in schools at all levels, providing students with experience in measuring properties of complex objects and helping prepare them for careers in various research, development, and production settings.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the advancement of optical microscopy into the realm of spectroscopic and surface analysis of topographically complex structures. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), for example, have micron-to-millimeter features that can be analyzed by the developed instrument. The key innovation is the development of precision profiling and its integration with multiple spectroscopic interrogation methods. This profiling innovation centers on the capture of two-dimensional optical images with an array detector from each point on a sample and the conversion of the image properties to a vertical focus error, which is then corrected in a subsequent spectroscopic scan. The instrument can then provide Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and topographic surface (morphology) mapping of a sample, with diffraction-limited resolution. Research objectives include integration of optical profiling with spectroscopic scanning to produce accurate two-dimensional spectra from topographically rough samples, and automation of the image capture and analysis software. The instrument is designed to capture the surface topography and spectrum of a sample with tens of thousands of sample points in a few minutes and with 10-50 nanometer vertical accuracy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the expansion of autonomous unmanned aerial systems (UAS, or drones) to new maritime operational environments and commercial markets. The proposed technology will enable small UAS to operate from vessels moving at sea, without the need for a dedicated pilot or installed hardware, even while far from shore and beyond the reach of established communication networks. Small UAS can offer the same aerial perspective provided by manned helicopters at a fraction of the size, cost, and risk. Real-time aerial imagery from UAS will supply maritime operators with invaluable information about their surroundings at sea, which is not available by any other means. This information is critical for many maritime applications, including fishing, ocean monitoring, scientific exploration, maritime surveillance, and search, and rescue. This information will offer a particularly large and immediate impact for 98% of worldwide commercial fishing vessels (those that do not carry embarked manned helicopters for fish-finding) by dramatically reducing their fuel costs; providing net economic and environmental gains for the industry.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop algorithms and software to enable small UAS autonomously and reliably land onto a moving platform at sea. Commercially-available small UAS can offer invaluable real-time aerial imagery for maritime operators. But, this technology is not currently in widespread use due to technological barriers. In particular, the key enabling technology is the ability to autonomously and reliably land a small UAS onto a moving platform. The research objective is to develop algorithms and software that enable small UAS to autonomously operate from moving vessels at sea. Computer vision algorithms automatically detect the host vessel and the dedicated landing area. Data fusion algorithms estimate the relative drone-boat position and orientation in real time, including compensation for vessel roll, pitch, & heave. Precision control algorithms optimize the drone?s trajectory for save, reliable, autonomous launch and landing. A prototype system will be built by integrating the STTR-developed software with commercially available hardware components.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this small business Innovative
    Research Phase 1 project is the possibility of inexpensive clean water generation
    from sea and brackish water.  With rapidly increasing world population, portable
    water will be one of the most important technological challenges of this century.
    There is no unique ?one size fits all? approach to desalination. Many factors
    such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment
    requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting
    the desalination technology to be implemented. The carbon nanotube enhanced membrane
    distillation proposed here is a relatively low temperature process where industrial
    waste heat and solar heating can be used for desalination. Small water heaters
    such as the natural gas heaters used in homes can be used to generate high quality
    drinking water along with what is needed for domestic consumption. Another major
    application of this technology is in oil and gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing
    or fracking is a water-intensive process. A typical frack well uses several million
    gallons of water over its lifetime and generates a highly saline ?produced water?.
    \  With its ability to handle high salt concentrations, the proposed approach
    is a viable alternative for treating this waste.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this project are to utilize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create breakthrough
    membrane properties for desalination via membrane distillation (MD). In MD, a
    hydrophobic porous membrane separates a hot salt water feed and a cold permeate
    stream.  As the heated brine passes on the membrane and is partially transformed
    to water vapor. The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution
    from entering the pores. However, freed from hydrogen bonding the water vapor
    passes through and is condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The novel
    membranes referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membranes (CNIM) will be
    developed by immobilizing CNTs into membrane pores where they will serve as molecular
    transporters and sorbents, thus providing additional pathways for water vapor
    transport. The other major advantage of CNIM is that it is less prone to fouling
    than conventional membranes. Key innovations of the proposal include the functionalization
    of CNTs for maximization of water vapor transport while minimizing fouling.  Additional
    objectives include the study of fouling behavior of some commercially important
    water samples such as sea water, power plant effluents and produced water. Finally,
    a process optimization tool will be developed to optimize CNIM-MD design."

    The research results will address the resolution and detection speed requirements
    of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next
    major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving which will
    bring great potential benefits in terms of safety, mobility and related productivity.
    With the proposed advanced sensing system and intelligent algorithms, it is expected
    that future autonomous driving vehicle could eliminate mistakes due to human error
    which is the main cause of traffic accidents. Moreover, it may lead to reduced
    traffic jam, higher energy efficiency and much enhanced mobility for the aging
    and disabled population. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact.
    In 2015, the global market size of automotive millimeter wave (30 ? 300 GHz) radars
    hit about $1.936 billion; it is expected to reach $2.46 billion in 2016 and $5.12
    billion in 2020, having the most remarkable growth potentials in the field of
    electronic products. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancement
    in a number of important market sectors including wireless communication, sensing,
    mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing. \n\nThis Small
    Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project attempts to realize a high
    performance automotive radar using 3D printed Luneburg Lens for autonomous driving.
    The existing automotive radar products do not have enough angular coverage and
    resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving
    autonomous driving. As a result, the current autonomous driving tests utilize
    LiDAR systems which are expensive and less reliable than radar especially under
    certain conditions such as heavy rain, snow, fog, smoke and sandstorms. Compared
    to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing technique,
    which is much more convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter
    wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams
    with high gain and broadband behavior, novel automotive radar will be designed
    by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with wide bandwidth and
    natural beam forming capabilities of Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach
    is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby
    or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to
    achieve a high performance and low cost millimeter-wave sensing system which will
    be suitable for autonomous transportation applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is the development of drought-tolerant crops through biotechnology, which is potentially both economically and environmentally important.  Genetic engineering of drought tolerance has been very recalcitrant because of the complexity of plant responses to water stress. The proposed technology offers novel features to overcome the current limitations.  Commercial deployment of this technology will improve significantly the profitability of growers and seed companies, and will benefit society by enabling crop production on arid lands.  The primary target market is the genetically engineered corn seed industry.  A significant market opportunity is present if corn can be modified to express drought tolerance.  Corn is the second most plentiful cereal grown for human consumption and animal feeds, and accounts for over 43% of the $47 billion global seed market. The commercial strategy will be to penetrate the market by partnering with the major corn seed companies as well as mid-size seed companies with expertise in breeding, commercial seed production, marketing, and sales.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a proprietary and potentially transformative technology to increase drought tolerance in plants.  It utilizes a plant's natural response system to better protect it from drought stress.  This drought tolerance mechanism is employed in a highly drought-specific manner to avoid the growth penalty often observed with drought tolerance technologies. In addition, this drought tolerance is achieved with limited perturbation of other biological processes in the plants. Until its effectiveness is validated under field conditions, the technical risk of the technology remains very high and engaging potential industry partners likely will be difficult. The goal of this project is to obtain the field verification data that is needed to decrease the technical risk, thus making it attractive to potential licensing partners. The company will reach the goal by achieving two specific objectives:  1) Identification and selection of transgenic lines that show strong drought tolerance under greenhouse conditions, and 2) Conducting field tests to validate the greenhouse performance.  Successful completion of this project would enable the company to have a broad licensing strategy directed towards corn seed companies for commercialization.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will generate a new nanoparticle characterization system with the ability to assess the size, length-to-width ratio, zeta potential, and concentration of solution-based nanoparticle (or molecular) samples with state-of-the-art accuracy, precision, and resolution, all on a single platform. The primary need for new nanoparticle characterization instrumentation is driven by the increasing utility and benefit of nanoparticles in healthcare and medicine, including nanoparticle drug delivery, nanoscale particle/molecule drugs and therapies, and nanoparticle-based imaging and diagnostics agents. The prototype system developed under this program will be targeted toward the general nanoparticle characterization market, presently estimated at ~$500M, which includes applications in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, nanoparticle manufacturing, R&D, and academic research. The developed system will not only improve solution-based nanoparticle characterization, but streamline characterization processes and provide new insights with regard to sample characterization, optimization, and utilization within the nanoparticle field.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a completely new and innovative particle characterization system for which there is no equivalent, capable of automated, high-resolution, solution-based particle assessments at the single-molecule level.  The developed system will enable the ability to quickly characterize a large number (hundreds to thousands) of particles/molecules in solution in order to assess the distribution within the sample. These goals will be reached by developing, building, and validating a complete and fully functioning alpha-prototype system and then demonstrating the functionality and utility of the new system by characterizing solution-based particle- and molecule-containing samples that otherwise cannot be characterized with high resolution. Upon completing this program, an entirely new nanoparticle characterization instrument will be developed and validated that is ready for initial introductions into the nanoparticle field via industrial and academic communities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a disruptive tow tension control technology specifically designed for the unique processing variables of composite material manufacturing to solve the limiting factor of tension control the industry currently faces. In composites manufacturing multiple materials with different tensile strengths and elasticity are combined to make a stronger product, and the lack of affordable tension control has up to this point limited the speed and quality of finished products within the industry. By controlling tension there are fewer gaps, uneven tows, and breaks, resulting in higher quality end product and reduced scrap rates. The composites industry is forecasted to grow at a 7% compound annual growth rate to $10.9 billion in 2018 despite these manufacturing limitations. By removing the limiting factor of tension control it is estimated that production could expand 15%-25%, increasing the growth of this industry even further. With composites? primary and growing role in renewable energy, aerospace, construction, automobiles, pipe and tank, and consumer goods, a manufacturer?s ability to remove limitations to effectively meet demand without sacrificing quality will be critical. Expanded productivity will allow for greater innovation with composites within existing industries and promote their use in new industries.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on determining the feasibility of a Modular Tensioning Cartridge for composites manufacturing. The objectives of this project are 1) to determine if tension can be controlled near or at zero, 2) to achieve miniaturization of the unit for multiple use applications, and 3) to determine cost targets and economic feasibility. Research will be conducted to develop a load cell (sensing unit) capable of detecting minor (gram) changes in output in relation to key considerations of beam loading and sensing capability, through testing of multiple design, shape, and material combinations. Further research and testing will be conducted to discover heat dissipation requirements, fuzzing risks and solutions, and determine design and material requirements in order to achieve proper miniaturization of the full unit. Final research will be conducted to validate the economic value proposition of the unit to customers based on unit quality, size, performance, and service life in relation to cost and additional output/productivity generated. The team will determine the viability of load cell technology as a sensing device, and the combination of materials and design that will meet sizing, performance, and cost requirements.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will include
    a research program to prepare new materials for a novel sensor to detect when
    a water softener needs regeneration. The adoption of a low cost, accurate water
    hardness sensor can drive a substantial reduction in both the amount of salt released
    into municipal sewer systems and the amount of water used to rinse the resins.
    The patent-pending hardness sensor can replace more expensive and less effective
    components and approaches that are currently utilized by water softeners to initiate
    regeneration. This will enable penetration into markets which have been underserved
    due to environmental concerns about salt discharge. Manufacturers of softeners
    will benefit from the proposed hardness sensor, because it will modernize their
    regeneration controls while also improving water softening efficiency and environmental
    sustainability. Annual global water softener sales growth is around 8%. With a
    15-20% market penetration, sensor sales could be around $90 million (water softener
    model). The proposed development of ion-exchange fibers is expected to have applications
    beyond hardness sensors. The same approach can be used to make anion-exchange
    fibers that can be employed for the detection of nitrate in devices similar to
    softeners to remove nitrate from drinking water. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is the development of a new method for making ion-exchange fibers.
    The proposed work will build upon past research performed and will culminate in
    the development of commercially available cation-exchange fibers that can be used
    for hardness sensors and other applications. There is a substantial benefit of
    using the cation-exchange material of the hardness sensor. The sensor detects
    the electrical resistance of the entire mass of the cation exchange material between
    the electrodes. Earlier experiments indicate that cation-exchange fibers offer
    superior performance compared to membranes, but no commercially available fibers
    exist. After reliable fibers have been produced, they will be installed in hardness
    sensors to be evaluated using small column testing equipment at The University
    of Texas at El Paso, as well as in water softeners outside of the university to
    validate the salt and water savings potential. The proposed research will include
    not only sensor development, but also the measurement and control needed to automatically
    sense hardness and control regeneration in both a water softener resin bed and
    for the sensor itself."

    It is a critical challenge to locate an implanted device, interventional device,
    needle biopsy device, or lesion that is planned to be removed during a surgical
    procedure. The proposed study provides a way to overcome the abovementioned challenge
    by taking advantage of an internal sound source which can be directly visualize
    via a hybrid augmented reality technology. As an example of breast cancer surgery,
    a direct tumor visualization tool will greatly reduce the surgical time and improve
    the surgical outcome. This innovation will bring considerable market opportunity.
    According to the market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will
    reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual
    growth rate of 14.5%. With the value we potentially provide, our total addressable
    market is estimated to ~$200 million in 2020, which is a considerable and healthy
    market.  Other market including visualization of an interventional device or implanted
    device will further increase the value of the proposed innovation. \n\nThis proposed
    project is to develop an intraoperative tool to visually locate the breast tumor
    with high accuracy. In 2015, there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer,
    and an estimated 60,290 additional cases of noninvasive breast cancer. It is challenging
    for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially
    when the tumor is non-palpable. However, the current technologies cannot provide
    quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of
    that location. Therefore, it creates problems on a large re-excision rate, and
    a prolonged surgical time.  The project proposes to address these unmet needs
    by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can
    provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter
    variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization
    of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using
    acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized,
    omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this technology has
    the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays and reduce

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to provide deep insights into the DNA of patients in one hour at one-fourth the cost. This will allow hospitals, clinics and research centers to delve faster into the genetic information of the patients and return essential insights to physicians, leading to faster decisions on therapy. Analyzing DNA data holds the promise of detecting several diseases and can also help in pinpointing their genetic origins, which will be key for treatment of vulnerable cases such as newborn babies, people with rare diseases, and pregnant women. By providing the analysis of whole DNA data in one hour as compared to several days, DNA tests can become mainstream, thereby reducing anxiety among patients and their relatives. As the number of patients for which deep DNA analysis will be required is doubling every year, this project aims to meet the exploding demands of large scale computational genomics of the future and enable deep DNA analysis for all patients.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use the power of state of the art cloud computing platforms to provide analysis for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data in one hour. Several key researchers have shown that data from WGS is a critical requirement for accurate insights and detailed analysis of underlying diseases for various diseases including leukemia, breast Cancer, ADHD, Alzheimer's, congenital heart disease, HIV susceptibility, as well as others as information in the non-coding region is required. However, the computational analysis for WGS data takes several days and will be the major bottleneck for utilizing key WGS data to personalize the treatment for the affected patient. This project aims to use several high performance computing techniques on the cloud that will be tailored for NGS analyses and can accelerate the process by more than 40 times. This project uses a disruptive technology that breaks algorithms to work independently on nodes on the cloud and the team has created a collection of software optimizations to improve the utilization of cloud resources. This toolbox of optimizations is being applied to commonly used software tools in computational genomics for faster analysis.

    to then rapidly construct and test vast numbers of these predicted sensors, identifying
    those with the requisite sensing and response characteristics in yeast. The resulting

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in helping people cultivate healthy lifestyles. Over the last few decades, an epidemic of lifestyle diseases has developed in the United States. Unhealthy lifestyles, such as inactivity, poor nutrition and sedentary behaviors are driving up the prevalence of chronic disease such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. As of 2012, about 117 million people had one or more chronic health conditions. Although chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes are among the most common and costly of all diseases, simply adopting healthy lifestyles can prevent many of these chronic diseases. About 86% of all health care spending in 2010 was for chronic medical conditions. Preventive approaches can offset current healthcare costs. However, prevention is typically implemented as labor-intensive coaching or mobile health apps that lack sufficient personalization to be effective. The technology platform being developed in this project will combine the best of both mobile and in-person coaching for a fraction of the cost of in-person coaching.

    The proposed project will help people to cultivate lifestyle changes. For a lifestyle disease patient, it is very difficult to change lifelong habits to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of a doctor or coach is a long standing problem. Several reminder and tracker apps attempt to help with compliance and adoption of healthy lifestyle. Unlike such solutions, our approach is unique in its ability to proactively intervene with highly targeted interventions at the right moment, which is when compliance is most likely. Such moments will be captured through the ability of the platform to incorporate context-sensitivity. The platform will understand the context of each patient and will enable the coach to deliver interventional messages at the right moment, thereby increasing the likelihood of compliance and assisting with formation of healthy habits. The platform also provides scalability without significant loss in personalization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to optimize and reduce agro-chemical and irrigation applications for the United States agricultural industry, reducing environmental contamination, and increasing overall crop health and production with a smart phone compatible miniaturized optical sensor. The diagnostic sensor, designed for use in the precision agriculture market sector, captures optical spectrographs of a plant that can be used to diagnose the overall health of the plant, and provide recommendations for optimizing care. In discerning whether a plant suffers from a nutrient deficiency, a water stress, or a disease pressure, the sensor provides a means for substantial commercial impact. By providing this market sector with the needed quantitative information to both specialize and optimize crop treatment plans, substantial agro-chemical and irrigation resources are saved. From a societal perspective, these commercial savings directly translate into reduced agro-chemical applications of crops, which help reduce eutrophication of environmental water bodies, protecting drinking water supplies. By optimizing irrigation usage, the sensor reduces irrigation demands, helping ensure the longevity of these sources of irrigation. By enabling big data analysis of optical spectrographs that correlate with underlying crop health conditions, the project provides insight into physiological factors governing crop health, advancing scientific understanding.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is directed towards miniaturizing high precision optical spectrophotometers, traditionally confined to laboratory usage, for use in precision agriculture. The agricultural industry struggles to identify or anticipate changes in crop health and take appropriate measures of response. As multiple environmental stressors or factors can cause similar visual symptoms in a crop, optimal decision-making becomes decidedly difficult, and can lead to costly commercial and societal impacts. In response to this problem, this project aims to first develop a handheld smart phone-based spectrophotometer for real time diagnosis of crop health. Afterwards, the capabilities of the device will be extensively tested in controlled greenhouse studies of crops under varying nutrient and hydration conditions. Finally, the data collected in these studies will be analyzed and benchmarked against gold standard techniques of assessment. From these studies, the performance of the optical sensor will be clearly assessed. Specifically, the degree to which the sensor can discern amongst varying environmental stressors affecting a crop, and also the degree to which the sensor can provide quantitative feedback about the severity of those stressors, will be provided.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the
    proposed flexible battery technology solves the major problems (e.g. mechanical
    failure, low capacity) of the existing battery designs for wearable/flexible electronics
    (e.g. smart watches, apparel, eye wear, and medical patches). Xerion Advanced
    Battery Corporation (XABC)?s battery design can potentially close the current
    technological gap between electronic devices and their supporting batteries and
    further accelerate the wearable/flexible electronics sector, which is expected
    to grow at 53.7% compounded annual growth rate. The development of this battery
    technology will provide important scientific insights and practical guidance towards
    various fundamental principles of battery designs such as stress handling, form
    factor adaptability, assembly, integration, and energy and power optimization.
    Furthermore, XABC?s novel battery fabrication technique, which utilizes a high
    throughput electroplating process to produce battery grade materials and electrodes,
    has the potential to drive innovations in other energy storage initiatives (e.g.
    high-energy, low-cost batteries for automotive) in both academia and industry.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes an
    innovative flexible battery design to meet the growing demand for wearable/flexible
    electronics.  The proposed flexible batteries are made of electrodes realized
    via directly electroplating high-quality, high-energy battery materials on current
    collectors. In most existing flexible batteries, battery materials are bonded
    by polymer binders, resulting in loose contacts during bending and thus loss of
    battery materials. In contrast, the electroplated materials are chemically bonded
    to the current collector, which significantly enhances the electrode integrity
    during repeated bending and deformation. Such strong bonding also enables fast
    electron transport in the electrode and thus boosts the battery power. Here, XABC
    will develop high-performance flexible batteries via its patented electroplating
    technique. Research will focus on investigating various aspects of the flexible
    battery design including electroplating optimization, current collector selection,
    battery assembly, and packaging. XABC will demonstrate capability of making fully
    packaged flexible battery prototypes with various form factors for flexible electronics
    and perform detailed electrochemical and mechanical characterization. The proposed
    flexible battery prototype is expected to show high energy, high power, and excellent
    capacity retention after thousands of bending and deformation cycles."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, bioabsorbable surgical
    clip and applicator for rapid closure of the dura mater in open and minimally
    invasive spine surgery. The dura mater is the protective membrane that covers
    the brain and spinal cord and contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Openings in
    the dura (durotomy) can result in CSF leakage which, if not repaired, can cause
    potentially fatal complications including spinal headaches, pseudomeningocele,
    and meningitis. Currently, the dura is closed using fine suture in a difficult
    and time-consuming process requiring upwards of 30 minutes of additional operating
    room time. Durotomies occur in approximately 10% of spinal surgeries and with
    1.7M spinal surgeries, closure of incidental durotomies costs the healthcare system
    an estimated $408M each year. Utilization of a bioabsorbable clip and applicator
    system for dural closure will significantly increase the rate of repair, simplify
    the work of clinicians, and reduce surgery time and overall costs to the healthcare
    system. Use of this technology could be expanded to closure of cranial dura, as
    well as other surgical specialties such as urology, OB/GYN, and general surgery.
    \n\nThe proposed project aims to develop a bioabsorbable, non-penetrating clip
    for rapid closure of the dura mater in spine surgery. The goal is to produce clips
    capable of closing dura and holding a water tight seal as compared to the current
    standard of care. This project will include developing a clip made entirely out
    of a biocompatible, bioabsorbable polymer that will safely degrade in the body
    after the dura has healed. The clips will also be radiolucent (invisible to x-ray
    and computed tomography imaging) to allow for unobstructed imaging of the surgical
    site. In addition, the clips will be non-penetrating to avoid lacerating the dura,
    reducing the risk of CSF leakage and possible fatal medical complications. This
    project also aims to develop an inexpensive, disposable applicator system that
    will apply the clips for dural closure. The applicator will be designed for use
    in both open and minimally invasive surgery and will house a reservoir of clips
    for complete dural closure without removal of the applicator from the surgical
    site for reloading."

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses a critical need in medicine ? the ability to deliver drugs selectively to parts of the body that need medication.  Targeted drug delivery improves patient outcomes by treating tissues locally while reducing overall exposure and side effects elsewhere. For example, a cream or lotion type product which moves anti-inflammatory drugs through skin specifically to an affected joint is better than taking a pill which medicates the entire body. Nanoparticles, especially liposomes (nanometer size water balloons consisting of a fatty wall surrounding an aqueous interior) are useful for targeted drug delivery because of their ability to move through biological barriers including skin. Unfortunately, use of liposomes is limited because the drug carrying capacity is too small, especially for water insoluble drugs.  Lipoleosomes are a new type of liposome with a much greater carrying capacity for drugs.  The objective of this project is to make lipoleosomes with ibuprofen, a water-insoluble drug and demonstrate the ability to move ibuprofen through skin for localized treatment of joints and muscles. This will be valuable for developing a lotion product to treat arthritis and injuries while avoiding stomach problems.

    The creation of lipoleosomes resulted from a remarkable discovery ? that under certain conditions, flat fatty layers (lipid bilayers) existing in microemulsions can be reshaped by hydration into spherical liposome form. Because microemulsion lipid bilayers can contain large amounts of water-insoluble (hydrophobic) compounds (easily up to 65%), so can the product liposomes. Previously, hydrophobic drug content of liposomes rarely exceeded 5%. In light of the extraordinarily greater drug capacity, the new liposomes were named lipoleosomes, indicating a liposome into which organic compounds (oleo) have been inserted.  It is a scientific curiosity that some microemulsion lipid layers reshape to give membrane structures because in the past, hydration had only been known to give filled emulsion droplets which do not have the important biological features of liposomes. In this project, the quality and yield of lipoleosomes and their biological characteristics will be improved by understanding the influence of precursor microemulsion properties and processing conditions. This will result in the availability of new, biologically effective lipoleosomal ibuprofen compositions and methods of synthesis, plus physical and biometric data that supports submission of a new drug application for a topical ibuprofen lotion or cream. Establishing lipoleosomes as a new type of nanoparticle has implications for many other drugs and for routes of administration other than dermal.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project would be to make it safer to send premature babies home after their stay in the NICU. They will be more likely to grow and thrive while they regain valuable bonding time with their parents. The risk of having to readmit babies would go down. Complications and maybe even SIDS could be reduced, because we would have a better way to measure and understand the development of these babies after they leave the hospital but continue to mature for the first year. Our physicians are excellent, but their decisions can only be as reliable as the information they are provided. Many cases doctors are forced to make difficult decisions between keeping a baby longer at greater cost and further separation or sending the baby home to begin a new life, but at the risk that the baby's central nervous system may not be quite up to the job of keeping the basic heart, lung and temperature at the right levels. This project will give physicians better more accurate information to reduce the guesswork and keep the babies safe.

    The proposed project will result in a miniature throw away sensor strip that nurses stick on the outer eyelid of a premature baby. The technology, called OMT allows us to read the innermost control signals of the deepest and most important part of the brain called the brainstem. Neuroscientists now know that one of the most important jobs that the brainstem does is to help control the most basic primitive life functions such as changing the rate of breathing, body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate.  Develop a thin film sensor and instrument that is capable of successfully recording brainstem biosignals in premature babies, both technically and physiologically, and; demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between pre-terms with and without discharge problems The project plan is to complete the design and assembly of the instrument and to sample the data from a late pre-term infant to determine basic viability of signal and satisfactory detection. Following that the team will produce a small lot of sensors and several test units to measure 9-18 young patients in three cohorts. This basic validation of the instrument and clinical value is the key next step to successful commercialization of the product.

    Phase I project is to improve access to high-quality, responsive, and evidence-based
    treatments for risky users of alcohol and other drugs. Current standards of care
    are cost-prohibitive, time-intensive and overly reliant on community support groups
    lacking a scientific basis or a mechanism for accountability. The research proposed

    a range of available data from users of an online substance use recovery platform,
    this research will identify the data most correlated with successful recovery
    from substance use. Regression modeling and bivariate correlations will explore
    the relationships between different data within the platform and several validated
    outcome measures already integrated into the intervention. This research will
    use discourse analysis and natural language processing to identify and categorize
    user-submitted content to identify linguistic elements related to substance use
    recovery or risk of relapse. The principal outcome will be a holistic measure
    of recovery from substance use aggregating multiple instruments and domains of
    substance health. It will be developed into a graphical interface that communicates

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel
    approaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel
    dressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically
    from other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as
    it is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial
    properties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery
    therapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are
    intermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.
    Successfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the
    serious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with
    chronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related
    costs of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.
    The proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and
    processing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.
    The dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal
    chronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be
    explored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate
    commercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for
    wound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings
    will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to improve the ability to amplify very long DNA in a few hours with high precision and few errors. The polymerase chain reaction amplification technology invented 30 years ago has revolutionized biomedical sciences. The proposed 100 kilobase (Kb) DNA amplification technology is ten times longer than existing methods, which would enable multiple technical and commercial capabilities not currently possible. These new tools will improve human health via high resolution sequence analysis of cancer genomes, safer DNA therapeutic applications, more rapid natural product drug discovery, and simplified genome engineering for stem cell biology research. Furthermore, this technology has the potential to revolutionize scientific and commercial fields such as oncology, transplantation, microbiology, gene therapy, synthetic biology, drug discovery, and basic molecular and cellular biology. The economic impact of the proposed research in the form of marketable products and services also is substantial. It is estimated that the patent protectable 100 kb DNA amplification technologies and applications could generate over $1B in revenues over the 20-year life span of the various products in four markets:  Amplification, sequencing, gene therapy, and synthetic biology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop 100 kb DNA amplification tools that dramatically overcome the commercial and technical limits of current in vitro DNA amplification products. Complex problems in biomedical sciences remain prohibitively costly, time-consuming, and laborious due to long-range sequence information that is lost or scrambled using existing short-range amplification tools. Research products that can amplify anonymous and sequence-specific DNA in long contiguous stretches approaching 100 Kb are needed for improvements in sequence analysis, cloning, mapping, transfection, expression, and related biotechnology applications. The research goal is to develop novel enzymatic approaches to amplify long stretches of DNA utilizing a native consortium of high fidelity replication enzymes, as opposed to single enzyme systems. The plan is to build on existing resources that have proven superior for the replication of long DNA, however, using new methods that dramatically reduce the side reactions and problems inherent with single enzyme systems. A scientific renaissance surrounding long-range amplification and sequencing methods is envisioned that radically simplifies the sequencing and assembly of cancer genome rearrangements, engineering large, complex metabolic pathways encoding drugs, and producing long tracts of vector- and virus-free DNA for gene therapy and stem cell induction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will apply the novel nanotechnology
    to the problem of pneumonia and sepsis.  Pneumonia is the second worldwide cause of death and first among children under 5 years old, and is the number one cause of sepsis. The mainstay
    of treatment is empiric antibiotic selection, which increases multidrug resistant organisms
    and may not appropriately address the cause of the infection, thus potentially increasing
    mortality. The broader impact of diagnosing the cause of pneumonia at the bedside or in the field within 10 minutes with no need for a central laboratory will produce a new paradigm and decrease patient mortality, cost, and multi-drug resistant organisms. The technology will move the field to a new era of screening high risk patients for pneumonia, before severe infection or sepsis occurs. The technology will also serve as the missing tool to greater understand the natural history and epidemiology of pneumonia, as the causative organism in pneumonia is only found in half of patients at present. The annual cost for pneumonia and sepsis in United States hospitals is $30 billion.

    The technology uses nanotechnology to greatly increase the surface area for nanoscale binding events that are measured with changes of impedance which are then correlated to a concentration of the target biomarker.  The technology will move the pneumonia field from the current qualitative result to a quantitative reading. The detection of common causes of pneumonia will be accomplished from a drop of blood, urine, and/or saliva. Synthetic solutions with pneumonia biomarkers will be constructed.  Analytical parameters including accuracy, precision, linearity, calibration, limit of blank, limit of detection, functional sensitivity, and interfering substances will be evaluated.  In addition, the optimum manufacturing process for a disposable sensor cartridge will be determined. This will include an assessment of dry versus wet biochemistry, appropriate manufacturing method, accuracy, calibration, storage, temperature, ageing, and final design concepts. The goal of the proposed research is to produce an alpha prototype of the sensor cartridge that can detect the pneumonia biomarkers from synthetic solutions of blood, urine, and saliva.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop and provide novel computation capabilities to the marketplace that mimic and apply the way our brain computes beyond deep learning systems and much closer to how the brain actually operates. Although
    the technology is initially targeted for the commercial drone market, the technology can be applied to consumer and hobbyist drone market, self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous navigation and guiding systems with obstacle avoidance for
    robots, ballistics tracking and counter-drone capabilities for military and defense, and surveillance and counter-drone for public safety and security. This project has the potential to revolutionize robotic and machine vision by providing capabilities that simply do not exist today.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates novel ways, algorithms and software implementations that leverage expertise in natural vision systems, deep learning and machine learning to make use of electro-optical sensors, which
    respond in new ways to form the basis of an Airborne Based Sense and Avoid (ABSAA) system. It leverages the benefits of bio-inspired computation, and investigates how to combine information from multiple sensors in a common representation. The project will study novel ways to achieve robust detection, segmentation, clustering, discrimination and classification with these novel sensors. It will also extend methods and algorithms for state estimation, tracking and prediction in the inherent sensor representation. The project will also address the real-time constraints and will attempt to leverage recent hardware implementations, which can provide a complete embedded system for ABSAA system that is low SWaP (size, weight and power) and in the long run, low cost as well because it has the potential to benefit from economy of scale. The theoretical and algorithmic advances generated by the project have the potential to affect
    machine and robotic vision well beyond the project focused application to ABSAA.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a novel compact cell settler that
    can selectively remove dead cells and cell debris from the cell culture broth
    and completely recycle all the live and productive cells back to the continuous
    perfusion bioreactor.  As this membrane-free device is not prone to clogging like
    the competing membrane-based cell retention devices, a single perfusion bioreactor
    culture does not need to be terminated prematurely after 3 or 4 weeks (due to
    accumulation of dead cells and cell debris resulting in reduced product quality
    and clogged membranes in current devices).  The novel compact cell settler has
    a small size and footprint compared with other cell retention devices, and increases
    the likelihood of wider adaptation of the technology by a larger number of biomanufacturing
    companies and reduces the cost of manufacture of therapeutic biologics.  As biosimilar
    price competition is expected for successful products that are coming off patent
    protection,  reducing the cost of their manufacture using superior cell culture
    techniques will enable increased affordability of these drugs to a wider patient
    population. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel compact
    and more efficient method of scaling up inclined settler technology, which has
    been scaled up inefficiently as rectilinear lamellar settlers.  While a few biological
    manufacturers have successfully adapted the protruding lamellar settlers to manufacture
    therapeutic biologics from recombinant mammalian cells in high cell density perfusion
    bioreactors, the proposed novel compact cell settler is predicted to achieve the
    required separation of dead cells and cell debris from a high cell density perfusion
    bioreactor with a much smaller footprint compared to the original inclined lamellar
    settler design. Three key objectives for the research are to 1) demonstrate that
    the novel compact cell settler can achieve and maintain high viable cell densities
    indefinitely, 2) determine the maximum perfusion rate that maintain the high viable
    cell density indefinitely for smaller settlers of two different sizes, and 3)
    develop new scaling laws that can predict the size requirements of the settlers
    for larger commercial-scale bioreactors.  These objectives will be accomplished
    by a systematic experimental plan to investigate the performance of the novel
    settlers at two different sizes and for two different mammalian cell types."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on an automated painting and overspray capture system is a significant increase in the health/safety of construction workers and profitability/production efficiency of the construction industry. Painting workers suffer from increased short and long term health problems due to exposure to paint fumes, including increased potential for certain cancers and cognitive damage. Construction projects are delayed due to injuries, lack of available skilled labor, and prohibitive costs. A system that can eliminate major health and safety risks by capturing harmful fumes as well as increase productivity by autonomously working alongside skilled workers will have a significant positive impact on the construction industry and workers. This innovation could open the construction industry up to myriads of intelligent, autonomous solutions that improve health, safety, quality, and production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will work to establishing the technical and commercial feasibility of an automated system to paint and capture overspray. The SBIR project will focus on the device responsible for directing paint from the spraying apparatus to the surface to be painted and containment of overspray and harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The health hazards of paint fumes and airborne VOCs are apparent through the increased risk of certain cancers and long-term cognitive damage suffered by painters. Additionally, painting at heights on ladders or other lift equipment presents a safety and efficiency problem. The research objectives of this SBIR are to develop a system that can effectively contain overspray/paint fumes while being small/lightweight enough for use by a robotic platform. Extensive flow analysis will be conducted with experimental geometry and flow visualization techniques on benchtop test rigs to evaluate geometry and flow characteristics. Successful benchtop test designs will be further tested on a robotic platform to evaluate system-level performance for paint quality, over spray containment, and airborne VOCs.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a web-based application that assists prospective and new college students in the challenging decision of the major/minor choice for their college degree. Studies have shown that 20 to 50 percent of students enter college as undecided in terms of intended majors, and subsequently an astonishing 75 percent actually change their major at least once before graduation. These statistics illustrate one of the key factors that hinder on-time degree completion and boost total student debt to the trillion dollar level. The proposed system administers a brief but highly-regarded personality quiz, then displays majors and minors that align with the results of that quiz. The student makes selections from this list, then clicks a button to see groups of corresponding semester-by-semester shortest-path degree plans with labels indicating their alignment with the personality quiz result. This easy-to-use approach empowers students to make early, well-informed college career choices. Colleges across the country will want to purchase and install this software for many reasons, including: to show their commitment to helping students avoid the all-too-common difficulties and expense of poor college career decisions, to obtain improved graduation rates, and to improve administrative resource planning for future semesters via a database of their students' plans.

    The key technical innovations of this software system include integration of a personality interest assessment profile within a degree planning system, assignment of interest vectors to individual college courses along with the utilization of this information in the development of degree plans that are well-aligned with student interest vectors, the use of state-of-the-art mathematical optimization techniques in order to quickly generate shortest-path degree plans, and automated multiple-plan generation followed by clustering and cluster labeling within this plan collection in order to provide a simple interface that allows a student to easily navigate through a collection of alternative degree plans. These technical innovations are made possible by the many years of experience in algorithm development by the company team members, and represent an approach not seen in the very limited collection of existing academic planning software, which tends to focus on cumbersome drag-and-drop technology that discourages the exploration of alternative degree paths. The goal of this research is to provide an easy-to-customize and easy-to-install degree planning system that will be readily affordable by any academic institution and that will allow prospective and undecided students to discover and explore in detail - with just a few mouse clicks - those college careers that are aligned with their personal interests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) will be to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms.  These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, helping in the movement to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given.  Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas and deliver substances to live animals or humans.  In addition, the proposed system will lead to increased productivity, allowing the poultry industry to meet the world's growing nutritional needs.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes the development of technologies for screening and vaccinating live animals.  This proposal brings innovation to the care of food animals allowing producers to move away from flock health, focusing instead on the care of individual animals.  Individualized care is not practiced due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large-scale commercial hatchery operation.  The overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a system that safely and effectively processes 100,000 chicks per hour, preform health checks and target recognition, and delivers a vaccine to individual chicks.  This specific SBIR project will focus on two main goals:  1) Development of an automated system to determine the health status of a day-of-age chick.  The system will recognize unhealthy chicks and target them for removal.  2) Development of a targeting system to determine the position of a chick using key features and provide the system?s master controller with the coordinates for proper delivery of vaccines and/or biologicals to the correct location on the chick.  Achieving these objectives will allow for further development of the product, adding in multiple lines for processing, leading to a fully commercial product.

    This STTR Phase I project is to develop a web-based platform that enables students to quickly create and share educational games that can be based on a wide variety of subject matter, including STEM subject matter. This end result of this project will be a responsive web application that enables students to create educational games using nothing more than an internet connection and a modern web browser. Designing a simulation is a pedagogically rich task, as it requires that students not only understand the concepts involved, but that they create a mental model in which the concepts form a coherent system. The promise of this platform is that it puts students in the role of a simulation designer, but without the need for the extensive technical knowledge, specialized software, or time commitment that creating a simulation game typically requires. The game mechanic of this platform is simple and flexible enough that it can be used to create learning games relevant to a large number of disciplines, and the authoring tools take only minutes to learn. It is this team's hope that this project will facilitate the creation of thousands of educational games that address subjects that no games have addressed before.

    This project is innovative on several fronts, and collectively these innovations will enable the platform to expand what is possible in educational gaming and research on serious games. This platform is accessible to anyone in the world through a modern web browser, no plugins required. The platform also provides an extremely intuitive authoring environment that allows students to easily create powerful simulations, regardless of their technical expertise. The platform's simulation game mechanic can be adapted to a wide variety of subject matter; it is not designed around any specific field. Every game a student creates is given a unique URL that they can share with their teacher, their peers, or whomever else they choose. The platform also provides an easily searchable catalog of the games that have been created and shared by others throughout the world. The goal of this project is to successfully develop a prototype of the platform, and to then evaluate the technical feasibility, usability, and commercial feasibility of the prototype. This will be evaluated with a combination of usability tests, surveys, interviews, and quantitative data gathered with analytics software and other tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be seen in the adoption of solar energy as a cost-competitive alternative to non-renewable energy sources. While solar energy costs have been dramatically reduced, the use of the most efficient cells is limited by manufacturing costs. The need for efficient cells - solar cells that deliver more watts per area - can be seen when considering system costs. Higher efficiency reduces all costs related to area: module components, support structures, labor, land, etc. Silicon Heterojunctions (SHJ) cells deliver leading conversion efficiencies but are manufactured with processes that require multiple passes through very expensive machines to deposit required semiconductor layers. The manufacturing cost issue has hindered adoption of the high efficiency SHJ cell technology. The project's innovation dramatically reduces the cost of the most expensive steps in SHJ cell manufacture while maintaining or improving cell performance. Potentially, the innovation could find application in other markets such as organic light emitting diodes (LEDs). The cost reduction of the SHJ cell will significantly shift the photovoltaic industry's energy conversion efficiency upward and the cost per watt downward.

    The proposed project addresses two shortcomings of the established manufacturing methods for SHJ solar cells. The first challenge is the deposition of the cell's transparent conductive layer, typically an alloy called indium tin oxide (ITO). Standard sputter processes used for this deposition cause damage to the underlying layers of the cell. The damage can reduce the cell performance or require additional process steps. Also, next generation concepts for SHJ cell design are even more sensitive to damage and less able to tolerate "repair" steps. The project will develop a novel low damage sputter source for the ITO deposition. The second challenge is that the semiconductor layers of the SHJ cell use costly plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) systems developed for the high value display industry. The project will direct use of the novel sputter source for deposition of the semiconductor layers as well as the ITO. Sputter is lower cost than PECVD and easily allows sequential layers of different materials to be deposited in a single, continuous flow, in-line machine. The project will demonstrate the sputter source for each of the layers as separate materials and for an SHJ cell with a fully sputtered stack of the three critical layers.

    Research (SBIR) project is to harness the power of engineered gut microbes for
    treating disease through the development of tools for controlling their abundance

    that respond to gastrointestinal conditions to deliver new therapeutic activities
    to specific sites in the gut at the appropriate dose and time. This SBIR project
    will improve the reliability of these cell-based therapies by allowing for precise

    key to ensuring a consistent therapeutic effect across different patient diets
    and microbiomes. Engineered bacteria have been used to deliver anti-inflammatory

    IBD is a chronic disease with no cure and low response rates to current treatments,
    affecting 1.4 million Americans at an annual cost of $6.3 billion in the US alone.
    In addition to solving a critical remaining challenge in bringing this IBD therapy

    First, all genes that are suspected to be involved in growth on the control molecule
    will be systematically removed from a natural isolate to determine those that
    are required. Next, these genes will be transferred to a non-consuming strain
    to introduce the ability to grow on the control molecule. Finally, this newly
    engineered strain that was modified to grow on the control molecule will be introduced
    into mice that harbor a human microbiota, and the ability to get reliable colonization
    of these mice by feeding the mice the control molecule will be tested. This project

    This SBIR Phase I project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. The proposed innovation will advance state-of-the-art by providing a continuous in-situ multi-analyte sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important culture analytes. The sensor array will have the unique ability to measure time dependent correlations between pH, osmolality, and concentrations of glucose, lactate and monoclonal antibodies. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing upstream biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of biologic drug cost of goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed is expected to reduce these costs up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the sensing molecules. Thus, the proposed technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or in medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality.

    This project will demonstrate the feasibility of adapting newly discovered affinity ligands for bioprocess sensing; thereby obtaining the first in-situ biosensor that can be used to monitor the concentration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) during manufacturing in real time. This biosensor will be based on a novel magnetically transduced stimuli-responsive hydrogel containing affinity ligands that target mAbs. This antibody sensor will be integrated into an existing in-situ bioreactor sensor array capable of monitoring other key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing. Product feasibility will be demonstrated via three objectives: 1) Synthesize a novel magnetically transduced stimuli-responsive hydrogel containing affinity ligands that specifically bind to mAbs. 2) Incorporate the hydrogel of objective 1 into a sensor suitable for monitoring the concentration of mAbs in cell culture media in the concentration range relevant to biomanufacturing. 3) Integrate the antibody sensor into an existing sensor array and demonstrate its performance under typical antibody manufacturing conditions. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus the proposed project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications.

    improve patient care.  Applications of the software include: a) the developing
    different software versions for different health care situations, the technology
    can be used to improve the patient experience in clinics, emergency departments,
    primary care settings, outpatient centers, etc.; b) Early interventions.  Healthcare
    leaders are asking for an early warning system.  By recording patient conversations
    with nurses and doctors while they are still in the hospital, this feedback can
    be used to identify and resolve problems before the patient is discharged; c)
    New health care delivery models.  One hospital wants to reduce the length of stay
    for heart patients; doctors want to be sure that patients are ready to go home.
    \ The software is analyzing the stories of heart patients who did well versus
    patients who had problems when they left the hospital early.  Their feedback will

    patient feedback during clinical trials.  The resulting information will make
    it easier to recruit and retain patients in clinical trials as well as improve
    clinical outcomes.  Ultimately, results from these analyses could be used to inform
    FDA decision making within the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nThe proposed project
    develops software that uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
    to analyze patients? responses about their health care experiences in interviews
    and open response survey questions in order to provide hospitals with concrete,
    actionable information on how to improve care and patient outcomes. To date, hospitals
    have relied primarily on surveys to inform their attempts to improve patient experiences.\nThis
    research will develop an NLP application for mining patient feedback across health
    care settings. Data where patients freely tell their \"stories\" provides a clearer
    and more precise view of the patient's experience than a standard survey with
    ratings on predefined questions. The challenge is that the variability of expression
    and experiences requires sophisticated techniques to be able to classify the information,
    determine the sentiment, and extract essential details that can provide actionable
    recommendations to hospitals. The team proposes a combination of data annotation,
    pattern matching, and machine learning techniques for classification and information
    extraction of core concepts like problem root causes from unstructured patient
    feedback. Since interviews comprise much of the most informative data, we will
    also evaluate which speech recognition technologies can best convert audio to
    text, for subsequent classification and information extraction."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will not only produce a multifunctional thermal insulation structure that is easy to install onto any existing single-, double-, or even triple-pane windows in reducing total building energy consumption, but also improve water condensation issues and occupant discomfort that are associated with single-pane windows in cool climates. Furthermore, the smart window system includes a soundproof layer that can attenuate noise, outperforming a triple-pane window without deterioration of optical properties. In cold climates, the film, which uses a low-e coating, will prove the exterior temperature condition (< -5 °C) required for interior condensation to occur in winter. The proposed approach outperforms existing doubleor triple-pane windows with Al frames and conventional spacers and will enjoy a share of the already-popular energy saving windows market (61.6%, or ~$10 billion Global). According to our cost estimate for a 1 square foot smart window of the design dimension proposed (including all chemical and energy costs in a scalable roll-to-roll process), a $5/ft2 manufacturing cost can be achieved, providing a great incentive with a pay-off period within 5 years for customers.

    The proposed project will address thermal, optical, and acoustic concerns on an existing singlepane window simultaneously. The thin window film realizes a low U-factor (&#8804; 0.45) within 3mm in thickness, through the combination of a super-low thermal conductive supporting material, and two distinct coatings (low transmittance in infrared region) on a thin film, which can be readily attached to a single-pane glass window. It also yields noise attenuation &#8805; 50 dB with designed cavities embedded in the window film to attenuate noise transmission. The resulting sheet can not only enhance acoustic insulation performance but also reduce the volume of the porous membrane used and thus cost. In addition, the smart film demonstrates all-season operation of smart-glass based on temperature-responsive, tunable Near-IR transmittance in a tunable thermochromic coating without electric power consumption. The film controls haze by Page 11 controlling light scattering in the interface of granulate materials and reduces the volume fraction of the structural material used in the proposed smart film. The combined low-e and thermochromic coatings will help the film achieve a high color rendering index because visible transmittances for the coatings are excellent complements to each other, thus exhibiting a broad and uniform transmission over the visible spectrum.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable flexible carrier aggregation in mobile wireless networks using frequency-translational quadrature-hybrid (FTQH) technology. The customer demand for wireless connectivity keeps increasing both in terms of more connected devices and higher data rates. Carrier aggregation is a critical technology to further increase data rates for next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks. It lets mobile network operators and neutral hosts make more effective use of their fragmented spectral resources. Mobile communications are now an essential part of our personal and professional lives and impact all aspects of our society from business, to government, to education and the non-profit sector. The small business concern will generate OEM RF front-end products for the small-cell base station market which is growing rapidly with more than 10 million small-cell base station shipments estimated in 2020. This will strengthen the US commercial technology base and generate US employment opportunities as it grows its workforce.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the FTQH technology. This technology promises to enable the design of modular, flexible RF front ends for small-cell base stations. FTQH is a novel architectural approach that leverages existing RF filtering, RF switching and RF routing technologies while enabling low cost, high performance, modular RF front ends for flexible carrier aggregation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans various segments i.e. consumer, environment
    monitoring, healthcare, infrastructure monitoring, automotive, smart cities, agriculture, power generation,
    oil and gas, industrial automation/manufacturing, retail, and robotics to name a few. Over the past several
    decades, wireless connectivity has played a significant role in reshaping our social lives and generating
    huge economic value for businesses all around the globe. The wireless connectivity has been focused
    around human-to-human communication but in the next decade machine-to-machine communication will
    play a significant role in the fourth industrial revolution. The proposed R&D will enable the vision of
    ubiquitous connectivity at scale, which the Internet of Things promises. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    economic impact is projected to be anywhere between $7-15 trillion globally in the next decade and the
    impact of it will be felt by virtually every industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the two key problems with the
    current state-of-the-art wireless sensor nodes. First is the limited battery-life and second is the cost of the
    sensor nodes. Low power standard compliant wireless communication plays a key role in extending the
    battery-life of a wireless sensor node. Experience with semiconductors dictates that complete system
    integration on a single piece of silicon (zero external components) not only reduces the cost of the system
    (in high volume) but also improves the systems? overall energy efficiency. This enables operation on
    harvested energy requiring no external battery. No external components imply that the microsystem needs
    to operate from energy sources with limited capacity. No external components also imply no quartz crystal
    frequency reference, which almost every microsystem uses as of today for frequency and timing reference.
    Off-chip crystal is a bulky component that poses a severe size limitation for low-profile millimeter scale
    microsystems. Eliminating off-chip crystal is a significant step forward towards energy autonomous
    millimetre-scale microsystems that have widespread commercial applications.

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to create a human to machine language tool that allows anything from the simplest shape to the most complex engineering design to be fabricated anywhere that a robotic fabrication machine and the necessary raw materials exist. At a high level many parts are created today customized to a specific users need and a small handful of humans have the knowhow and access to machines to create such customized parts on their own. The complexity of this can be mitigated by creating tools for translation of information from people?s ideas to machine output with much less error and cost. By creating a means to simplify the process of getting from idea to customized fabricated parts, the proposed tool can help achieve balance between creativity and production more easily for Maker Manufacturing. Upon successfully deploying a uniformed solution to the overly complex mesh of fabrication processes used today, hundreds of thousands of new machines can be employed at any end point by interchangeable people to bring to bear goods at any level of precision needed. The end goal is creation of a portal and toolset for fabricators to take and fulfill small batch manufacturing of parts. Success will mean that hundreds to thousands of times more people will be able to create tangible goods from ideas and concept combinations.


    This is a project to unify CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) across all digital fabrication tools and reduce the complexity of machining designs. While 3D printing may bring an idea of simplicity and access to everyone, laser cutting, CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled or Robotic), injection molding, vacuum forming, and other tools of mass production can likewise also be made more accessible. The project is a software tool embodying a single process for which any design can start at one end and any machine be placed at the other end. At least in showing how much of the same end result, if any, each machine is capable of producing of the intended output. This project will produce a part plus material algorithm by which any part that can be fabricated can be proposed to the algorithm and all of the machines capable of producing them can be identified. From there the scale - both in size of part and number - of copies of the part can be added in and thus sort the machines by best part quality, price, and overall speed of production at any volume. The goal of the research is to capture all existing manufacturing practices in machine shops and Maker places, and assure that none of today?s capabilities are lost while creating a living algorithm that allows for future capabilities to be added to any fabrication process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-Level inverter, an integrated 48kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy.  The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault-tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    increase in the efficiency and reliability of the power grid, which would result
    in lower electricity rates to consumers and facilitate the integration of renewable
    energy into the grid. This project will enable the use of topology optimization
    in the operation of the power transmission grid and allow operators to adapt the
    grid configuration to address changes in system conditions in real time. These
    adaptive reconfigurations increase the ability of the system to transfer power
    across the network in the directions that matter for economic, reliability, or
    environmental reasons. The economic benefits of topology optimization represent
    a 50% reduction in the cost of grid congestion, which translates to $1-4 billion/year
    production cost savings in the US. In addition, topology optimization would consistently
    reduce, or entirely remove, the otherwise frequent overloads on transmission facilities,
    thereby increasing the reliability of the grid. Topology optimization would also
    facilitate grid operations with large amounts of variable renewable resources,
    such as wind and solar, by relieving their curtailment by about 40%. Given the
    increase in renewable energy in the generation mix, topology optimization is expected
    to become even more effective and important in the future. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop fast and adaptive power
    system model reduction software fully integrated with topology optimization software.
    The technical challenge arises from the fact that finding a power flow solution
    for a large full nodal model of a power system requires the model to be reduced
    to an equivalent smaller model, to avoid numerical issues with the full model.
    For typical analyses, this reduction only needs to be performed once; however,
    for topology optimization, in the course of finding a good topology configuration,
    hundreds of different topologies need to be analyzed. Thus, the main technical
    hurdle preventing topology optimization from being used in online operations decision-support
    is the current state-of-the-art model reduction computation speed. As such, this
    project?s objective is to lower the computation time of the model reduction component
    by at least 10 times compared to existing capabilities in commercial software,
    when used as part of topology optimization routines. Model reduction calculations
    will be designed to take advantage of problem-specific attributes of the topology
    optimization routine, which will enable reduced computation time, by, for example,
    making use of partial recalculations and decomposition of the problem to support

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address the ability to use automation to harvest strawberries in the United States in an environment where migrant labor is scarce and the work is undesirable. The project is borrowing techniques and methods that have been used and refined in many other high volume manufacturing/production industries and applying the applicable ideas to harvesting food crops with automated machines. Big data methods are also being developed in conjunction with the acquisition techniques that will assist crop growing with predictive information about future yields and help with monitoring plant health in relation to disease and pest infestation. The business model being developed helps the adoption of the technology into the farming community by not requiring the farmers to have large capital outlays by providing the anticipated machines to the farmers as a service to replace their labor. The initiation of the service will therefore be an easy decision for a farmer to make and will be helpful in establishing the standard for future harvesting models and techniques.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing techniques and ideas to be able to accomplish the robotic harvesting of some of the most labor intensive and delicate fruit. Special machine vision techniques are being utilized to be able to simultaneously detect, decipher and target the fruit at a speeds conducive to commercial harvesting. Also, unique machine techniques that will enable the harvesting of the fruit without bruising. Objectives include experimenting with ideas that will lead to more consistent fruit packing and techniques to increase fruit shelf life after picking. Most prior research in these areas focused on being able to pick the fruit with machines and not so much on the ability to do it at commercial speeds. The entire purpose of the systems of the Harvest CROO is to rapidly acquire the fruit under the plants and then be able to pack and carry it out of the fields. Many of the projects until this point had no allotment for removing the fruit from the fields. The Harvest CROO system will establish standards for this.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the reduction
    in the cost of renewable energy. The dramatic decline in the cost of wind energy
    over the last several decades has been fueled by the ever increasing turbine size
    and the introduction of new manufacturing methods and materials. However, the
    industry is approaching the limits of this trend due to the increased wear and
    tear of the turbine blades and drive train, caused by unsteady aerodynamic forces.
    Turbine manufacturers have been studying and testing various approaches to mitigate
    unsteady aerodynamic loads, including independent blade pitch control, trailing
    edge flaps, microtabs, boundary layer blowing, and mechanical camber control.
    Each of these potential solutions is costly, complex, and requires moving parts.
    As a result, none has moved beyond the prototype stage. The new active load-control
    system, based on plasma actuators, has the potential to leap-frog all other solutions.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
    the feasibility of countering unsteady aerodynamic forces in utility-scale wind
    turbines by controlling the air flow around the blades with blade-mounted plasma
    actuators. This fully electronic flow control device will mitigate aerodynamic
    loads and enable the deployment of larger, more efficient and more durable turbines.
    Leveraging recent improvement in plasma actuator technology, with a ten-fold increase
    in thrust, and with one-tenth of the power consumption, a new innovative actuator
    will be designed, built and tested with 2-4X performance improvement over the

    unsteady aerodynamic forces in large wind turbines with blade tip speeds of up
    to 200 miles/hour."

    This Phase I project will determine the efficacy of cutting-edge digital technologies for language acquisition by non-native English speakers.  In particular, the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking students learn more effectively when given native-language educational tools will be tested.  As they progress through the study, students will transition from Spanish-only to bilingual or English-only instruction appropriate to their level of attainment, using award-winning digital platforms and learning tools.  Research suggests that technologies that leverage native language ability to calibrate achievement are more effective than English-only instruction.  However, current methods are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. As a consequence, more than 40% of today's non-native speakers drop out of school.  Students who learn English fluently have been shown to excel in all academic areas and, therefore, become fuller participants in American civil society.  If successful, this project will enhance an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use in schools nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation's mission.

    Existing products in educational software offer limited comprehensible input - basic instruction in non-English languages - and typically do not employ best practices for the transference of Spanish language ability to English learning programs.  This project proposes to employ an existing language-acquisition platform, combined with a set of Spanish-language and bilingual language scaffolding tools, to determine the most effective practices for English learning.  Researchers will conduct a six-month pilot project in one or several Southern California public school districts, and success will be measured by the Bateria en Español and Woodcock Language Proficiency Tests. The project will leverage this platform to determine the optimal combination of language tools (sentence frames) and the best timeframe for transitioning instruction from Spanish to English (from Level 1 to Level 2 instruction).  The project will employ best-practice techniques according to the Shelter Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) and the Bilingual Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (BCIRC) standards.  Results will be both qualitative and quantitative, and study results will be assessed using standard measures of statistical significance.  The research team will be headed by a long-time educator and an educational software developer, and both leads are well qualified to conduct research of this type.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to increase access to and compliance with cardiac rehabilitation program and reduce the cost of avoidable hospital readmission, both by predicting which cardiac patients are at risk and by providing patients with simple but accurate guidance, allowing them to precisely control exercise intensity and volume during rehabilitation. It also has the potential to reduce the mortality rates of cardiac patients and provide doctors with a large amount of accurate information on the relationship between exercise duration, exercise intensity, and changes in cardiac patient conditions during recovery, supporting optimal design of rehabilitation program design. The key idea enabling these outcomes is using wearable sensors to measure the mechanical power outputs of cardiac patients and using these power measurements to estimate an established high-quality predictor for cardiac patient hospital readmission and mortality rates. The size of the market is substantial, with roughly one million Americans suffering from heart attacks per year.

    The proposed project will determine whether total body mechanical power output can be used to predict metabolic energy expenditure, using a ground truth based on volume of oxygen consumption per unit time. This metric, VO2 is a heavily used indicator of cardiac health for patients who have experienced heart attacks. Ambulatory mechanical power output has been used by athletes to track and provide feedback on physical condition, but it remains unclear whether similar applications are feasible for cardiac patients, due to their differing physical conditions and sensor use preferences. In addition to validating the use of mechanical power to estimate VO2 the project will also evaluate different sensor use and wearability conditions appropriate for cardiac patients, and make innovations in signal processing algorithm, sensor design, and usability required by these conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to create a user-friendly, universal control
    system for robots and sensors that for the first time would make it possible for nontechnical service
    industry professionals to task and control co-robots deployed in their facility. This simplification of
    software for an end-user will make systems of robots as easy to control as a single robot. Data collected
    over the lifecycle of the robots and sensors (which is currently not done) may aid in identification of new
    technologies to revolutionize system capabilities in the field of robotics. Although this concept could be
    applied to a wide array of service sector industries, SRT proposes to efficiently integrate and
    cooperatively control a fleet of robots and sensors to support custodial service industry tasks, because?
    though essential?custodial services add no commercial value to an organization. Thus the sector is
    clamoring for ways to reduce personnel turnover and other costs. In the U.S., custodial services are a $40
    billion industry; a mere 5% increase in efficiency would result in $2 billion in savings annually. This
    sector is rife with robots from disparate manufacturers, yet facility managers need an easy-to-use method
    to ?employ? multiple, specialized robots.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a common software
    architecture that will serve as a universal receptor for service robotics systems. The predominant technical
    hurdle is effectively combining the software protocols and coordinating control of the robots. There
    currently is no common standard for robotics software systems. The actual robot (the hardware) is
    typically the primary focus for product developers, while the software is built from a variety of
    proprietary, heritage and open sources, and is as unique as the company developing it. Little or no
    consideration is given to how robots from different manufacturers could interact in the real world. By
    standardizing the data protocols for robots and smart devices, and making that openly available, SRT
    intends to drive future open API development for hardware. Standardized APIs will still protect the
    proprietary components, but will quickly allow for data sharing across multiple devices?facilitating
    research in robotics, machine learning, and big data?by allowing end-users to quickly integrate multiple
    components into the same system, and develop their own algorithms to utilize the shared data streams.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to eliminate the need for costly trial and error in the fabrication of specialty optical fibers. Specialty fibers are rapidly finding applications in a diverse array of fields, resulting in a rapidly growing market for this technology. However, a major bottleneck in their development is the difficulty of fabricating them, since the configuration of the fiber may differ from the preform from which it is drawn. The new technology will provide value in significantly reducing costs in materials and labor associated with existing trial and error procedures by providing a tool capable of predicting in advance the preform configuration and parameters necessary to draw a desired fiber. Besides enhancing scientific understanding of the physics of fiber drawing, the development of this tool would allow more rapid exploration of the possibilities offered by specialty optical fibers.

    The proposed project would lay the mathematical groundwork necessary to develop prediction software for specialty optical fibers. By developing a mathematical model of the fluid dynamics of fiber drawing that incorporates both air channels and inclusions of viscous fluid, it would be applicable to a wide range of specialty optical fibers being developed today, including multicore fibers. The proposed project would additionally attempt to overcome previous efforts' restrictions on the slenderness of the draw-down region. Because the model will be specialized to the geometry of fiber drawing, an implementation will run fast enough for fabricators to explore a large space of possible parameters, allowing them to realize their fiber designs precisely. The model will be tested against numerical simulations of viscous threads and against experimental data. A successful outcome of the proposed project will be the development of methods that are accurate, fast enough for optimization work, and require only parameters that can be easily measured in draw towers. Implementing these methods in software will provide a crucial tool for fabricators in this rapidly expanding market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the possibility to revolutionize the treatment of cancer through more sensitive and specific cancer biomarker detection. 1.66 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer in 2014 alone, of which 585,720 died.  The sum of all health care costs in 2011 for cancer in the US was $88.7 billion.  A low cost, less invasive, and more sensitive detector will allow earlier detection of cancer and thus lower the cost of treatment and increase survival rates.  Higher sensitivity cancer detection will lead to early detection, enable targeted treatment, and save money and lives while improving quality of life.  In addition, the knowledge learned from this grant can be applied to other sensors in which the nanowires are functionalized for detection of materials.  These sensors could include sensors to support the Internet of Things, pollution monitoring, and ensuring high water quality.

    The proposed project will advance our knowledge of using nanowires as detectors. Nanowire sensors have a high surface area-to-volume ratio.  Thus their detection limit is dramatically lowered and their sensitivity is increased relative to non-nanostructured sensors.  This improvement is necessary for many biological assays. Others have made nanowire sensors and demonstrated high sensitivity.  However, the fabrication techniques they use to make their sensors are expensive and slow.  Thus, they are only able to get 1-10 nanowires per sensor and manufacturing throughput is low.  This project will use a high-throughput and low-cost process, and that results in millions of nanowires per sensor.  The nanowires will increase the surface area by over a thousand times thus allowing for more sensitive detection.   Instead of using horizontal wires like the competition, the proposed sensor uses arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.  The device design solves the typical challenges of contacting large arrays of nanowires and enables the measurement of both optical and electrical signals simultaneously.  The proposed project will measure a commercially relevant biomarker for lung cancer.  In addition, the investigators will detect two biomarkers on the same chip, thus demonstrating how the technology can be used to test multiple biomarkers on the same chip.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a low-cost satellite network for Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.   The proposed global communications network is orders of magnitude lower cost relative to existing options, and provides coverage at any location on the Earth.   Scientific, shipping, tracking, automotive, agriculture, energy, medical, educational, and other commercial entities will have the ability to return their data from anywhere on the planet to support tracking, safe operations, and optimal and timely decision making.  This innovative network is also expected to enable new market segments due to its unprecedented capability and cost. Further impact with the introduction of very small satellite design for swarm networking includes making space more accessible and promotes the use of smaller spacecraft resources for more complex missions. This enables the development of new products and services for data collection and return for scientific, societal, or commercial benefit.  Educational and research and development projects will also benefit with reduced barriers of entry to test new concepts and business models, making additional professional development opportunities available.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that there are no existing low-cost options for sensing, transmitting, and connecting devices from remote locations with no cell or Wifi coverage.  Existing solutions like Iridium are expensive and not utilized by the majority of markets requiring connectivity.  Swarm Technologies has developed smart, low-mass, low-power, low-cost (<1/10,000 the mass and power, and 1/400th the cost) integrated sensor and data relay platforms.  This creates the unique opportunity to develop low-cost space and ground based communication networks for global sensing, connectivity, and data return.  The long-term goal of this R&D project is to become a unique and true IoT enabler by creating an open access global space telecommunications network capable of relaying data from any space or ground IoT sensor anywhere on the planet. The research objectives of this proposal are to design and test the operational performance of the ground BEEs (the ground-relay nodes), including developing and characterizing the networking, communication, software, energy management systems.  We will utilize design, simulation techniques, and lab and environmental testing in representative environments (e.g. vacuum chamber and high altitude balloons).

    This SBIR Phase I project will provide an interactive learning environment for educational sketching which is critical in many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Sketching is an integral part of education from elementary school arithmetic to high school physics, and is used in professions ranging from medicine to engineering. Sketching is part of spatial visualization training, which has been shown to increase graduation rates, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. Until now, sketching assignments have been done with pencil and paper. This project will bring sketching assignments to touchscreens on tablets and computers. The algorithm developed will provide students with real-time feedback based upon their preliminary attempts, and teachers will be able to see exactly where students are having difficulty. A unique advantage of this approach is that it tracks student persistence and rewards students who stick with a sketching assignment until completed correctly. This is an advantage over most online education that relies on multiple-choice questions, which can only be attempted once. The project will initially focus on spatial visualization training for college engineering students, but ultimately will extend throughout STEM and be adapted for K-12. The increase in retention of students in STEM will aid in meeting the national targets to support economic growth.

    The software developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide feedback similar to an expert teacher. When a student makes an error, personalized hints are generated. By providing incremental help and rewarding students when they try on their own, student persistence is encouraged. The sketching will be performed on touchscreens, and the software will be compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, Chrome, and Linux operating systems. There are significant challenges with grading sketches, especially when compared to multiple-choice questions. If the grading algorithm is too lenient or too strict, students will lose confidence in the software. The grading algorithm will consider the sketched image, the difficulty of the assignment, and will utilize sketching data from early trials for fine-tuning purposes. Personalized assignments that gradually increase in difficulty as needed, as well as interactive 3D graphics and animations will be provided. A teacher interface will be developed that shows each student's progress down to the detail of each sketch attempt. Additionally, a metric will be developed to quantify student persistence based upon reliance on hints in order to identify which students need more individual mentoring. The scope of this project is the development of the grading algorithm, user interface, assignment and tutorial content, and teacher interface.

    Broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is summarized as follows. (1) Social impact: Transportation is the bloodstream of this nation with its level of importance being second to water. This country?s roadways are public use and the PI?s proposed technology is aimed at maintaining a fair and unbiased information infrastructure that satisfies the needs of both automotive and government agencies to fulfill their roles in public use and safety. (2) Commercial impact: The ability for vehicles to identify roadside regulations and guidance will provide several beneficial factors that will help alleviate driver distraction while aiding in additional cognitive awareness and safety. Additionally, wireless capable road signs can provide additional resources than their static counterparts that will make them more attractive and cost effective to their responsible entity/agency. (3) Technical impact: The project pushes the abilities of ultra low powered devices to extend the idea of location services, thus location dependent information is stored at its source producing almost instantaneous availability.

    The proposed project is working on further advancing and refining a small electronic device with wireless capabilities known as a roadside unit to meet the regulations of the United States Sign Council (USSC) motorist reaction distance for visual street cues to facilitate safe vehicle responses. Satisfying this requirement involves a novel communication protocol structured around efficient message transmission at ultra-low operating power to quickly detect and respond to moving vehicles with minimal energy usage. The projects communication protocol is designed to use minimal power while maximizing the amount of data throughput to ensure an operational lifespan of a battery powered device for a minimum of 10 years while achieving significant transmission distance. Because roadside infrastructure is standardized there is an opportunity for advanced data management techniques to simplify data transmission and decoding. The proposed system integrates and enhances the current vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication platform by offering another layer of sophisticated physical object identification. As vehicles take on autonomous responsibilities, they?ll need reliable, accurate, and authenticatable information about their surroundings with enough notice to facilitate safe responses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a disruptive change to the solar energy industry by potentially doubling the efficiency of the best available solar cells while, at the same time, significantly reducing their cost. Renewable energy sources are critical to energy independence and, importantly, to the long-term viability of human society which is faced with the inevitable depletion of hydrocarbon based energy sources, such as oil, gas, and coal.

    The proposed project leverages known technologies that are used in physics research, specifically in high energy physics accelerators, such as those found in Fermi National Accelerator Lab or at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The approach is based on using thermo-ionic emission from metals as the source of electric power, in contrast to existing technologies that only use photo-generated currents from more expensive semiconductors. This shift can provide not only higher efficiency, but also a shorter "return-on-energy" which is defined as the time it takes for the device to produce as much energy as was used in its production. The project goal is to demonstrate this new approach by producing a cell that can produce electricity with high efficiency and be measured and evaluated independently by a standards laboratory to validate its result. From this starting point, device optimization and further development will provide a new competing approach to energy independence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the first technical advancement in the specialty metals industry (manufacturers of titanium and nickel) in more than 4 decades. Specialty metals are ubiquitous in our lives, with applications from aircraft parts to medical implants, yet the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process, the work horse for this industry, has remained relatively unchanged since its development in the 1940?s. By coupling the ability to measure the location of electric arcs used for melting these high value alloys in the VAR, with the ability to steer the arcs, substantial electrical savings can be achieved, decreasing costs to the consumer and increasing reliability of the final products. For example, it is well known that the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the process leads to an estimated 8% yield loss, costing the US industry $1.024B per year in lost revenue through yield loss and electrical inefficiency, contributing to the high price of these products. This project proposes to decrease this loss by 50% by developing an applied feedback control technology capable of optimizing the energy distribution within these systems, providing better quality metals at a cheaper production price.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to prove that real-time control can improve plasma-based industrial processing systems. The innovation uses externally applied magnetic fields to manipulate arc position modes during melting operations. By coupling arc position sensing, which measures magnetic field vectors exterior to the process to determine arc positions interior to it, with active manipulation of externally derived fields, arcs can be precisely controlled. Relying upon years of development and validation of arc position sensing, coupled with Finite Element Analysis simulations and experimental validation, this technology will become the first active control of arc melting systems. The significant realization is that spatial and temporal control of the diffuse current paths can be controlled precisely if the validated measurement system of current location is coupled with external field generators. This effort will focus on the application to VAR furnaces but may have significant application to other processes with diffuse current pathways such as Joule heated systems, fuel cells, additive manufacturing or industrial microwave processing. The expected impact of arc control during melting is a reduction in manufacturing defects, an enablement of the production of ingots with increasing diameter, a reduction in energy required in alloy production, and improved safety of operations.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a Virtual Reality (VR)-based multiplayer game in which high school-aged players must collaboratively think through and solve complex, authentic Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM)-based problems. The United States faces a shortage of degreed STEM workers. More than half of high school students have indicated that they aren't pursuing STEM degrees or careers because they feel unprepared for or unaware of the opportunities available to them. Further, many students indicate they're interested in science and crave engaging, real-world experiences, but feel that they have limited authentic STEM opportunities in school. There is a need for experiences that engage students in authentic collaborative STEM thinking, and this project seeks to provide them with a compelling virtual problem space using VR. This project also seeks to provide educators with an accessible technology pathway to bring premium VR hardware into schools. Though VR has been heralded as a transformative technology, it currently faces expense and scalability hurdles for in-school use. By leveraging a mixture of technologies and role-based multiplayer, this project will create the virtual context to help players see problems as solvable through reason, experimentation, and collaboration - the heart of STEM philosophy. Players will work together, sharing their knowledge and expertise, running experiments, and solving difficult, compelling science problems.


    The core technical innovation of this project is the design and deployment methodology that will make premium Virtual Reality (VR) experiences a practical tool for schools. The project will result in a multiplayer experience in which one player uses the VR headset to act as the field agent, supported by 5-25 other students using traditional devices with role-based interfaces to act as mission control. By developing asymmetrical (but equally compelling) play experiences, the project will engage all students in collaborative Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) problem-solving. There are three main problems that this project must solve for educators: the hardware problem (VR hardware is expensive, difficult to scale to more than one student at a time, and requires installation and maintenance); the ambitious pedagogy problem (providing hands-on discovery and inquiry experiences that allow for meaningful collaboration and problem-solving); and the embodiment problem (students need to feel personally invested in the problems we devise if the experience is to be meaningful and transformational). The research goals are 1) To determine whether STEM-based scenarios can be generated with sufficient depth to engage a group of high school-age students in collaborative, interdisciplinary thought and problem-solving across both field agent and mission control roles; and 2) To determine whether the multiplayer role-play experiences produce significant improvements in STEM content knowledge and disposition among players. In order to measure these goals, multiple usability and feasibility tests will be conducted in authentic formal educational environments. Each test will be accompanied by a pre- and post-test that measures both content knowledge and disposition.

    to maintain or extend the structure service life. Various types of sealants have
    been used with an annual market value about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many
    sealants cannot properly seal cracks and joints, and/or last long, requiring frequent
    replacement or resealing. In this project, a smart sealant that expands upon cooling
    and contracts upon heating, which is thermally opposite to concrete, will be developed
    to counteract thermal movement of the joined structural elements. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project lies in the feasibility of a smart sealant technology. The
    primary reason for joint failure is that most sealants behave similar to concrete,
    i.e., they contract upon cooling and expand upon heating. This thermal behavior
    is contrary to the requirement for sealants. The objective of this project is
    to design, synthesize, characterize, and evaluate a cost-effective two-way shape
    memory polymer based sealant for sealing expansion joints or cracks in concrete
    pavement or bridge deck, which will expand upon cooling and contract upon heating.
    It will have the required mechanical properties and durability to survive the
    repeated traffic load and outdoor environment. The success of the project can
    have beneficial impact not only on the transportation infrastructure but also
    other structures such as driveways, parking lots, dams, harbors, buildings, swimming
    pools, etc."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its provision of a novel ranging capability whose quality, ease of placement, and scale in deployment will introduce new opportunities in robot operation in situations where there is uncertainty in the relative positions of parts and robots. These include small-batch production (where fixturing cannot be made cost effective), inspection and repair in confined spaces (where 3D sensing must be carried aboard the actuator), hazardous situations (where human presence incurs risk to life), and collaborative interaction with people (where inadvertent contact must be avoided). In the proposed development, robot grasp will be empowered with dynamic 3D range mapping at each fingertip, enabling direct computation of trajectories and velocities tailored to the geometry and structure about to be manipulated.  Extension of the technology to the larger challenge of 3D vision and object modeling offers economic impact in diverse applications.  These include autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle navigation (drones, cars), virtual reality and augmented reality interfaces, 3D teleconferencing and communication, cultural site modeling, and immersive cinema.  Each is an area where increases in reliability and precision with decreases in power and computational cost can bring an application over the threshold in price/performance, into viability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish a new level of real-time passive visual perception in near-range for robot operation, providing 3D data for accurate, precise and rapid grasp. Binocular imaging systems have not demonstrated success in near range robotics due to the inability of their match-based methods to deliver reliable depth measures in complex settings where disparity range is large. Current methods using a few cameras are based on matching so make mistakes, use search that is exponential in covered range so are expensive, and deliver parsimonious descriptions of the world (point clouds) so are weak in descriptive power.  All of these diminish the reliability of their processing and the utility of their analysis in real-world applications.  The technology of this project combined with recent wafer-level integration module packages overcomes these limitations through use of dense sampling, extended baselines, and maintaining and exploiting image spatial continuity. The technical challenge involves mechanical and electrical design to enable micro light-field ranging with analysis on an embedded processor, near-field calibration of imagers/optics/system, and coordination of these with robot control for assessing measurement accuracy and precision. The project will result in high-quality frame-rate light-field ranging on a robot fingertip.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide patients with a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device for the alleviation of postoperative ileus (POI) and the restoration of gastrointestinal motility. POI is an impairment of gastrointestinal motility that often develops following abdominal surgery and causes significant discomfort and comorbidities to both patients and their families. Existing solutions in the prevention or treatment of POI based on management strategies and pharmaceutical therapies have limited efficacy and are highly anecdotal. There is also no effective way for clinicians to quantitatively monitor the severity and resolution of POI.  The project is valuable and timely, and it represents a significant departure from the status quo. The success of this project would not only benefit the patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce the health care expenditure in the United States by shortening the hospitalization stay as well as the associated medical resources. The developed technologies can be further served as research tools for various biomedical applications to investigate underlying biological mechanisms and the feasibility study of novel treatment method for different diseases.

    The proposed project is to develop and demonstrate a wireless extra-luminal closed-loop gastrointestinal modulation device, capable of simultaneously neuromodulating the gastrointestinal tract and recording gastrointestinal motility wirelessly for alleviating POI, resulting in enhancing gastrointestinal motility.  POI costs over US $1.5 billion annually to its healthcare system. Safely shortening this length of stay by one day would produce significant dividends, leading to a market size of more than $700 million annually. The proposed project will address not only the design and optimization of a bioelectronic device, but also the integration and miniaturization of the wireless gastrointestinal therapeutic device. Animal study is to be conducted to validate the efficacy of the device in modulating and wirelessly recording of gastrointestinal motility, and its safety and reliability. If successful, the outcome will lead to a new bioelectronics medicine that advances the treatment of POI, and can be potentially expanded to other medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be observed through a direct reduction in the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings, campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will be significantly improved with the installation of PRC roofing material for building energy management. A complementary function of PRC roofing is found with the potential for enhanced condensation from the ultra-cool surface, presenting the ability to integrate PRC for improved rooftop water harvesting, directly impacting critical water supply issues and the expensive effects of drought on regional agriculture. The market demand for cool roofing materials has exceeded $750M, annually, and is expected to grow with recent energy regulations. PRC roofing material can expect to compete in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal management to facilities dedicated to condensation of atmospheric water vapor in isolated regions without access to satisfactory water supplies, and portable use for emergency water harvesting.

    The proposed project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage?relative to current commercial cool roofing materials?is expected to create significant long-term cost-savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled structures. PRC material properties designed to be selective across the ultraviolet-visible-infrared spectrum offer the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of visible and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly in the 8-13 ìm atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, prototype fabrication, and large batch manufacturing economy. The second primary objective is sub-scale fabrication and spectral characterization of the PRC roofing material. Subsequent demonstration of a functional PRC sample with quantified passive cooling power is key to the goals of attracting licensing clients and/or investments for commercial-grade manufacturing.

- abstractText: "This Phase I project will test and optimize a software system and
    digital tools designed to promote parent/caregiver-mediated dialogic reading routines
    in children ages 6 months to 5 years. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been
    shown to foster virtually all school-readiness indicators from cognitive and social-emotional
    development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. Research demonstrates
    that science learning should also be cultivated before kindergarten entry, so
    children begin formal schooling with age-appropriate content and conceptual knowledge
    and the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The increase of income
    inequality in the US underscores the urgency of closing ever-widening achievement
    gaps between children living in poverty and more affluent peers. Investments in
    early childhood have been shown to remediate educational deficits, so a cost-effective,
    home-based method of guiding parents and caregivers in a dialogic reading process
    can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps, the precursor
    to persistent achievement gaps, and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages
    they perpetuate. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and
    growing. Purchasers in this market include institutions (e.g., preschools, Head
    Start, social-service agencies, libraries), community initiatives, healthcare
    professionals working with families of young children, as well as individual families.\n
    \nThis project will build a complex technology systems architecture to sell, distribute,
    manage, and evaluate educative materials on commonly available digital devices
    of all form factors. The product uses a proprietary system to build hybrid reading
    selections with separate visible layers targeted for the two audiences - children
    and the adults reading to them. This approach engages both audiences, while providing
    actionable and effective guidance for caregivers for whom dialogic reading may
    be a new or not yet habitual practice. Along with layered selections, a key innovation
    employed by this project will be a set of proprietary algorithms that learns from
    user behavior and tailors the program to the needs of each individual. To further
    increase efficacy, this project will include a secure data-sharing portal to allow
    institutional clients to evaluate school readiness among their constituencies
    and to manage their programs accordingly. A robust content management system will
    support a variety of sales options and allow for dynamic updates and additions
    to the system content. Finally, an engagement system based on behavioral psychology
    will be developed to promote application stickiness aimed at building routines
    of reading and dialogic thinking."

    collaborative authoring tool to achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in technical
    skills required to author technology-enhanced assessments (TEAs). Additionally,
    it will seek to advance the frontiers of TEA authoring beyond individual assessments
    to encompass the creation of personalized TEA pathways for diverse learners. The
    effort will explore novel technologies including a symbolic abstraction to enable
    visual design and implementation of complex programming constructs, and the representation
    of TEAs as \"intelligent objects\" interoperable with disparate and proprietary
    assessment platforms. This effort seeks to break the stranglehold of large organizations
    on a growing assessments market that marginalizes educators due to barriers of
    cost and technology skills. It will empower educators by making available easy-to-use
    tools that enable creation and sharing of open TEAs and TEA pathways to support
    deeper learning at scale, allowing educators to distribute TEAs in a classroom
    without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system, triggering the evolution
    of a peer-to-peer marketplace for teacher-created assessments. This disruption
    bears the potential to empower educator communities at scale and impact all learners

    assessments. \n\nThis project will feature two distinctive innovations. The first
    is a visual programming environment with symbolic abstraction of complex programming
    constructs that are imperative for the design and creation of TEAs. This will
    enable intuitive authoring of complex TEAs by non-programmers (an impossibility
    today) and break down the biggest friction point for achieving access to TEAs
    at scale. The second is an open format for representation of TEAs as intelligent
    objects that are platform agnostic and \"embeddable\" in any assessment delivery
    system. This will facilitate distribution and usage of TEAs in browsers and thin
    client environments without the need for server side functionality mandated by
    proprietary systems. This will eventually break the stranglehold of proprietary
    assessment delivery systems that tie TEA access to their platforms. The project
    will pursue two primary research questions: How efficient and useful is the TEA
    authoring experience for non-technical educators? Are the TEAs effective in eliciting
    targeted reasoning and thinking processes? These research questions will help
    validate the technical feasibility of our innovative use of the proposed tool
    to enable easy TEA creation and distribution, and the efficacy of the complex
    TEAs created using the proposed project in providing evidence of target learning."

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to develop an automated and cost-effective method of producing complex carbon fiber parts with a 3D printing process that manages to achieve the full performance of traditional carbon fiber parts while allowing greater use of carbon fiber in applications where machined aluminum was previously the only option. This project involves first testing basic mechanical properties and adjusting processing parameters, and then looking towards using the 5-axis capabilities of the machine to place carbon fibers in multiple directions, allowing for complex parts that need strength in all directions. This novel manufacturing method for carbon fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic parts will greatly expand the markets that can benefit from increased use of carbon fiber materials, including aerospace, high-performance automotive, and custom biomedical parts. By lowering barriers to high performance part development, this technology will also allow smaller companies to fabricate high performance products and create a variety of technical and non-technical jobs within small businesses.


    This project seeks to prove the feasibility of producing high performance carbon fiber parts with a 3D printing process. A 5-axis machine and nozzle has been designed for use with continuous carbon fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastics that will be able to produce complex parts that are able to take complex, multi-axial loads. The primary focus of this project is to generate laminates with comparable properties to traditional continuous carbon fiber manufacturing processes, which would indicate the viability of using this process for high performance parts in aerospace applications, which no composite 3D printing has yet to achieve. After demonstrating the capability of forming high performance laminates, this project will begin focusing on the generating representative parts with reinforcing layers printing in the z-axis. Prior to printing multi-axial parts, this project will focus on achieving novel layered composite structures including variable stiffness laminates and integrated honeycomb cores. The combination of high mechanical properties at a laminate level, tailorability of properties through precise fiber orientation, and the ability to effectively transfer loads to fibers in any direction, will signify a new frontier in the technology and markets for carbon fiber reinforced polymers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes reliable and consistent fluid resuscitation (i.e., intravenous administration of fluids) for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring fluid management. The goal of fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients is to restore blood volume in the circulatory system to an acceptable level in order to ensure adequate tissue perfusion (i.e., blood delivery to tissue). However, large intrapatient and interpatient variability in physiological parameters as well as the effect of different illnesses and medications can result in under- and over-resuscitation of ICU patients by the clinical staff. Optimal fluid resuscitation is especially critical for the recovery of patients with severe sepsis (i.e., patients with sepsis and acute organ dysfunction) or septic shock (i.e., patients with sepsis and persistent or refractory hypotension or tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation). In these patients, ineffective arterial circulation due to vasodilation (i.e., dilation of blood vessels) and capillary leakage (i.e., increased distribution of fluids into the interstitial space) needs to be compensated by fluid management.

    The proposed project involves developing a clinical decision support system for fluid resuscitation for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU. Specifically, a cloud-based clinical decision support system will be developed, which will use continuous measurements from hemodynamic monitoring devices to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid management. In this project, a clinical decision support algorithm that will guide the clinician in fluid management will be developed and a clinical study at our partner hospital will be performed. A critical drawback with using a model-based approach to compute the patient's fluid requirement is that accurate parameter values are needed for the model. However, high-fidelity models do not exist and current models cannot fully account for the physiology and response of the patient to fluids. The proposed framework does not need any patient-specific information (e.g., age, gender, weight, diagnosis, concomitant medication, etc.). Furthermore, the framework does not require an accurate model of the patient dynamics and the patient specific physiological parameters.

    the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research
    is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage
    to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important
    and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected
    ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing
    (pressure).  Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is
    a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care.  Delays in medical intervention
    further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden
    associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly,
    the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates
    from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention
    paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing

    as a measure of wound healing.  A simple system enabling early detection of imminent
    skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations
    and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept sensor
    is designed to reside daily in a patient?s shoe to record temperatures while the
    patient experiences damaging activity such as walking or standing, alerting the
    patient to impending tissue injury. The sensor can also reside daily in a patient?s
    medical-treatment cast, providing a constant readout of skin temperature indicating
    tissue healing, allowing for out-patient monitoring and decreasing repeated visits

    This SBIR Phase I project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering the barriers to innovation.


    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called functional lithography - it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to discover and develop new materials using functional lithography, to push the limits of the materials that are available in additive manufacturing.

In short, the results of this research will not only improve FWA detection efficiency, but enable detecting new types of FWA.  Societal impact includes reduced costs to the taxpayer for government supported programs such as Medicare through better FWA detection. More broadly, the system could be used to find terrorist and crime networks, detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under-medication, over-medication, and even incorrect medications.

    The proposed project will apply a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities such as doctors with information about doctors (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by developing a new way to automatically discover those relations and then combining those relations with the information about doctors through machine learning, thus vastly improving prediction accuracy. The method uses relation information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa. It is believed that this method will hugely improve the ability to detect FWA. The goal is to achieve a 50% true positive rate in a database of fraud-convicted doctors published monthly by the government.  The scope of the project involves analyzing several different types of health insurance claims formats (e.g., Medicare) and producing a fraud score, which then others can use. The anticipated results include a fraud score for most doctors in the U.S. (at least those who deal with Medicare), APIs to these scores, and an interactive visual system that claims investigators can use to reduce their workload while accurately identifying FWA.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to a wide range of electronics in the areas of communications, Internet, portable electronics, and power electronics. Although magnetic based transformers have been the industry standard for over a century they have many negatives including miniaturization difficulties, electromagnetic interference issues, and issues with larger voltage step-up applications. The main goal of the research is to develop a ceramic replacement for magnetic transformers that is both conducive to miniaturization, provides higher power densities, provides a large increase in safe operating temperatures, and that is cost competitive with standard magnetic devices. This technology will provide important advantages for many applications; the ability to produce at low cost also opens up large new markets that are not easily reached using conventional magnetics.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to develop new low temperature sintering processes and transformer structures that enable the use of base metal electrodes to replace very expensive platinum. This drastically reduces costs of ceramic transformers and substantially improves performance due to the fact that a poor electrical/thermal conductor, Platinum, is now replaced with base metal (Copper) that is a high performance electrical/thermal conductor. This translates into both higher power throughput in devices that are lighter weight and lower profile and also a new ability to now match the high temperature range of wide bandgap power devices. The success of this program immediately leads to a revolutionary next step of being able to insert power management/conversion electronics directly within integrated circuits such as in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a portable, low cost blood typing and anemia screening device for use in blood donation centers, hospitals, humanitarian efforts and the military.   This helps society because every two seconds in United States someone needs blood, yet less than 4% of Americans donate blood.  Unfortunately, 15-20% of blood collected is wasted due to over collection of unneeded blood types and related blood type logistics.  12 million units of blood are collected annually in US with 108 million units worldwide.   U.S. blood centers are under significant economic pressures to reduce per unit blood costs and thus waste reduction tools and strategies are in demand.  Blood unit costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so this device provides the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) to reduce blood product waste and better match supply with hospital demand.   This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. The potential economic savings has the potential to be $400M and will contribute to reducing the overall cost of U.S. health care.

    The proposed project will advance knowledge across multiple fields.  It adapts knowledge in microfluidics and the use of electric fields to characterize cells to identify the molecular expression on blood cells responsible for ABO-Rh blood type.  This project advances the use of electric fields to rapidly measure cell concentration.  This project develops software for real time tracking of cell population motion, which is highly valuable in many cell microscopy applications.  This project also adapts advanced pattern recognition tools like machine learning to extract even more information from the cell behaviors. This work also extends statistical analysis from static population means to analysis of functional data - a field in its infancy - via a critical application.   Finally, the device and electronics engineering will advance under the principle that "simple is best", leading to fewer potential failure points and less costly manufacture. This work advances scientific knowledge and will be published and widely disseminated after securing additional IP. It is also a powerful alternative to expensive antigen/antibody molecular recognition reactions (i.e. traditional blood typing) for medical screening and diagnosis for future point of care diagnostic applications.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends
    to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for
    biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine.  Biomarkers and radiotracers
    are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
    metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer
    and other illnesses.  They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine
    if treatment is effective.  Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging
    of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to
    detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis
    and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical
    that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into
    many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently
    produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These
    cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.
    \ Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under
    development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a
    novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using
    unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11
    more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.
    \ It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient
    production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient
    recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11
    can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target
    materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology
    allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride
    nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most
    a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered
    in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production
    targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process
    for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest
    yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop
    BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the reduction in severe patient morbidity and elimination of hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures by the U.S. healthcare system each year on revision surgeries and unnecessary procedures associated with late detection of post-surgical blood clots. Surgeons have the ability to prevent these catastrophic events, but only if the onset of the clot can be detected in a timely manner. Currently, of the patients who form clots after the targeted surgeries, half will suffer from a surgical failure due to the shortcomings of current modalities. This technology gives clinicians the ability to non-invasively track changes in blood flow within critical vessels to enable intervention prior to any compromise in health and prevent a majority of these catastrophic incidents. Beyond significant decreases in patient suffering and morbidity, such interventions will have an enormous positive economic impact on the health care system. This technology can also substantially improve clinical understanding of the clotting process and possibly enable non-invasive therapeutic treatments for these patients who otherwise would receive surgery.

    The proposed project offers significant intellectual and scientific merit associated with new methods of ultrasound flow analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a system that is able to collect a 3D volume of ultrasound data and automatically extract the blood flow data in the region of interest by detecting an implantable component. This novel approach to measuring vascular flow will be the first to enable detection of localized post-operative clot formation rather than detecting clot-related issues via delayed and indirect methods that leave patients at risk for surgical failures. This technique can allow for intervention earlier than all other available methods, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. Furthermore, this method enables automatic detection of critical changes in blood flow, eliminating the risk of human error. Lastly, dissemination of the technology developed in this proposal represents an important milestone towards the creation of simpler, more automated ultrasound systems that can place this non-invasive, non-ionizing modality in the hands of non-expert clinicians for use in a broader spectrum of medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

    in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas
    related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool
    that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights
    early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows
    for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication
    among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality
    designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products,
    less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations).
    The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering
    design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design
    specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an
    e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.
    \ Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.
    \ Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented.
    \n\nThe project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support
    system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such
    oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in
    budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible,
    yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design
    process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in
    the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center
    of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS,
    correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides
    real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically
    configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant
    analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development
    tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer
    requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of
    the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases.
    The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative
    tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning
    experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves
    the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited,
    generic learning objectives for engineering design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide wireless technology for economic high-speed internet connectivity in under-served rural regions, addressing the needs of 40 million Americans and over 50% of the global population. The technological developments in this project will pave the way for adoption of Massive, or Many-Antenna MIMO technologies in next-generation wireless systems by addressing scalability bottlenecks with innovative hardware and protocol design. The result of this project will be a revolutionary new wireless system for internet service providers addressing an $80 billion fixed wireless systems market and connecting under-served global communities to high-speed internet commerce, communications, education, and entertainment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a production-ready Television White Space (TVWS) Massive MU-MIMO wireless system for IP data traffic, then use it to characterize for the first time diverse, large-scale multi-user TVWS channels. This project will demonstrate the first economically-viable Massive MIMO system, as well as the first point-to-multipoint wireless system capable of non-line-of-sight ranges over 10s of miles with over 2 Gbps of aggregate capacity. The system will be used to measure and characterize TVWS channels at scale in various rural environments, with large beamforming arrays serving tens of clients tens of miles away. In particular, these measurements will explore the effect of range, environment, user separation, and polarization on real-world achievable capacity. The results will be used to guide the design, optimization, and deployment of rural TVWS broadband networks across the world.

    This SBIR Phase II project offers a unique approach to teaching the difficult content of operating with fractions through interactive, adaptive games. Existing products are not effective at teaching fractions, and half of US eighth graders cannot correctly order three fractions, a fourth grade standard. Current research and the Common Core State Standards emphasize using a number line to teach fractions, which is a more effective approach; however, leading curricula are not fully aligned to this method. This project aims to improve 3rd-5th grade students' understanding of fractions through engaging apps that encourage estimation and problem-solving. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF's mission of improving mathematics education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace for engaging, effective software that aligns with Common Core and provides data-driven intervention support. This software will be specially designed for children who struggle in mathematics and will meet the criteria for intervention software, further increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate income.

    This project aims to improve children's use of efficient strategies in estimating and solving fractions arithmetic by targeting children?s metastrategic awareness and metacognitive abilities. This project will include the development of a series of fractions apps and game-based data reporting for teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions. Extracting actionable insight from children?s gameplay rather than from standardized tests is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change teaching and learning. The development process will include wireframing novel gameplay and developing app components and features. The backend system will identify learning patterns within clickstream data collected during play and apply data-mining techniques to these patterns. Instead of assessing single actions as correct or incorrect, the backend will identify series of actions and associate them with a particular strategy. This data will be used to inform instructors, test hypotheses, and provide evidence for learning. A dynamic content generation engine will use the insights extracted from student data to provide learners with highly targeted, fine-tuned activities. The project?s research will include both informal design research and a randomized control study with 3rd-5th grade students to determine the effects of using the software on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project enables the research and development of
    a new hybrid fixed-fluidized biomass gasifier design that allows for a higher
    carbon conversion efficiency over a far wider range of feedstocks than what current
    commercially available biomass-to-electricity technologies are able to offer.
    This technological development serves the public interest by increasing the economic
    viability of renewable waste-to-energy projects. Biomass waste accumulation from
    forest thinning and agriculture generate approximately 166 million tons of biomass
    each year in the United States alone and is problematic to dispose of due to air
    quality regulations, which restrict open burning, and tipping fees from waste
    sites that have to mitigate methane production from decomposition. Instead of
    open burning or uncontrolled decomposition, biomass gasification enables these
    resources to be utilized locally to replace fossil fuels and to sequester carbon
    to mitigate climate change. Biomass energy is currently limited by feedstock requirements
    (typically restricted to standardized wood pellets), which has constrained the
    implementation of biomass-to-energy plants in the U.S. This project seeks to greatly
    expand the feedstock characteristic options available for biomass energy to offer
    an off-the-shelf commercial solution to sustainable energy project developers
    in the U.S. and organizations responsible for biomass waste processing. Approximately
    150 jobs are expected to be generated in the US to support these two industries,
    through manufacturing and project development, as well as associated sales and
    income tax revenue. \n\nCommercially available downdraft and fluidized bed biomass
    gasifiers are hindered by three main root technical problems that significantly
    constrain the economic viability of state-of-the-art biomass-to-electricity projects:
    1) each is limited by the small range of feedstock particle sizes it can process;
    2) maximum allowable reaction temperatures are limited due to ash fusibility temperatures;
    and 3) the ash fusibility temperature is too low to maximize tar cracking. The
    proposed technical solution separates the vaporized tar and small feedstock particle
    sizes from the larger particles and high ash solid charcoal.  This separation
    decouples the temperature requirements and allows for greater tar cracking potential
    at higher temperatures while maintaining a lower oxidation temperature for the
    char to increase carbon conversion efficiency??overcoming all three root technical
    problems. The goal of the research is to identify and validate the dimensions
    and parameters required to maintain stable biomass gasification with improved
    tar cracking efficiency and reduced ash clinkering risk. The scope of the project
    includes proving the proposed technology at a gas capacity of 20kW, which will
    be scaled up to a 150kW to be able to provide the algorithm to dimension the technology
    at any scale. The development of a fully fuel agnostic gasifier is the so-called
    holy grail of gasification and the successful completion of the project will be
    a significant step toward this goal, enabling the technology to scale successfully
    and be disseminated in almost any market or sector with a biomass waste stream."

    the modules using statistical validation techniques. Creative talent will remain
    the great differentiator in the coming world, and the organizations that thrive
    there will do so because they have the right potentials.  Using the semantics-based
    psychometric approach, this project designs exercises and models that assess one's
    creativity. This project will help employers in acquiring creative employees and
    also train and educate current employees in ways by which they can become more
    creative.  The market is vast, encompassing potentially all employers who hire
    and manage workers with symbol-analytic skills.  According to the 2010 U.S Census,
    there are over 143M people employed in the workforce. This project will expand
    to various sectors of the workforce using strategic partnerships with distribution
    channels in workforce education companies, and talent/human capital management
    companies.   \n\n\nCurrently, creative thinking strategies and assessments are
    taught by experts and consultants in the form of workshops.  Such semantic creativity
    assessment is a manual, time-consuming and expensive process.  This project creates
    a set of open-ended exercises and evaluates each exercise based on the four creative-thinking
    dimensions: 1) Originality:  Original thinking capacity and ability to generate
    novel and out-of-the-box solutions; 2) Fluency: Ideation capacity and ability
    to push past the first set of known responses; 3)Flexibility: Divergent-thinking
    capacity and ability to think non-linearly; and 4)\tElaboration: Detailed-oriented
    and ability to provide intrinsic details about each possible solution and response.
    This project automates such testing by using advances in semantic-based psychometric
    modelling, natural language processing (NLP), semantic networks from computational
    linguistics and computational power for statistical mining of large corpora.  Due
    to ease of scalability, this solution is not limited to any one country or region.
    The solution can be deployed world-wide. Currently, this project has gathered
    data from 161 different countries around the world.  This project is the first
    step towards automation of open-ended exercises in various fields and contexts
    such as situational judgement assessments, emotional intelligence and motivational

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that due to the increased mobility of human beings and the nature of modern economic and social activities a variety of power challenges need to be addressed for portable electronic and mechanical devices. The needs include quick power delivery, light-weight but high-capacity energy storage, superior low-temperature operation and ability to handle millions of cycles. On average a soldier, a construction worker or an everyday handyman carry between 50 to 100lb of weight while they are working in their duty sites. A significant portion of this load is from the primary and backup batteries used for their tools and equipment, because corded delivery of power is not always possible. Computing, communication, biomedical and avionic industries are also constantly searching for light-weight but highly efficient energy storage gadgets. The ability to integrate graphene and carbon nanostructure based microsupercapacitors in the next generation energy delivery/storage solutions for portable devices and tools will open the doors for new education, research, product development and economic growth. Due to ultra-light-weight, transparency, extremely high thermal stability and tensile strength, and superior electrical conductivity graphene based supercapacitor would also be suitable for flexible, printable, transparent and wearable electronics.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project plans to develop a non-Faradic, thin-film and electrochemical microsupercapacitor utilizing graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT) with high gravimetric energy density. The proposed microsupercapacitor would combine high energy storage capacity of batteries with high power delivery capability of regular capacitors. It would be compatible to commercial lithographic techniques and printable circuit technologies. A limiting factor in the miniaturization of the existing carbon-based supercapacitors is a relatively low volumetric energy density (VED) due to the poor packing density of structures like tangled CNTs. The VED of CNT-based supercapacitors is many orders of magnitude lower than the mainstream energy storage devices. The opportunity to miniaturize the supercapacitor exists with novel designs that strive to minimize its intrinsic components like electrodes and separators that do not directly contribute to cell energy storage. The proposed design would primarily use graphene nanoribbon (GNR) as electrode, which will not have the tangling issue of CNT. Due to the 2D flat nature of GNR the scaling and packing density of GNR devices would be extremely high. The long-term goal is to achieve an energy density over 100 Wh/kg using an array of the proposed microsupercapacitors.

    \ In addition to aiding the educational experience of university students involved
    in part testing, this project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing
    jobs for the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts.\n  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is to utilize and greatly expand upon the findings of impact
    bonding dissimilar metals from previous bodies of work to advance the scientific
    understanding of how ceramics impact bond to metals and how these bonded joints
    survive or potentially degrade when undergoing intense impact fatigue cycle testing.
    Although fatigue cycle testing on metal/ceramic interfaces has been documented
    when the joint is formed through other methods, the PI and team seek to perform
    fatigue cycle testing when metal/ceramic interfaces are optimized for strength
    and durability by the use of near net-shaped impact bonding. Previous methods
    of attaching ceramics to metals have been limited to brazing and adhesives, each
    of which is limited by temperature and strength. Other mechanical methods of joining
    ceramics and metals will simply not hold up during impact fatigue cycling due
    to the different compression properties of the joined materials. This project
    aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals
    and will also further enhance the knowledge of high velocity impact bonding systems.
    Of particular interest is the impact bonding of ceramics/composites such as tungsten
    carbide to hardened steel because of immediate industrial applications."

    Technology Transfer Phase I project is enabling real-time seizure detection in
    intensive care units ? especially units at hospitals without 24/7 neurologist
    coverage to interpret scans in a timely manner. High performance real-time detection
    of critical EEG events in an ICU setting will increase the use of brain monitoring
    in critical care, thereby improving patient outcomes, increasing the efficiency
    of healthcare and decreasing the cognitive burden placed on caregivers. Current
    approaches to automatic detection suffer from unacceptably high false alarm rates
    that overwhelm care providers, and are of limited use in this environment. A reliable
    service would expand access to quality care for 877,500 neurologically compromised
    critical care patients in 4,000+ community hospitals in the United States. The
    market opportunity for real-time seizure detection in the ICU is approximately
    $80M per year. \n \nThe proposed project will develop an assistive technology
    for EEG analysis to support clinicians in evaluating EEG signals for medically
    important events in an ICU environment. Analysis of EEG signals requires a highly
    trained neurologist, and is time consuming and expensive since identifying rare
    clinical events requires analysis of long data streams. Most community hospitals
    do not have 24/7 access to trained neurologists and can not provide continuous
    EEG monitoring to detect non-convulsive seizures in neurologically compromised
    patients. Reliable automatic detection improves patient access to long-term brain
    monitoring by auto-scanning EEG signals and flagging sections of the signal that
    need further review by a clinician. The tool reduces the amount of data needing
    manual review by two orders of magnitude, offering substantial productivity gains
    in a clinical setting. The project will leverage an innovative approach for integrating
    hidden Markov models, deep learning and active learning to allow the rapid development
    of a high performance machine learning system from minimal amounts of manually

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to bring the industrial advanced manufacturing method of abrasive waterjet cutting to individual consumers by fully redesigning the core components of the machine to meet the budgetary needs of a consumer.  This project parallels the current movement of scaling down advance manufacturing techniques such as laser cutting and 3D printing to the growing desktop fabrication market.  Unfortunately, the desktop digital fabrication tools currently available to consumer market are restricted to producing goods in only soft materials like plastics, and wood.  The biggest advantage of abrasive waterjet cutting is its cutting ability in a wide range of materials including plastics, metals, stone, ceramics, glass, and composites.  With this technology finally accessible to a wider audience, everyone from the middle school robotocist, to a creative entrepreneur, to the makerspaces, to artisans, to small businesses will be able to digitally create physical designs in the full gambit of sheet materials that are currently available.


    Current commercial waterjet designs operate in a high pressure region that makes components prohibitively expensive for the consumer market.  To make the technology viable for the masses it must be adapted to a lower pressure space to leverage the necessary component cost savings across the machine.  This starts by creating a new performance model for low-pressure abrasive waterjet cutting through the design and execution of a test matrix that will determine how cutting performance is affected by various waterjet parameters (water pressure, water flow rate, abrasive flow rate, etc.).  With this understanding, the heart of the system, the hydraulic pump, will be adapted and customized from a pump construction that is not currently used for waterjet cutting. Lastly, this effort concludes with a ground-up redesign of the waterjet?s Cutting Head (the assembly that ejects the high velocity mixture of water and abrasive) utilizing low-cost materials, manufacturing processes and a unique geometry optimized for low-pressure cutting.

    Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to drive safer and more cost-effective emergency
    department care pathways by improved risk stratification at patient presentation
    (triage) compared to the current standards of care. E-triage addresses the ED
    crowding crisis (136 million visits in US annually) that adversely affects patients'
    health outcomes and has led to a state of financial unsustainability in America's
    safety net.  E-triage's approach supports new ED operational models to separate
    service streams for acutely ill and non-urgent patients.  New streaming models
    are needed to mitigate ED crowding by: (1) conserving scarce ED resources for
    patients truly in need of emergency care, and (2) preventing unnecessary waiting
    and costly resource over-utilization for non-urgent patients.  It does this by
    using local ED electronic health record (EHR) data to scientifically risk-stratify
    patients based on risk of critical events and severity of illness.  E-triage meets
    a commercial opportunity to mitigate crowding, enhance ED operational performance,
    and improve the value of healthcare delivered to ED patients.  The proposed project
    will transition E-triage to a scalable and commercially available platform under
    a business model that supports growth.  \n\nThe proposed project will yield a
    scaled and commercially available e-triage decision support platform that is currently
    being piloted in multiple emergency departments (EDs).  E-triage deploys a novel
    combination of data-science methods and flexible information technology architecture
    that supports usability by diverse ED customers. The tool relies on advancements
    in machine learning methods, mechanisms to harness user feedback, and software
    technology that is flexible and interoperable with EHR systems.  It must also
    securely transmit and store patient data and be computationally efficient to accommodate
    fast-paced ED environments.  E-triage enables rapid data-driven prognostication
    of ED patients at presentation based on risk of critical events and severity of
    illness using common locally collected ED data.  Compared to US triage practice
    standards, which relies heavily on provider subjective judgment, e-triage demonstrates
    improved identification of high- and low-risk patients based on evidence from
    retrospective and prospective evaluation.  E-triage is disruptive in its design
    to support new ED operational models that separate service streams for acutely
    ill and non-urgent patients toward reducing the burden of ED crowding."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the massive unmet need of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which affects over 12 million Americans and results in over 65,000 amputations each year. This project will provide the proof of concept for a novel drug delivery technique that will improve the durability of procedures to restore blood flow in PAD patients. The result technology will help reduce the burden of disease while reducing the significant societal and health system costs caused by amputations.

    The proposed project will address the challenge of providing controlled drug dose to arteries of varying diameter and length. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients have atherosclerotic lesions that are long and diffuse, requiring treatment to multiple sites with different vessel diameters and lengths. Existing drug delivery platforms require the use of multiple, expensive devices to treat these patients. This project will demonstrate that a single ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery catheter can provide drug delivery to different artery diameters and lengths, providing significant potential cost and time savings during endovascular procedures. In order apply the desired drug dose to arteries of varying size, real time imaging feedback will be used to adjust the treatment settings to compensate for changes in size. To achieve this goal, ex vivo swine arteries of different sizes will be treated under physiological flow conditions while varying the treatment parameters in order to determine the effect of vessel size on delivered drug dose. From this project, algorithms that can control drug dose to match varying artery diameter will be developed for future in vivo animal model studies.

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a novel stimulation active paddle electrode technology.
    \ Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuromodulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology will double the therapeutic surface
    area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology will improve low-back pain relief,
    as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event of electrode
    movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project seeks
    to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit, by
    developing an active stimulation-grid electrode technology.  By positioning a
    tiny electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, we can create a 48 or 96
    channel stimulation grid which can be programmed to deliver precision therapy.
    \  To accomplish these goals, we will perform three critical tasks including:
    \ (1) design of the paddle electrode using electric field simulations to current-steer
    therapy to low-back pain fibers, (2) develop a prototype of the active stimulation
    grid lead using a tiny ceramic hermetic package and micro-circuit, and (3) validation
    of the recruitment of low-back pain fibers in the spinal cord.  The goal of the
    project is to develop proof-of-concept data to show that active-lead technology
    can improve delivery of therapy to low-back pain fibers.  Validation will be performed
    by recording the evoked potentials across the surface of all dorsal columns while
    stimulation is selectively applied to lateral electrodes caudal to the recording
    electrodes.  Electromyography control electrodes will be positioned within adjacent
    muscles to verify that dorsal roots are not activated."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve people's lives by creating the first wrist-based device that can reliably assess sleep quality. A large pool of undiagnosed patients and the growing population of the elderly point to a massive end-user market for sleep disorder diagnostics devices. The market is steadily increasing due to the visible tilt in preference from drugs to home care sleep tests that are more convenient and lack side effects. This trend is also due to improvements in consumer based sensor technology, limited number of technicians or specialized physicians, and long wait times. In accordance with these market needs, this project is designed to develop a system for assessing sleep at home in a patient friendly and easy to environment. This technology is expected to be especially attractive to elderly patients looking for alternatives to medications and traditional sleep disorder tests. Because the algorithm developed in this project will be tested and validated in a sleep laboratory, it will be accepted in both clinical and non-clinical setting.

    The proposed project is a research and development effort to create and test a new system for detecting sleep stages. Because poor sleep is common in modern society and has considerable consequences, including decreased work productivity/abilities, increased rate of accidents and traffic fatalities, and increased health care costs, there is a great need for a new system that can provide an ambulatory assessment of sleep quality under real-world conditions. Although there are many wrist-based devices on the market that are well-suited for measuring sleep in both home and clinical settings, none of these devices can currently allow reliable assessment of sleep quality. This project will develop a new algorithm for a wrist-based device that will detect sleep quality based on actigraphy, photoplethysomnography, and physiological responses to sensory stimulation. This research will apply a multi-modal approach to assess quality of sleep and advance the science of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is that it will benefit healthcare by improving patient outcome and procedural efficiency. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to guide interventions, this is challenged by the limited access to the patient inside the scanners. Current practices - either removing the patient and manually inserting the tools or moving the patient to another modality - lengthen the procedures, reduce accuracy, and increase possible trauma. The proposed novel robotic and MRI technologies will address those limitations, enabling performing procedures with the patient inside the MRI scanner. Thus continuous MRI images can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions offering more accurate lesion targeting, shorter procedure times, reduced patient trauma, faster recovery, lower cost, and improved patient outcome. This would transform interventional medicine by improving diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with high impact to patients, their families, and society. With faster patient recovery, this technology will reduce the overall cost of healthcare and enable faster return of patients to the workforce. The novel robotic technologies will generate new positions in R&D and production in medical industries, as well as economic benefits from employing highly skilled personnel.

    The proposed project will develop novel technologies at the intersection of robotics and imaging. The solid-media transmission (SMT) mechanism offers the flexibility of fluidic lines but in a system that is leak-free and less complex and has a more compact power take-off arrangement. The SMT mechanism enables the development of an MRI-compatible manipulator that is adaptable and scalable for use in a wide range of medical interventions, carrying and maneuvering virtually any tool. The proposed research will elucidate the effect of geometric and material parameters on the operation of the SMT mechanism. A prototype SMT-actuated manipulator will be used to demonstrate the functionality of this technology in real-time MRI-guided procedures in-situ and disseminate it with on-site and hands-on demonstrations to clinical venues. Beyond the merit in medical applications, this research enhances scientific and technological understanding by demonstrating an alternative mechanism of remote actuation or local distribution of actuation within a manipulator, which creates the potential to generate novel mechatronic assemblies with applications in automation, oil/gas industries, and aerospace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require recovery care to get fully well after being discharged from the hospital. Transitions of care from acute (hospital) to post-acute (short-term rehabilitation and skilled nursing) settings impact millions of Americans every year. Seniors overindex on utilization of post-acute care, as a consequence of natural age-related degeneration and the need for longer recovery periods. By improving post-hospital coordination of care across the continuum, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction stand to improve for America?s aging population. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon methods for user-centered data capture in healthcare. Our proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as electronic health records and claims data from both acute and post-acute care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    diagnoses. \n\nThe proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing
    lateral flow isotachophoresis diagnostic (LID) technology for chlamydia, which
    currently does not have a POC test available in the US. The proposed technology
    applies an electric field across a lateral flow test to perform isotachophoresis
    (ITP), a powerful method for extracting and concentrating target biomolecules.
    LID improves assay sensitivity by more than 100x, making it suitable for a variety
    of indications that are currently not practical for existing lateral flow assays.
    The increased sensitivity is expected to allow clinicians to make confident diagnoses
    using these tests. This STTR will address key technical hurdles by developing
    the required chemistry and protocols for high accuracy chlamydia diagnostics using
    LID. The ultimate objective of the project is to show that the required electronics
    can be made at low cost and meet regulatory guidelines such as FCC emissions."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide early stage breast cancer patients
    with a comprehensive treatment option that completely eliminates all cancer during
    a patient's first surgery. Currently, >20% of the ~200,000 breast cancer patients
    who are treated with lumpectomy surgery annually in the US must have a re-operation
    because of a lack of clear margins in the initial surgery. Furthermore, most breast
    cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy must also undergo expensive ($17,000+)
    radiation therapy that can last up to 7 weeks. Furthermore, due to the need for
    adjuvant radiation therapy, lumpectomy is not an option for many breast cancer
    patients globally. However, intraoperatively destroying a thin rim of tissue around
    the tumor with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to decrease the need
    for re-operations and radiation therapy. RFA is a thermal ablation therapy used
    commonly in liver and kidney cancer treatment. However, no RFA devices have been
    designed for the post-lumpectomy breast cavity. Development of such a device will
    allow for early stage breast cancer patients worldwide to receive local therapy
    in minutes for a fraction of the cost of radiation. \n\n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop technologies for post-lumpectomy radiofrequency ablation therapy.
    The proposed RFA device is designed such that it will mechanically fit the surgical
    cavity uniformly for optimal treatment. However, a uniform ablation depth around
    the device will not always be desired due to the location of the tumor and skin.
    This project, therefore, also proposes an automated system that can be pre-programmed
    by a surgeon to control the three-dimensional ablation shape produced by the RFA
    device. The following intellectual merits are in the proposed project: (1) a system
    that can create three-dimensional maps of ablation status of tissue (unablated
    vs. undergoing ablation vs. ablated); (2) a system that can create three-dimensional
    ablation shapes using the proposed RFA device. These control systems will be developed
    and validated with benchtop experiments in animal tissues. In the future, this
    will allow early-stage breast cancer patients to receive optimal customized treatment
    with post-lumpectomy RFA to reduce the risk of re-operation and future cancer
    recurrence."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will include providing affordable connected home care for senior citizens (often with severe chronic conditions and incurring significant medical expenses) living independently at home, resulting in significant improvements in healthcare quality and a reduced burden on existing healthcare resources.  This project will not only decrease the burden on family caregivers, who often give up their jobs to provide free care for senior citizens at home, but will also allow organizations such as retirement communities, memory care units and assisted living facilities to monitor multiple patients remotely, thus reducing the need for overworked professional caregivers. This project also aims to overcome deficits present in current home health monitoring technologies by taking a more holistic approach to providing preventive care by using advanced analytics and cutting edge sensor technology that is affordable and accessible to all.

    The proposed project aims to overcome a pressing societal challenge (the burgeoning aging population) facing many developed and emerging countries, including the U.S. (the aging baby boomers) and China (the reverse 4-2-1 family pyramid due to the former one-child policy). Despite failing health, most senior citizens prefer to live independently at home and hence the focus of current healthcare technologies has shifted from traditional clinical care to "at-home" care for senior citizens. The proposed project will develop a smart and connected home monitoring system for senior care that is unique in its technology and service model including: (1) affordable and non-invasive home-based mobile health technology with wearable human and object activity sensors for monitoring health-related motion and daily activities and a cost-effective pre-configured home gateway using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and 3G communication; (2) advanced mobile health analytics algorithms and alerts for fall detection, health progression monitoring, and patient health anomaly detection; and (3) a comprehensive patient health activity portal and support for reporting user activity and health status and engaging with family members. The overall goal is to make aging at home easier, less expensive, and safer for senior citizens.

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project will develop Android and Apple iPhone apps
    to allow for mobile-enabled, rapid correction of improper or dangerous techniques
    in sports activities. The project goal is to eliminate dangerous, unhealthy behaviors
    in young athletes and replace them with non-damaging skills and techniques.  In
    its simplest form, the technology presents a player with a video clip of their
    own behavior, paired with head impact data measured using worn sensors and physics-based
    simulations showing what occurs in the brain during dangerous hits. The quantitative
    biomechanical data is used to predict possible functional brain deficits and presented
    to the user in an age-appropriate manner. By combining a mouth guards with sensors,
    sideline video replay technology, physics-based brain simulations, on-line instruction
    and observational learning, coaches and trainers will be able to correct dangerous
    techniques and behaviors in sports activity as they occur. Coaches and trainers
    will also be able to show players video of their own technique following a significant
    impact to the head next to a synchronized clip of an athlete completing the same
    movements, but with no head impact. As a result, children and adolescents will
    learn there is never an acceptable level of head contact. Whether applied to football,
    hockey, lacrosse, soccer or one of any number of physical activities, this coaching
    tool will provide immediate instruction and self-reinforcing behavior modification.\n
    \nThe proposed technology enables unprecedented resolution of the biomechanical
    response during sports activities by combining synchronized video, wearable impact
    sensors and physics-based simulations that will identify dangerous incidents,
    with the goal of obtaining real time technique modification and therefore a dramatic
    reduction in the occurrence of injury.  It is important to note that while sensor
    technology and analytical methods have advanced dramatically in the last several
    years, the integration of synchronized video technology would be a critical tool
    in helping players understand and prevent dangerous head impacts from occurring
    in contact sports.  The mobile apps will be an innovative approach to reducing
    the number and severity of concussive and sub concussive blows to the head. Integrating
    sensor data, synchronized with video technology and physics-based impact simulations
    showing what occurs in the brain during dangerous impacts into a mobile app is
    innovative to the sporting industry and offers an opportunity to improve player
    safety in sports. The broader impact of the system is to show students and athletes
    dangerous techniques as soon as they occur along side of how their behavior could
    be modified, which will reduce the occurrence of serious injuries in sports and
    fitness pursuits causing health-enhancing activities to be rendered much safer."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a cell sorting system to allow separation of two or more cell types to be used in cell therapies for treatment of cancer and other diseases.  Purification of specific cell populations from complex materials such as blood is a critical component of cell therapy manufacturing. However, since most protocols for clinical-grade cell purification rely on binding of magnetic particles to cells, promising cell therapies face the risk of transplanting residual and potentially toxic magnetic particles to human subjects. The steps currently required to eliminate this risk add complexity, time and cost to cell therapy manufacturing, limiting the wide-scale usefulness of promising new cell therapies. This project will develop a novel cell separation technology, free of magnetic particles, that can be readily scaled to levels required to enable clinical-scale manufacturing of highly pure and highly viable cell-based therapeutics. The aim is to perform multi-target cell sorting while simultaneously leaving cells free from contaminating tags.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel affinity chromatographic cell sorting (AFFICS) system, based on proprietary dissolvable hydrogel microbeads, for efficient simultaneous separation of two and more cell types directly from heterogeneous cell environments without requiring magnetic or fluorescent tagging of cells. To achieve this, the objectives are to 1) Design a column-based affinity chromatographic system with functionalized dissolvable hydrogel microbeads for single surface marker-based cell isolation from complex cell suspensions, leading to cell capture and target cell populations with >85% purity and viability. 2) Develop tandem connection of multiple columns for sequential cell separation based on two or more surface markers on a large scale. 3) Optimize the rapid release mechanism required for efficient simultaneous separation of two and more cell subpopulations while maintaining cell phenotype and viability. The proposed system will provide multi-target cell sorting at clinical scale while simultaneously leaving cells free of residual magnetic or fluorescent affinity tags.

    This SBIR Phase I project attempts to address a fundamental question for innovators: is my idea already patented?  This do-it-yourself-initially service will empower small-business enterprises with synthesized research of over 10 million patent documents within 10 minutes based on the concepts contained within the idea. Such a comprehensive, real-time, low-cost offering is currently unavailable for small-business entrepreneurs.  Current search tools do not synthesize the results into an executive summary, do not allow an entire document to be entered as the search input, and do not perform real-time concept/correlation computations.  This proposed innovation will enable the inventor to submit an entire document (the idea) as the search query; then, utilizing network mathematics and artificial-intelligence algorithms, this service will synthesize search results in real-time summarizing what patent documents are most related to the idea based on natural-language processing.  Such a service for small-business entrepreneurs would enable them to initially ascertain the novelty of their idea and give them an on-the-go education about the natural language used in patent documents in comparison to their idea.  This meta-innovation would objectively ascertain the intellectual-property merit of any proposed technology, enable small-business innovators, and foster the acceleration of innovation development in the United States.

    The development of latent semantic analysis (LSA) has enabled algorithm development to extract latent (or hidden) semantic structure from documents addressing two important word-sense ambiguity issues that text-matching search cannot: polysemy (single term with multiple meanings; i.e., strike as to hit [verb], to start up [verb], or to cease working [noun]) and synonymy (multiple terms with single meaning; i.e., car and automobile).  Albeit robust, this concept-search approach for large document collections is not tractable due to the high-complexity computational requirements for performing matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) necessary for LSA.   Approximation techniques that use subset approaches necessarily introduce some amount of systematic error.  To ascertain the most relevant documents in a large collection for a given focal document, this proposed innovation (search-subset LSA) will subset using proprietary search methodologies without any systematic error, reducing both the number of documents to compare and the number of terms to analyze thereby making real-time document correlations possible.  The aims of this research are: to identify the optimal subset approach for comprehensive nomological capture of top-correlation candidates, to ascertain optimal input parameters for the focal query document, and to develop a statistical test to confirm that no systematic bias is present in this approach.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will improve motivation, learning and self-esteem of children by incorporating well-established principles from behavioral psychology and gaming science.  The innovation disrupts conventional paradigms by advantageously leveraging the exploding screen time trends of digital games and social media, which are commonly a nemesis to learning and attention span.  Children's interactions with this system will provide insights into their ability to delay gratification, a skill that is critically linked to many positive societal and life outcomes.  Initially, the innovation will address a critical need to offer a personalized approach to accelerate compliance with Common Core Standards (Common Core) related to math fluency and mastery. Once the premise is validated, the new system will be used with the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder population to improve attention span and reduce impulsivity. Ultimately, the platform will integrate with existing learning management systems administered by schools so a variety of subjects including STEM and Common Core can be featured.  This combination will create a revolutionary education platform that is delivered through smart devices, so different types of learning can occur at home, school or on the go, thereby, making state-of-the art learning technologies readily available to diverse social economic groups.


    The technical innovation is a tablet and smartphone-based learning system that uses a neuro-cognitive model of a child's mental state to determine the optimal parameters to maximize learning as well as boost attention span.   Underlying the patent-pending platform are adaptive algorithms that merge established behavioral training principles including those from Precision Teaching and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder treatments together with the latest trends in gaming science.  Concurrently, the innovation will create behavioral and reward mechanisms intended to increase the level of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in both the learning and reward systems.  Tangentially, the innovation will accelerate important neurological pathways that can free up working memory and improve self-esteem. A paramount outcome is to create a comprehensive software exchange that can be delivered through all types of smart devices.  The project goal involves writing new software and algorithms, leveraging established software and evaluating the software and algorithms with controlled experiments. The technical hurdles to be addressed include: 1) creating new algorithms for an adaptive math-fact curriculum that improve math skills and attention span, 2) enhancing existing data stack with state-of-art machine learning that maintains higher learning performance and motivation, and 3) demonstrating consistent trends in classroom, tutoring and home settings.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will enable biomolecular research by developing a high precision micropump utilizing a magnetic shape memory (MSM) mechanism. The MSM mechanism translates magnetic energy into mechanical work through an MSM alloy. The MSM material replaces many of the mechanical parts found in other micropump technologies and can precisely manipulate the very small fluid volumes handled by many researchers, such as biomolecular physicists and electro-neurophysiologists. Precision micro-dosing will decrease the costs of such research by decreasing the volume of reagents consumed and by increasing the efficacy and efficiency of experiments. This project will develop laboratory instrumentation for the institutional research market and will later expand to enter the nearly $3 billion microfluidic devices market. It will further develop MSM technology that will translate to multiple markets including healthcare. The broader impacts range from improvements in personalized medicine through point-of-care diagnostics, to the development of more efficient drugs, for example in cancer treatment, through enhanced pharmaceutical research.

    The intellectual merit of this project focuses on increasing the pumping resolution of the MSM micropump for precision micro-dosing for laboratory research. The pump design is biomimetic and works similarly to how mammals swallow. By applying a magnetic field, a peristaltic motion is generated in the MSM material which can be used to repeatedly pump precise quantities of fluid. This technology boasts a unique combination of features including (1) contact-free magnetic actuation, (2) no mechanical parts, (3) combination of the pumping mechanism and valve into a single element, (4) reversibility of the flow direction, (5) operation even with a high back pressure, (6) applicability to gases and viscous liquids, and (7) high precision at small volumes. Reducing the size of the MSM magneto-mechanical transducer will increase the pumping resolution. Since the surface-area-to-volume ratio is larger for smaller MSM transducers, surface stresses must be controlled more delicately. One key outcome of this work will be the development of surface treatment methods to improve magneto-mechanical fatigue life and the performance of the device. Through systematic experiments, this project will establish fundamental processing-structure-properties-performance relationships for MSM transducers, and will also demonstrate prototype devices for biomolecular research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to refine, broaden and characterize a new family of optical chemosensor dyes designed for real-time monitoring and control of heavy-metal concentrations in industrial wastewater discharge. This will allow metal platers, metal finishers, circuit board manufacturers, ink manufacturers, and a multitude of other businesses that discharge heavy metal waste, the capability to reduce treatment costs by an average of 25% to 40%.  At the same time, this technology will assist in improving compliance with discharge limits defined by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Act and by local regulatory agencies. This would in turn reduce toxic metal treatment costs at downstream municipal wastewater treatment plants. It is estimated from market surveys that at least 15,000 businesses in the United States are potential customers for such a system.  The global market in this vertical is estimated to be at least $2 billion.  In addition, many other market segments, such as defense and homeland security, could potentially use these chemosensor arrays to permit accurate detection of heavy metals in real-world conditions.

    The intellectual merit of this project is that it further develops and evaluates a family of chemosensor dyes that are inherently stable over time and can be used for continuous, real-time, heavy-metal monitoring in wastewater treatment processes with detection limits relevant to environmental regulations. Earlier work demonstrated that sets of several of these dyes have significant promise to accurately and continuously measure the concentration of specific metals in wastewater effluent. To quantify each metal ion of interest, the output of multiple dyes is analyzed to provide accurate identification of specific metals.  Rigid attachment to the sensing platform allows for longer-term deployment.  Specifically, this project intends to demonstrate and evaluate the response of a sensor array to several heavy metals identified, based on customer surveys, as the primary analytical needs of the wastewater industry. This effort will include the quantification of relevant metal ions and an evaluation of the stability of those measurements over time in several flow systems which will be assembled.  A viable sensing platform prototype is envisioned at the end of a successful project.  Moving forward, further dyes can be added to allow quantification of other metals over the concentration ranges of interest, with minimal interference.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop an intracellular delivery technology for positively charged peptides for use in cell experiments in basic laboratory science and for delivery of peptide therapeutics for treatment of human disease. Peptides hold many advantages over the small molecule drugs that dominate the current healthcare market in terms of potency, specificity, and biocompatibility, and they are faster and easier to implement than genetic modifications for completion of hypothesis-driven studies. Peptides can inhibit enzymes and alter protein-protein interactions to have profound effects on cellular behavior. Despite these advantages, peptides suffer from poor intracellular uptake and entrapment within intracellular compartments, thereby preventing access to their intracellular target and limiting their potential as research tools and therapeutics. Positively charged cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) will be used to improve peptide uptake by cells.  The proposed polyplex peptide delivery technology is designed to be a user-friendly reagent that further enhances CPP peptide uptake and dramatically improves potency and durability of action by enabling escape from intracellular compartments. The polyplex technology will fill this current gap in the delivery reagent market, bolstering peptide use and accelerating scientific advancement, and also enable peptide therapeutic approaches for intracellular targets.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to leverage the properties of an anionic pH-responsive polymer to provide a more cost-effective, easy-to-use peptide delivery reagent that increases peptide uptake and longevity of action without cellular toxicity. The proposed work is focused on achieving the following aims: 1) Optimize a standardized formulation protocol that is effective for a broad range of peptides modified with positively charged cell-penetrating peptides by analyzing the physicochemical properties of a library of peptide-reagent formulations. 2) Verify polyplex-mediated peptide delivery efficiency as assessed by cellular peptide uptake across a broad spectrum of cell types, including both adherent and suspension cells as well as hard-to-transfect primary cell lines. 3) Establish advantages over competing delivery reagents in terms of ease of use, potency, duration of intracellular retention, and activity and biocompatibility. These aims will be achieved through the use of dynamic light scattering analysis, flow cytometric analysis of peptide uptake and retention, microscopy-based analysis of intracellular peptide localization, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Successful completion of these studies will establish the commercial viability of the peptide delivery reagent and enable the subsequent development of a prototype reagent kit for field testing.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop an automated composite lamination
    kitting and stitching machine.  This demonstration machine will be capable of
    placing, cutting and securing 6 layers of dry composite material in parallel.
    \ The parallel nature of the process greatly improves manufacturing time, while
    the reel-to-reel capable layout of the machine allows for manufacturing of long
    continuous laminates using a comparatively small machine footprint.  The key technical
    hurdles will be software control and mechanical management of multiple parallel
    plies.  During this research project Green Dynamics will demonstrate the proposed
    machine control proposal and mechanical system layout, which allows multiple plies
    to spool in parallel and be cut on individual gantries simultaneously.  The Green
    Dynamics lamination kitting and stitching machine will demonstrate the labor and
    cost savings that can be achieved through automated manufacturing of a single
    piece laminate.  These savings will enable the continued reduction in cost for
    composite materials, and spur their growth into new markets. Decreasing the cost
    and improving the quality of composite structures such as wind turbine blades
    and automotive components is a key path to lower carbon emissions. \n\n\nThe proposed
    manufacturing machine handles multiple fabric rolls in parallel and uses proprietary
    control algorithms and fabric handling methods to cut and secure up to 6 layers
    of material simultaneously. As individual layers are processed independently the
    resulting laminate stack is highly tailored and places material only where it
    is needed. The final product is transportable, and for very long length parts,
    can be rolled up to minimize transport size. At the manufacturing location this
    laminate is placed in the tool in a single step, which greatly reduces the time
    to manufacture the part and the process time in the tool. No other composite automation
    machine can provide a single piece lamination which is tailored in multiple directions.
    The resulting laminate effectively uses the orthotropic properties of composite
    materials to achieve lower weights while enabling much lower touch labor rates.
    The multi-roll, linear orientation of our machine allows for reel to reel processing
    of long narrow laminates in a small machine footprint, and results in a rolled,
    transportable laminate."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will create a proof of concept prototype
    of a Virtual Clinical Training Environment to emulate in-person clinical training.
    \ This transformative initiative, built with game technology and clinical algorithms,
    will enable students to safely practice clinical decision making as part of their
    medical school curriculum without impacting actual patients.  Schools can improve
    clinical competency across all medical training (medical, nurse practitioner,
    physician assistant, nurse, and allied healthcare students) without adding IT
    infrastructure or more staff.  Clinician trainees interact with virtual clinicians
    and patients in lifelike scenarios where they make decisions and receive expert
    mentoring feedback as they work to solve the scenario. These virtual experiences
    will be developed with well-respected medical school partners, and housed in an
    innovative Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for medical schools to access
    via a cost-effective subscription model on mobile devices and computers.  This
    proposed project will demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility by creating
    a proof of concept pilot with a prominent medical school collaborator. This platform
    will ultimately serve medical schools and teaching hospitals (over 400 in the
    United States alone), over 1900 nursing programs, and eventually hospital systems
    nationwide to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce errors - all without increasing
    their IT infrastructure or simulation center staff.  \n\nThis project will leverage
    unique, advanced software technology and engineering to create computer-based
    virtual clinical training environments that provide more authentic, complex, lifelike
    clinical training experiences on any device at any time. Delivering this level
    of functionality through a cost-effective SaaS model to mobile devices is uncharted
    territory.  Enabling conversational 3D virtual characters to dynamically respond
    to a user?s decisions via underlying logic is complex, and the feasibility of
    doing so within the constraints of web browsers running on mobile devices is unknown.
    Syandus' unique approach combines the responsiveness of game engine technology,
    the clinical decision making of systems engineering, and the effectiveness of
    experience-driven learning methodologies. This project will demonstrate technical
    and commercial feasibility in three objectives. First, Syandus' simulation technology
    expertise will be leveraged to build a technical proof of concept with acceptable
    performance on mobile devices. Second, a collaboration with a prominent medical
    school will result in the first virtual clinical training prototype using the
    technical proof of concept. Third, the functional requirements to best integrate
    these virtual experiences into the curriculum will be addressed with medical school
    advisors. The resulting platform will allow future modules to be built with medical
    school collaborators to create exceptional virtual experiences that fill the most
    significant clinical reasoning gaps in training.  Analytics will provide rich
    virtual decision data to learn how to improve learning effectiveness and outcomes."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a working prototype for an interactive search and visualization tool that redefines how social scientists and business practitioners interested in scholarly research findings identify such findings. Instead of reading through numerous, unstructured, and often irrelevant text results (such as those produced by traditional academic search engines), users get to (a) instantly view and easily navigate research findings via intuitively-structured, clickable visual maps, and (b) accurately identify those papers most relevant to them, thanks to semantically intelligent indexing and visual reconciliation. This efficiency-enhancing tool makes research findings substantially easier to understand and explore, while drastically cutting down search times for such findings (to half or even less) which will ultimately enhance the efficiency of research endeavors at U.S. universities. Moreover, various inquiries have shown that practitioners in applied fields such as marketing or management place high value on academic research in the social sciences, yet often find such research difficult to understand. The proposed solution distills social science findings into an easily digestible format, hence facilitating the knowledge transfer between academia and businesses, and enhancing the value of academic research to society. Finally, by being marketed as a subscription-based service to both academics and business practitioners, the proposed tool has the potential to generate substantial commercial value in the long term (up to $50 million in annual revenue).

    The proposed tool fundamentally alters the existing search paradigm in the social sciences, by changing both the way in which research findings from academic papers are indexed, and how such findings are visually presented. It combines an innovation on the back-end (i.e., using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to automatically extract concepts and causal relationships from academic research papers, and semantically categorize those concepts against a set of discipline-specific thesauri) with an innovation on the front-end (i.e., using aggregate causal mapping to represent the academic literature in the form of interactive maps that can be visually explored and narrowed down in order to precisely locate relevant papers). The main research objective is to test the feasibility of (1) using NLU for accurately identifying and extracting the underlying concepts/variables and causal structure of the studies described in a large set of social science research papers (approximately 1,000 published papers), and of (2) automatically rendering the extracted information in the form of causal maps that both academic and non-academic users can intuitively understand and navigate. This research objective has been reached if a group of test users employ the proposed tool to successfully identify research papers examining particular concepts and relationships, and do so in about half the time needed when using a traditional academic search engine for the same task.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project revolves around the democratization of extremely complex motion generation, perception, and control systems. Most roboticists today program without understanding heat transfer, motor controllers, and lowlevel
    message passing. Abstractions improve robot accessibility and enable organizations to leverage a broader range of expertise. This project will further the modern robotics abstraction to obviate specialized knowledge of low level task processes such as movement and vision across a variety of robots. Product driven companies are best suited to develop business logic and a thoughtful customer
    experience, and most struggle to acquire suitable in-house talent to remain competitive with foundational robotics techniques. This system addresses fundamental behavioral prerequisites for applications ranging from collaborative robotics in manufacturing and fulfillment to assistive robotics, caretaking, and personal home robotics as well as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
    autonomous vehicles, and entertainment robots. With higher level interfaces, programmers can more easily leverage their creativity and intuition enabling a new generation of applications unhindered by the present day difficulties of low level development. Beyond the commercial potential, these advantages are pervasive: researchers, students, and children alike, of all genders and ethnicities, will be empowered to interact with, program, and study robots at a substantially higher level.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the increasing need for a higher level interface to robots that abstracts away perception, motion generation, and control. Many competing techniques for motion generation and perception populate the literature, but recently optimization has become a common unifying theme playing a prominent role in continuously running and adapting behavior with the promise of speed and generality. This project will utilize state of the art technology in continuous motion optimization and modern real time vision and tracking techniques to build an integrated system appropriate for use across multiple robots. These techniques involve optimization, Riemannian geometry, low level control, online learning and more&#894; many components are well suited to generalizing across robotic platforms, but questions remain regarding processing speed, robustness, and the utility of
    existing modeling tools. This project will assess the viability of such a higher level system by studying the latencies of reactions, precision of manipulation, and its long term robustness especially in the context of collaborative robotics for manufacturing using evaluations across multiple physical robotic platforms. The technical results will illuminate the role of optimization in
    motion generation and perception for real world productionizable systems and uncover any remaining scientific question that must be addressed.

    This SBIR Phase I project will enable the development of a game-based, mobile cross-cutting physics and chemistry application for students in grades 9-12. In 2011 the National Research Council (NRC) published the final framework for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The NGSS, which have been adopted by 17 states and the District of Columbia, place an emphasis on cross-cutting science, technology, math and engineering (STEM) concepts, but these concepts are often not yet incorporated in 9-12 grade curriculum. By leveraging the intrinsic appeal and intuitive nature of interactive media for learning, this project aims to address this gap, engendering student engagement with a learn-by-doing approach that incorporates problem solving and rewards student progress. Interactive media, specifically game-based learning, is beginning to gain momentum in classrooms as a complement to teacher-led instruction. The engagement of more young people in science is critical for our nation, both to create informed citizens and to properly prepare the next generation of skilled professionals. In addition to directly creating several jobs for skilled US citizens, the efforts of this project will contribute to a commercially viable mobile application for an educational technologies industry that is currently valued at $1.5 billion per annum and growing.

    This project will focus on radiant energy, including its physical attributes, how these attributes interact with the natural world (chemical, biological, geological, astronomical), and how radiant energy is harnessed for engineering and technological applications. This will lead students to think about real-world scenarios and learn how the natural connectivity of STEM will enable them to formulate a broad mental lattice which emphasizes the deep relationships within the biological, physical, and mathematical worlds. Light in the broad sense is electromagnetic radiant energy and includes radio waves, UV irradiation, visible light, gamma rays. Regardless of which type it is, the speed of light is the same, c, = 2.9979245Å~108 m s-1. This connection is often lost on students as there is no suitable way of teaching this in the classroom. In concert with the NGSS and the powerful potential of interactive applications in modeling complex systems, this project will give educators a tool to communicate these concepts using a hands-on approach. This innovation is based on evidence that active participation in learning can increase information retention rates by as much as 45% when compared to traditional lecture or audiovisual teaching techniques. In addition, the element of gamification further increases student engagement and sense of achievement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a commercially feasible, drug-releasing contact lens for treatment of glaucoma. Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, was estimated to affect 64 million people world-wide in 2013. This is expected to rise to approximately 112 million affected individuals by 2040. The primary treatment is topical eye drops that patients must self-administer at least once per day. These eye drops provide a very short (a few minutes) burst of drug exposure to the cornea, with more than 90% of the drug being washed away. Furthermore, poor patient compliance with this tedious daily application accounts for substantial worsening of disease and increased healthcare costs. This SBIR project will develop a new glaucoma treatment standard that overcomes the many shortfalls of topical eye drops, resolving issues of drug absorption and patient compliance with targeted and controlled drug delivery (better absorption) and extended wear (less tedious, better compliance). If successful, this approach could serve as a platform technology for innovating future ocular treatments.

    The proposed project solves key issues that currently hinder the adequate pharmaceutical treatment of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. The goal of this SBIR project is to utilize specially designed drug-carrying nanoparticles to achieve a near constant rate of delivery from a contact lens to the cornea. These "smart" nanoparticles, which will be integrated into contact lens formulations, will respond to the microenvironment of the tear film to trigger a sustained release of the drug. Comparing with the common eye drops, the glaucoma treatment via contact lens is anticipated to achieve a sustainable drug delivery at a near constant rate, higher bioavailability (much higher than 5%), and with substantially reduced risk of unintended systemic toxicity.

    a precedence for remote, real time assessment of the safety and serviceability
    of infrastructural assets through the development of a self-powered structural
    health monitoring system. This piezoelectric fatigue fuse (PFF) will enable the
    establishment of quantifiable metrics to discern the current state of life as
    well as projected lifetimes and reparability criteria for assets ranging from
    bridges, to oil platforms, to ship hulls, and optimistically to any steel structures
    where fatigue is the primary mode of failure. With the remotely accessible, real

    regarding visual and other nondestructive inspection frequency and thereby reduce
    overall cost of maintenance, inspection and operation.  Over the course of the
    design and evaluation of the sensors, an assessment of the underlying effects
    of fatigue crack nucleation and propagation through designed stress concentrations
    in coupled electromechanical systems will be performed.  This work will illuminate
    the material and geometric constraints necessary to optimize piezoelectric transducers
    to provide adequate power and robust signal to noise ratios for fatigue sensing
    under real world, dynamic spectrum loading scenarios.   \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project to design and develop a piezoelectric
    fatigue fuse aims to address the growing problem of transit asset management in
    the United States. The recent series of bridge failures in the US exemplifies
    the public safety risks of ageing infrastructure and    without a method to inspect
    and monitor fatigue in steel structures with improved accuracy and efficiency,
    the safety and serviceability of these structures is at an ever-increasing risk.
    The aim of developing and introducing PFF?s is to provide a measure of loading
    history that correlates with fatigue crack growth to predict current state-of-life
    and dictate economic options for future inspection and repair frequency. This
    will be accomplished by developing a system which transduces the mechanical loading
    of a structure into electrical energy which is simultaneously used to charge low-power
    electronics and generate digital data corresponding to the fatigue life of the
    asset. The key technical results of this program will be the measured electrical
    response of optimized PFF sensors, an understanding of signal modulation as the
    mechanical fuses accrue fatigue damage and the requirements of the low power electronics
    and radios necessary to make these systems truly self-powered."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a commercially-viable human cell-based model to screen experimental drugs for their efficacy in treating myelin disorders. Current screening methods used in the R&D of new drugs fail to successfully predict translation from discovery to clinical success. This absence results in high attrition rates, increased development time, and significant R&D costs, most acutely in neurological applications. Pharmaceutical companies devote up to 15 years and spend over $2B to bring a single drug to market. On average, 89% of drugs entering clinical trials fail, while drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS) fail at a rate of 92%, due largely to the poor predictive validity of current animal models. As a case study of demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States and 2.5 million people worldwide. MS therapeutics represent a $17.2B global market, with an estimated late-stage preclinical testing market of $50M annually. Development of the proposed screening platform has the potential to better predict clinical efficacy, while substantially reducing the time and cost associated with developing new drugs for MS and other demyelinating disorders, accelerating treatments for millions of patients.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to establish the technical feasibility of using a 3D model of living nerve/brain tissue for screening drugs to treat disorders of myelin, the fatty encasement surrounding nerve axons. The project aims to build on preliminary work to include cells relevant to the central nervous system. It will then be shown that myelination, demyelination, and remyelination can be assessed using clinically-relevant, physiological metrics. The final goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a humanized assay, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, a renewable source of human cells. The resultant model system will be truly unique, comprised of human cells in an anatomical arrangement that mimics living nerve tissue, unlocking the potential for clinically-relevant metrics far earlier in the drug development lifecycle.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a cutting-edge nanotechnology
    that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such
    as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential
    to changing regenerative healthcare forever. It would change biobanking for on-demand
    cells and tissues and improve mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical
    procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all
    levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment
    of a final product to patient. Yet, critically, the field lacks the ability to
    safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines severely limiting
    product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable
    than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient
    (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or
    transport distances. More people will die from premature organ failure than cancer.
    \ Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will
    significantly enhance national healthcare.  The US faces strong commercial and
    competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including
    organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant
    savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies
    with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly
    $250 billion per year in the U.S.\n  \n\nThe cytotoxicity of current biopreservation
    techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water
    delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage
    from ice formation. The goal of this project is to establish a fundamentally different
    approach to cryoprotective agent optimization by developing first-in-the-field
    bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient
    intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation.
    Past research has demonstrated the reliability of constructing well-defined nanotubular
    assemblies via the enforced stacking of shape-persistent macrocycles based on
    the interplay of multiple hydrogen-bonding, dipole-dipole, and aromatic pi-pi
    stacking interactions and their self-insertion into lipid bilayers. These rationally
    designed organic nanopores will serve as selective transmembrane channels when
    protein channels malfunction at or below 3 °C. As a result, the cell's exposure
    time to reach ice-free cryopreservation temperature will be significantly reduced.
    Post-preservation cell yield and viability will be greatly improved by reducing
    intracellular ice formation. Upon rewarming, these organic nanopores will facilitate
    rapid removal of the cryoprotective agents. At physiological temperature, the
    nanopores will seal off, and be washed out from the system resulting in low toxicity.
    Nanopore function and effect will be examined using liposome-based glucose transport,
    cell-based toxicity and cell-based cryopreservation assays."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the development of a piezoelectric energy harvesting fiber to autonomously power sensors and other low-power electronics in smart garments. This technology will allow the fabrication of garments with seamlessly integrated energy harvesting systems, as opposed to today's rigid electronics, to enable smart garments to move toward the same breathability, fit and comfort as normal clothing. The smart garments market is forecast to continue growing at nearly 20% per year over the next several years, reaching $2 billion by 2018. While there has been significant publicity around the development of smart garments for measuring various physiological conditions of athletes, the broader impact of this technology includes applications for monitoring soldiers, emergency responders and patients where the loss of sensor power (e.g. for body function monitoring or environmental sensing) could be dire. While this project will focus on one particular fiber chemistry, the expected learning that will result in terms of fiber processing and integration into fabric structures will also be applicable to other fiber technologies.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with understanding the behavior of fiber-based piezoelectrics as they are processed into yarns and fabrics. Historically, ceramic and polymer piezoelectric materials are used in rigid or flexible film forms, which are not suitable for the development of wearable textile-based technologies. This effort focuses on a new class of piezoelectric polymer fiber, poly(gamma-benzyl-alpha,L-glutamate) (ePBLG), than can be produced in a single electrospinning process and without the need for physical or chemical post-processing to yield its piezo-activity. The three primary goals of the work will be: understanding the effect of polymer and process conditions on fiber dielectric properties, assessing and optimizing the mechanical and dielectric properties of ePBLG yarns, and evaluating the electrical output of a variety of orthogonal electrodes, as would be appropriate for woven fabric constructions. Through this work we will determine the effects on power output when transforming the ePBLG material into structures required for seamless incorporation into smart garments. With this knowledge, the piezoelectric power supply can be properly sized for the balance-of-system within a specific smart garment design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its capability to create a positive impact for every wireless system. This project concentrates on the antenna element along with control algorithms and targets commercial wireless communication applications, i.e., 5G cellular small cells. As any wireless platform uses an antenna, an advancement accomplished for this element will create a positive impact for every wireless system. For example, the tactical military antennas must not only have reduced size, signature and cost, but must also ensure that maximum efficiency, dynamic mutual coupling tolerance and coverage area are achievable at all times, for any frequency and in any kind of environment. The proposed multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology with dynamically changeable properties is ideal for military and commercial antenna applications. Society will benefit from the increased array of applications of wireless networks driven by the proposed innovative design principles and MRA technologies. This project also has a strong educational component and will provide excellent opportunities to train students at undergraduate and graduate levels in interdisciplinary fields that combine wireless communication theory, antenna design, and fabrication technologies. If successful, this project will significantly enhance accessing the wireless spectrum.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project targets to revolutionize the way wireless communication is performed by developing a new class of antenna technology called multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA). The frequency band, radiation pattern and polarization properties of an antenna directly impact the coverage, capacity, and quality of service achieved by wireless networks. Particularly, 5G and beyond wireless systems must employ multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology to attain improved spectral efficiency, advanced interference management capability, higher network capacities and energy efficiencies with reduced cost, size and weight. However, achievement of this represents a significant challenge particularly if the MIMO systems use legacy antenna technology, which has not seen much change since the invention of antennas more than 100 years ago. The intelligence of these systems is limited to adaptive signal processing, which are optimized in isolation independent from antenna properties that are assumed fixed. The proposed MRA technology enables a single antenna element to dynamically change its properties, thereby the joint optimization of all system parameters (environment, EM wave properties, and communication algorithms). Success on this frontier has the potential to revolutionize the antenna systems in terms of agility, performance, power consumption, cost, and size.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies primarily in its contribution to the rehabilitation robotics, assistive technologies and collaborative robotics fields. Technologists engaged in developing devices and products in these fields are greatly benefiting from the lower prices of electronics brought on by the growth of the telecommunications industry, but those same technologists don?t have ready access to compliantly controlled actuators that make physical robot-human interaction safe. Developing such actuators is costly, it takes a long time, and it requires very specific and rare expertise.  The introduction of a new line of inexpensive (as compared to existing technologies), highly backdrivable linear actuators onto the market will enable a new breed of robotic rehabilitation and assistive products, as well as co-robots and perhaps even gaming interfaces with haptic feedback.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a proof of concept of the compliant force control module (CFCM), for converting simple linear screw-driven actuators into highly backdrivable, force-controlled actuators.  There is great interest and opportunity in co-robots, but in order for these devices to safely manipulate objects and interact haptically with humans, they must be inherently safe.  Compliant force-controlled actuators can render such co-robots safe, but due to their novelty such equipment is not commercially available.  A proprietary force sensor design will be implemented and research will be performed on various methods for achieving high performance with sufficient stability margins in both hardware and software.  Research will be performed on control algorithm approaches for minimizing the effects of mechanical play, stiction and inertia.  The use of visco-elastic materials as the compliant element to replace the purely elastic elements (springs) will be investigated for the potential to mitigate the mechanical issues found in economical mechanical transmissions.  The ultimate goal of the proposed effort is to demonstrate the improved force-control performance of an off-the-shelf linear actuator when equipped with the CFCM technology.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be to increase wood production of managed loblolly
    pine tree farms by 20%. Global demand for forest industry products, e.g., pulp
    for paper, saw timber, and wood pellets for fuel, is expected to rise 60-100%
    by 2060. As the world's 4th largest exporter of forest products, the U.S. is well
    positioned to help meet these growing needs. To do so, managed loblolly pine tree
    farms will play a large role in supplying the demand. Using a biotechnology gene
    trait approach to introduce cell wall gene technology, the goal is to engineer
    pine trees with 20% more wood density over conventional crops. This may result
    in more wood material per tree, per acre with no added cost to production processing,
    i.e., no increase use of land, water, or fertilizers. As an added benefit, bioengineered
    trees with cell wall gene technologies aid in protecting the environment by sequestering
    more atmospheric CO2 thus helping to combat the negative effects of global climate
    change. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of renewable materials
    needed to meet societal needs while helping to protect the environment.   \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) I project proposes to evaluate
    the use of a biotechnology gene trait approach to bioengineer loblolly pine for
    high wood density by modifying secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed
    research would utilize a newly adapted pine transformation protocol to introduce
    cell wall gene platform technologies, together with ubiquitously expressed and
    secondary wall-specific promoters, to significantly and selectively increase cell
    wall density in loblolly pine. Bioengineered plants will be selected using herbicide
    resistance and the effects of transgene incorporation analyzed through gene expression
    and histochemical analysis. The anticipated outcome of this project will be 400
    bioengineered pine seedlings with greater strength and increased value to be tested
    in greenhouse and field trials once approved. This project will serve as proof-of-concept
    testing for select cell wall gene technologies in commercial tree crops towards
    technology commercialization."

    bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds
    of thousands of individuals in the US who suffer severe physical disability due
    to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such
    as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Due to improvements in emergency medicine and
    increasing average age in the society, these individuals represent a growing population
    that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program will be to develop a technology to convert the acid whey waste generated by Greek yogurt production into a natural sweetener. The Greek yogurt industry is on the rise. However, making authentic Greek yogurt is a wasteful process - producing 3 parts waste for every part of Greek yogurt made. An economical use of Greek yogurt waste will capture the full value of the waste materials, minimize waste transportation cost, decrease bacterial outbreak risk, and reduce the carbon footprint for the environment. In parallel, the technology will ensure a sustainable supply of a rare low-calorie natural sweetener, which was shown to help lower blood sugar and improve cholesterol levels, in addition to its antioxidant, anti-cavity and pro-digestive properties. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of conversion of non-food biomass to value-added chemicals.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to develop engineered yeast as a self-renewing biocatalyst for processing the environmentally hazardous waste from Greek yogurt production into a low-calorie natural sweetener. Greek yogurt companies struggle to dispose of its waste. The waste, which contains significant amounts of lactose, cannot be discarded without a pretreatment step because it stimulates bacterial growth, polluting water systems. The research addresses this challenge through the development of self-sustained microbes as catalysts in a continuous process, allowing lactose uptake with minimal waste pretreatment. This process produces a low-calorie natural sweetener as a product, whose market supply is currently limited by production cost. Anticipated technical results include strains with high yield and productivity, a specific product purification method and successful assembly of a live yeast reactor. The design overcomes substantial financial, logistical and thermodynamic bottlenecks in Greek yogurt waste treatment, and the low-calorie natural sweetener production.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be to commercialize novel sugar polymers known as
    glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) for a variety of important medical applications. GAGs
    are key components in a number of important physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions
    (e.g., tumor angiogenesis, thrombosis); however, developing a detailed understanding
    of these roles, which may significantly impact human health, is challenging due
    to a lack of analytical techniques for glycan analysis and the absence of high
    quality GAG samples available for research. GAGs have precise functional roles
    in cell signaling cascades, which can vary depending on the particular GAG structural
    composition. Particular GAG compositions vary among different tissue types as
    well as among different developmental and physiological states. Hence, to achieve
    the proper functional characteristics and obtain reproducible experimental results,
    it is critical that GAG samples are available with consistent and defined compositions.
    Unfortunately, most commercially available GAG samples are from animal sources
    with high inherent variability and are not well characterized. The potential for
    contamination or adventitious agents makes the animal-derived GAG samples even
    less desirable for human therapeutics. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes
    to develop genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells producing
    GAGs with defined compositions. Culture conditions will be optimized to maintain
    GAG composition while providing product yields at a level sufficient for commercialization.
    A series of engineered cell lines will be produced in order to prepare GAGs with
    different compositions that model the different compositions and different functional
    characteristics found in nature. GAG samples will be characterized both structurally
    and functionally to provide profiles for each type of sample, which will be reliable
    and reproducible since the GAGs are prepared from cells grown under controlled
    conditions. These samples will be a valuable resource for researchers in a number
    of biological and medical fields. It is thought that the high quality will command
    premium prices. However, to help reduce costs and promote commercialization, this
    proposal will test growth conditions in bioreactors to increase the capacity and
    efficiency of production.  Research using these high quality GAG samples will
    provide proof-of-principal for the use these GAGs in a variety of important therapeutic
    applications such as oncology, lipid metabolism, tissue regeneration, and hematology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to reduce pathogenic salmonella carriage in poultry. The challenge addressed is the one of foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections. These infections are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Of alarming concern is the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. A major source of drug-resistance development is the widespread use of antibiotics in animal production. An estimated 70% of all antibiotics produced in the US are administered to livestock, primarily to promote growth and improve feed efficiency, even in the absence of infection. This sub-therapeutic administration of antibiotics to animals creates a vast reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant bacteria.  As a potential solution to this problem, probiotic bacteria will be engineered that express and secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals. In this application, the focus is on chickens, a significant source of animal protein in diets around the globe. Foodborne Salmonella infects millions of people in the US every year, and the major source of Salmonella poisoning are poultry products. The goal is to reduce carriage of Salmonella in chickens to ensure safe food and reduce the need for antibiotics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess a new, transformative antibiotic technology. Antibiotic, AMP-producing probiotics will be used to reduce pathogens in poultry intestines. Pathogens in poultry intestines are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. AMPs are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. Probiotics will be tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be delivered safely in food or water. Synthetic biological DNA promoter regions will be employed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection. The impact of controllable AMP delivery will be examined in poultry challenged by Salmonella Enteritidis, a common foodborne pathogen. The impact will be examined for live biotherapeutic bacteria on the microbiota present in the GI tracts of poultry. This project will result in the following advances in discovery/development: 1) Discovery of antimicrobial peptides that selectively target Salmonella spp. 2) Development of peptide expression and secretion cassettes for probiotics; 3) Development of probiotics that competitively inhibit the growth of Salmonella spp.; 4) Development of probiotics that may be supplied safely to farm animals; and 5) Development of probiotics that positively modulate the gut microbiome of poultry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will a new type of liquid-handling robot.  Currently, most liquid handling in biology research is carried out manually. Due to the complexity and high cost of automated systems compared with the ease-of-use and low cost of manual instruments, automation primarily benefits a few industrial, high-throughput applications. However, new ideas and discoveries typically take place on a much smaller scale, and, thus, the tremendous impact, by way of repeatable science, promised by automation is diminished. This project provides an easy-to-use tool, priced on par with manual pipettors, which may have an immediate positive impact on biology research labs worldwide. By bringing repeatable protocols and reduced complexity to the market, this project will change the way biologists approach bench-top science, improving repeatability and the rate of innovation in the life sciences.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an automation platform for laboratory liquid handling based on a miniature liquid handling robot controlled by a new language to capture biological protocols.  It fits like a lid on the top of a microtiter plate, and it can accompany the plate for the duration of a days-long protocol, even in the incubator, and carry out all or most of the liquid-handling steps of the protocol. In addition, the accompanying software will be designed to improve reproducibility and record-keeping in bench biology work. The goal is to maintain precision volume dispensing while minimizing cross-contamination and providing continuous monitoring and liquid management in a miniature robot. This will require a robot moving precisely in four axes while constrained to the approximate volume of a cup of coffee. The software will be designed to create a general language for capturing biology protocols.  This project aims to improve laboratory standards and allow exchange of experiment designs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a comprehensive investigation into the feasibility of using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticle composite coating as a lubricant in ball bearings for washdown duty electric motors. The successful transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing has tremendous implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons by the end of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in manufacturing equipment. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for washdown duty electric motors is estimated to be $50 million, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the mechanical properties and adhesion of PTFE coatings through the use of an adhesive polymer basecoat and a nanoparticle filler within a PTFE topcoat. This reduces friction and increases wear-life, allowing PTFE coatings to be used in applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. Preliminary results show that the proposed coating exhibits a two thousand-fold improvement in wear-life over virgin PTFE. The goal of the proposed research and development work is the optimization of the coating chemical composition and deposition parameters to maximize the performance in rolling element applications. These parameters play a critical role in the wear, vibration, and friction that occurs in coated bearings. Benchtop tribological tests will be performed to measure these properties under accelerated wear testing conditions and provide feedback during the optimization process. A thorough understanding of the process-structure-property relationship of the proposed coating will lead to new scientific knowledge which will be disseminated through applicable journals and trade publications. The successful completion of the proposed work will result in PTFE-lubricated ball bearings with a wear-life which is more than 50% improved as compared to grease-lubricated bearings.

    world.\n \nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project introduces
    the key insight that the power-hungry, high-frequency analog and RF components
    found in battery-powered radios can be grouped together into a wall-powered device
    called the helper node. The energy constrained, battery-powered mobile/embedded
    endpoint device contains only low frequency and mostly digital components, making
    its power consumption negligible. The mobile devices transmit data by reflecting
    RF signals generated by the helper. This novel partitioning of the radio system
    allows the Endpoint to communicate far more efficiently than was possible with
    active radio techniques. This project aims to create a complete network stack
    that enables passive devices to coexist with conventional active devices in the
    ISM band. The system consists of ultra-low energy endpoint sensors, wall-powered
    helper devices, and commercial off the shelf active radio routers. The project
    involves building working networking hardware, designing and implementing a network
    stack matched to the project?s unique needs, and testing the resulting system
    with real customers.  If successful, the project will have delivered the critical
    enabling technology for the vision of pervasively connected devices with billions
    of devices connected to the Internet without the need to replace batteries."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to enhance the supply of complex pharmaceutical molecules
    from nature. Over 60% of current drugs are natural products, or are derived from
    natural products, and of these approximately half are from plants. The therapeutic
    activity of a given plant molecule is encoded in its chemical structure, which
    is biosynthesized by a specialized metabolic pathway. Despite the efficiency of
    these biosyntheses, plants accumulate relatively small amounts of the potent metabolites
    in specialized cells and tissue types, thereby restricting the availability of
    essential medicines from plants. The opioids exemplify this limitation of plant
    therapeutics; the structural complexity of the opioids precludes chemical synthesis
    at commercial scale, and in the absence of this synthetic source the only viable
    alternative is to extract natural opiates from opium poppy. This project proposes
    to make the biosynthesis of medicinal opioids possible in a microbial host. This
    synthetic biology approach will move opioid production into fermentation facilities
    and free up the 100,000 hectares of arable land used each year for poppy crops.
    The disruptive technology resulting from this research will for the first time
    provide for a local, scalable, secure supply of medicinal opioids.   \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a microbial production system for medicinal
    opioids that will displace the existing supply from opium poppies. A complete
    opioid biosynthesis pathway was recently constructed in Baker's yeast, demonstrating
    that this technology holds enormous potential for supplying the $2B opioid active
    pharmaceutical ingredient (API) market. The key technical hurdle addressed in
    this SBIR project is to enhance the activity of rate-limiting enzymes that catalyze
    key steps in the construction of the five-ring opioid scaffold. The target class
    of plant enzymes is poorly expressed in heterologous hosts such as yeast and must
    be membrane localized. The proposed research takes three approaches to support
    these enzymes: 1) tuning expression to conserve the endomembrane environment and
    promote activity, 2) constructing N-terminal chimeric proteins with enhanced stability,
    and 3) identifying partner enzymes that support the catalytic function of these
    enzymes. The goal is to remove the bottleneck steps in existing production strains
    to allow for commercially-relevant titers of greater than 1 g/L. The outcome will
    be a new production system that offers active pharmaceutical ingredients at lower
    cost, with greater availability and variety of molecules, shorter lead times,
    and acute responsiveness to the medical demand for opioid therapeutics."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is improvement in cost-efficiency, energy-efficiency, and quality in manufacturing automation, increasing worker productivity and reducing repetitive motion injuries. This integrated visual-tactile system will be 3-4 times more inexpensive ($20,000 purchase cost vs. existing $65,000-80,000 vision system), improve the speed and accuracy of current robotic handling systems, and facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks. By enabling new robotic applications and increasing productivity in current automation, this solution will help the U.S. maintain a competitive domestic manufacturing sector.  In 2009 there were 36,190 logged repetitive motion injuries in the U.S.; the median missed work time from these injuries was 21 days (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).  This innovative solution will facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks and greatly improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of current robotic handling systems.  The immediate commercial applications are in industrial robotics, specifically robotics in agile manufacturing. In the long term, the technology will be applied in personal, healthcare, and military robots. The current market potential for tactile sensors for industrial robots is estimated as $576 million - $1.15 billion and expected to more than double by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in a combined visual-tactile system that will give robots an integrated sense of touch and vision, much like the hand-eye coordination of humans. It incorporates a technically novel compliant tactile sensing solution?a rubber ?skin? that can be molded into any form factor and is inexpensive and durable.  This advanced skin technology can resolve object shape, contact/slip events, and forces of contacted objects.  It will uniquely fuse visual and tactile information for object handling and pose estimation resulting in flexible robotic system that handles objects more like humans do.  This approach addresses key weaknesses in vision-based robotic manufacturing, such as occlusion and dislodging when parts are grasped.  Current industrial robots are restricted in their ability to handle small, irregularly shaped, soft, or fragile parts. Existing solutions rely on expensive and complex 3D-vision systems or repetitive manual labor. This solution is two-fold: (1) A new flexible tactile sensor that can be tailored to a wide variety of form factors; (2) Software to fuse the tactile data with a vision system to estimate pose of objects in pick-and-place tasks.

    the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans
    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical
    machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing
    and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry
    with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational
    awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create
    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the
    national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example
    of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software
    platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability,
    and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible
    for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused
    on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications,
    such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic
    dredging and excavation."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to enable affordable detection and enrichment of rare DNA or RNA molecules from a large background population. Currently, such detection is performed on expensive, dedicated instruments that have low sensitivity and are not able to enrich. The strategy is to encapsulate the fluorescently-identified target molecules in thin oil shells so that they mimic cells, and then process them on sensitive and high-throughput cell-sorting instruments that are commonly available. By offloading the detection and enrichment to such machines, all that is required by researchers is a simple tool that encapsulates the molecules in thin oil shells. Applications made possible by high sensitivity and enrichment are numerous, from rare pathogen or cell detection to target capture of uncommon mutant sequences with the goal of downstream sequencing. Between the reduced cost and expansion of capabilities, this approach is likely to become a widely adopted method.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a deployable instrument that allows high-throughput, low-cost quantitation of DNA/RNA molecules in a sample by interfacing with existing flow cytometry instruments. The initial objective is to quickly engineer all the functionality desired in that final instrument into a rough alpha version. Its features will include reliable droplet generation from iteratively optimized hard-plastic microfluidic chips, and automation via an advanced fluid handling system with precise feedback control. The second objective is to build the actual beta version for customer trials. The beta version will replace most of the off-the-shelf parts with streamlined, custom engineering and focus on reducing size and cost while still improving function through more iterative chip optimization. The final objective is to use the beta instrument to optimize the protocols and reagents for several applications using customer samples and benchmarking. At the conclusion of the project, the goal is to have instruments at customer sites generating data.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in bringing epoxy based conductive polymer
    anticorrosion paint system to the market. Corrosion will cost the US economy over
    $1 trillion in 2015. It is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion
    technologies to reduce this huge economic cost of corrosion. The most effective
    anticorrosion pigments in use today are based on heavy metal pigments, such as
    chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds. Environmental, health, and
    safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments. The proposed
    new product will not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based
    anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection.
    The project is especially targeting replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer
    coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures.
    Solving the poor processibility of environmentally friendly conductive polymers
    should enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings
    such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static
    resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. \n\n\nThe intellectual
    merit of the proposed project lies in using advanced knowledge and understanding
    of anticorrosion coatings. It is generally assumed that organic coatings act as
    barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface. But corrosion
    of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that relates to both cations
    and anions. The present proposal suggests developing an ion barrier anticorrosion
    coating system: conductive polymer nanoparticle pigmented epoxy primer with a
    topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both
    anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore,
    provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal. This system will not use
    heavy metal anticorrosion pigments any more. If present proposed research succeeds,
    it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating provides corrosion protection to
    a metal substrate, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enablement of new and improved therapeutic drug development.  One hurdle in the development of new drugs, is their relatively low effectiveness due to poor water solubility limiting formulation choices and/or limiting cellular uptake.  Forming drug nano particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool to overcome this low solubility hurdle.   Acoustical energy has been shown to aid in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution needed for many new drug candidates.  A reliable method for nanoparticle drug production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market.  Additionally, the Pharmaceutical industry is transitioning from batch to continuous flow manufacturing processes.  This has significant impact on cost, responsiveness, and quality control of the drug supply chain, and will enable more rapid and lower cost drug development and manufacturing.

    The proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the continuous manufacture of drug nano and micron sized particles by controlling the crystallization using a novel focused acoustical field.  Focused acoustics has the advantage of delivering a highly efficient, controllable, scalable energy field to the crystallization zone.  The project will demonstrate a focused acoustics crystallization process capable of being developed into commercial grade equipment suitable for use in a continuous flow production pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

    The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.

    the public health and meanwhile create commercial values to the industry. In the
    food and supplement industries, this technology may enable the industry to replace
    non-healthy or even hazardous additives, such as artificial colors and preservatives,
    with natural and healthy alternatives, thus greatly contribute to long-term food
    safety and security as well as public health. To achieve commercialization success,
    a solid portfolio of intellectual properties has been established. Seasoned business

    this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble
    active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a
    long time. For example, around 80% of drug candidates identified by modern drug
    discovery technologies are poorly water-soluble. For food, a large number of vitamins,
    nutrients, antioxidants, and natural colors are poorly water-soluble. Overall,
    poorly water-soluble compounds constitute an enormous formulation challenge. To
    address this need, this team has created a platform technology that is highly
    effective and non-specific. The goal of this project is to further develop the
    technology, scale up the synthesis of a core material, obtain the data on its
    safety profile, and advance the commercialization activities by providing prototypes
    to potential customers. This project will be conducted through close collaborations
    among the start-up company, a major university, and a number of major pharmaceutical,
    ingredients, food, and personal care companies. The deliverables of this project
    include the specifications of core material, initial safety evaluations, and prototypes
    provided to customers. This project will support the start-up company to form
    a solid foundation for commercialization and long-term growth."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve the quality and decrease the high costs associated with treating patients who suffer severe traumatic brain injuries. This project aims to develop an accurate, affordable (<$100 per use) and non-invasive device to monitor a patient's intracranial pressure following head injury. Increased intracranial pressure can result in poor health outcomes including long-term disability or death, if left untreated. However, the only available method to monitor intracranial pressure is expensive (~$10,000 per patient) and requires neurosurgery. The lack of a method to accurately screen patients to determine who needs surgery results in misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in about 46% of patients among an estimated 50,000 patients in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally. Successful commercialization of product is expected to result in savings in the range $250 million ever year to the US healthcare system.

    The proposed project will develop a medical device to accurately display a patient's intracranial pressure non-invasively and for use outside of the neurocritical care unit. The core technological approach of the proposed work is the analysis of blood flow velocity waveforms using advanced signal processing methods in a machine-learning framework. The machine-learning framework allows experience-based learning utilizing prior, established databases of waveforms that have been well-characterized. Three new machine-learning paradigms that utilize the shape features of the blood flow velocity waveforms will be utilized to progressively increase accuracy of intracranial pressure estimation. The first will establish a basic estimate using shape features of individual waveform pulses, considered independent of neighboring pulses. Subsequently, clinically established features of the waveform will be utilized to learn causal changes in the shape features resulting from changes in intracranial pressure. Finally, the shape features in successive pulses will be used as a sequence to machine-learn the intracranial pressure estimate. Together, these will enable increased accuracy in estimation. All of the methods proposed in this program are entirely novel. This approach allows for real time monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement limits for ultrasonography procedures.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a computer-based tutoring platform that adapts its teaching strategy to each student by monitoring their brain activity.  Access to individualized instruction by teachers or qualified tutors is limited for a vast number of students, particularly in disadvantaged areas and for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.  Computer-based teaching technology could meet this demand, but currently relies on indirect inferences of a student's state, and therefore lacks some of the key abilities of human teachers to assess a student during a lesson.  This project will address this challenge by enabling the tutoring system to determine how hard students are thinking and their level of focus. This will be accomplished by measuring a student's brain electrical activity using a newly-developed headset designed specifically for school-aged children.  Information derived from brain activity patterns will be used to guide tutorial topic selection, difficulty of the content and the level of interactivity.  This project could lead to a significant advance in education technology by enhancing the adaptability of computer-based tutoring platforms and expanding the depth of information on student performance available to teachers and parents.  Adaptive computer-based education is now a rapidly growing market, and the technology developed in this project aims to provide companies with a unique capability to improve their products and to meet the need for truly scalable individualized tutoring.

    The unique innovation of this project is to create a tutoring platform that closes the loop with the student by adapting its teaching strategy to the student?s cognitive state.  To overcome the limitations of current adaptive tutoring systems, this product will measure the student's cognitive workload and engagement, and use this information to adapt aspects of the instructional strategy such as topic selection, content difficulty and interactivity in a closed-loop fashion.  The goals of this project are to modify current brain-wave measurement systems for use by children and young adults, extend associated computational algorithms and validate them to an industry standard, and evaluate the effect of adding brain-based metrics to student models that are at the core of adaptive technologies.  To meet these objectives, we will perform research and development to advance technologies for brain-activity monitoring, and conduct studies with students in grades 6 through 12 who will be tutored in subjects such as math, biology and history while their brain activity is recorded.  The results will be used to determine the effects of using brain activity data to improve the adaptability of computer-based tutors and expand the depth of information available to educational data analytics platforms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is (1) the significant improvement in fertility rates among infertile couples and especially for patients suffering from non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), which is found in 1% of the male population and in up to 20% of male infertility cases and is associated with non-measurable levels of sperm in the ejaculate. Automated systems to collect sperm from these samples would greatly reduce costs and failure rates.  (2) Second, the proposed devices will be used in the preparation of insemination samples to isolate high quality sperm, or in the removal of white blood cells from a heterogeneous sample to yield sperm samples that are suitable for intrauterine insemination, again leading to higher fertility rates and lower costs for infertile couples.  (3) The sperm processing market could be substantial: If approximately 50% of labs in the US used this system, the total cycles per year would be approximately 44,000. At a cost of $250/each, the market for NOA alone would be $11M.  The utility in insemination and microTESE come not only in its potential effectiveness to isolate sperm but also in the decreased workload on technicians. The number of inseminations is much higher in the US and would add additional room for market expansion of at least $30M/year.  Rates of insemination are much higher in Europe and growing in Asia, suggesting the overall market could readily be more than $100M/year.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is about improving current clinical procedures for Microsurgical Testicular Sperm Extraction (mTESE) when used with patients suffering from non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), which includes a large proportion of infertile men (10% - 20%). For patients suffering with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), obtaining sperm presents a great challenge, and thus, the rate of pregnancy for this group of infertile patients remains low. mTESE procedures currently rely on manual microscopic inspection of testicular tissue specimens to identify sperm in a mTESE sample that has very low concentration of sperm cells and a large concentration of other cells and bioparticles. Hence extracting sperm from mTESE samples is a long, inefficient (low sperm recovery) and labor-intensive process. This project involves the development of a microfluidic system that improves sperm recovery rates specifically from NOA patients. The microfluidic system would utilize label-free cell separation technologies to separate sperm from other cells/bioparticles and then sort the separated sperm in groups for cryopreservation. The final outcome of the project would be a system that inputs a mTESE sample and outputs groups of sperm that can be cryopreserved at the group-level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in developing a technologically advanced textile dye particle originating with plant material that will reduce water pollution, help alleviate stress on constrained water supplies, and improve factory worker health by creating a high performance, low water use natural dye for fabrics. Wet textile processing is the largest contributor to fresh water pollution worldwide. The waste-water carries a significant amount of toxic chemicals such as salts, heavy metals including chrome, and toxic biocides, organic chemicals and anions that are energy consumptive and difficult to clean. These chemicals affect the people who work with them and ecosystems worldwide. Engineering a technologically advanced natural dye and application process in the United States will satisfy a consumer demand for healthier options for themselves and their children in apparel, bedding and other textiles; will simultaneously create manufacturing, engineering and technology jobs; and will drastically reduce water use and dye pollution. The new technology will be competitive with current dyeing solutions, even at a premium cost, because of the inherent value added. It will serve as a model and supplier to disrupt a very mature industry on a global scale eventually reaching an economy of scale for mass market over 5-10 years.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 1 project will result in a natural dye process that is a healthy alternative to chemical based dyeing of textiles. Chemical based dyes often contain known carcinogens and pollute environments and create serious and lasting healthy problems for industry workers. The developed natural dye technology will be able to compete against chemical dyes in both performance and cost. The research will examine the effects of microencapsulating natural dye molecules in order to protect the dyes from UV light and fading with washing while retaining the environmental and health benefit of plant based dyes. Another key objective is to ensure a one-step attachment of the particles by adding "green" binder materials to foam formulations. Foam application onto textiles has high absorption rates with low moisture, therefore creating less waste, more even dyeing and 80% less water usage than commonly used water baths for dyeing. The anticipated results are that the microencapsulated dye particles will permanently bond to the textiles and give the high performance value of colorfastness while reducing manufacturing costs and using natural resources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project promotes a promising new approach to improve employee wellness with the potential for wider application beyond the workplace. This improved approach combines both innovative clinical diagnostics with computer assisted learning to guide recommendations. It offers the potential to curb epidemic chronic disease through the use of efficient as well as scalable operating models. Adopting this data-driven approach is expected to improve not only participating employees? health but also reduce health care costs. Increased productivity which follows from improved employee health can also be expected. Accordingly, better health and economic savings to both corporate America and working Americans are realistic objectives of this project. Employers and the general public therefore are expected to benefit from this initiative.

    The proposed project combines novel as well as economic use of clinical diagnostics, strengthened by computer learning, to effectively improve workplace wellness. Conventional wellness strategies are presently both inefficient as well as ineffective in addressing the growing epidemic of chronic diseases. These chronic diseases include but are not limited to: diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. The principal objective of this project is the integration of various clinical findings in prevention of chronic disease enhanced by machine learning. This unique approach aids in the development of scalable, workplace wellness programs which are effective and affordable. The novel platform continuously learns from all participants? interventional results and intelligently discovers the best preventive intervention plan for each participant. The platform innovatively adopts low cost quantitative diagnostic imagery to track key health parameters clinically correlated to wellness. Computer aided modeling includes dynamic physiological models (i.e. current symptoms, lifestyle measurements, past medical history, MRI scans and laboratory tests) to clinically evaluate the course of chronic disease along with various prevention strategies for intervention. Measures of clinical outcome enhanced by machine learning identify important biomarkers to develop intervention recommendations for participating individuals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the microbial production by fermentation of a group of natural food colorants, called anthocyanins, which will benefit the environment, the food industry, and society as a whole. The fermentation production process provides a "green chemistry" approach to issues usually encountered in traditional chemical synthesis, such as hazardous catalysts, and eliminates a solvent waste problem typically associated with extraction of natural compounds from botanicals. The proposed work will lead to a greater understanding of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, and result in a lower cost of production of these compounds. Innovation and understanding of the biochemical pathways and process optimization will help serve the potentially multi-billion dollar global market for high purity natural food colorants as food ingredients, as health care products, and in therapeutic applications.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to engineer microorganisms that are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS), and are currently used for the production of several food additives as microbial cell factories for the production of various anthocyanin molecules. Preliminary work on the biosynthesis of the anthocyanins, using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli recombinant strains, has demonstrated feasibility of this bio-economic approach. Initial work will involve the introduction of plant metabolic pathways in microorganisms via various gene-splicing methods. Further process optimization will be undertaken by improving fermentation conditions and by performing an initial scale-up using the recombinant microorganisms. This microbial fermentation strategy will help enhance the production of such beneficial natural food colorants through a biomanufactuing approach utilizing principles of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering and other emerging biotechnologies.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will investigate
    a hybrid, lightweight aluminum self-lubricating composite system which has promise
    to reduce friction and improve performance of cylinder liners in internal combustion
    engines. Friction between moving parts in an internal combustion engine, especially
    between the piston rings and cylinder liner, accounts for a large percentage of
    the parasitic losses that harm fuel economy. The high-performance materials to
    be studied and optimized in this work can lead to reduced oil and fuel consumption
    and greenhouse gas emissions in a range of internal combustion (IC) engines. The
    Total Available Market (TAM) for cylinder liners in all internal combustion engines
    worldwide is estimated to be in excess of several billion dollars per year. Every
    internal combustion engine has one or more cylinders. The served available market
    (SAM) for powersports engines alone is estimated to be greater than $35 million.
    The initial target market for these materials will be cylinder liners for small
    displacement powersports engines, with the potential for follow-on markets in
    a wide array of personal and commercial vehicle engines. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project derives in part from the development of a database of structure-processing-property
    relationships in hybrid aluminum-silicon carbide-graphite metal matrix composites
    for internal combustion engine cylinder applications.  This will include development
    of processing methods to manufacture cylinder liners with uniform dispersions
    of SiC and graphite, and will involve both lab and field testing of cylinder liner
    materials.  The project work will help quantify and analyze the changes in friction
    coefficient, wear rate, fuel consumption, and oil by-pass for different hybrid
    composite liners in personal watercraft engines, and thereby help quantify the
    benefits to the end user in terms of energy savings, reduced emissions and improved
    performance. This project is designed to understand the best formulation of composite
    constituents to optimize performance while minimizing cost. There has not been
    a fundamental study to optimize compositions based on balancing costs, performance
    and emission characteristics. This work will help to develop a set of design principles
    for optimized liner chemistries depending on desired performance."

The goal is to increase the interest in science for children in grades 5-8, where there is a shortage of science teachers, and where educational tools must compete with the high level of technology to which young people are attracted, like games with talking avatars and virtual personal assistants to answer their questions. Increasing students' interest in science careers can help fill the projected worker shortage for high tech industries and provide desperately needed science teachers. Filling these jobs is expected to increase America's GDP (and tax revenues) and high tech exports. This project will develop the initial offering in a projected series to facilitate independent learning of science, mathematics, engineering, history, the arts and other subjects through interesting stories and exciting virtual environments populated with XAs for the leaders in their fields.

    The project will build on the successful application in education of computer-based virtual environments and games by adding two important features. First, the digital content will be complemented by the book, whose characters use a fictional virtual environment to solve the same STARDUST MYSTERY posed in the game. What is STARDUST? Where, when and how did it form? How did it get into George Washington and from him to you? The book provides an introduction, user's guide, scaffolding and sales channel for the game. Second, the virtual environment and game, developed with Unity 3-D, will be populated by XAs for some of the great minds in science. The game will support virtual explorations, such as a trip back through time to the Big Bang and virtual visits with the XAs. The XA's will be backed by an artificial intelligence (AI) system to support a conversation where students' can get answers to questions about the XA's contributions, their lives and their period in history. Responses will be generated using customized knowledge bases for each XA and a hybrid, cloud-based AI system.  The project will include a formative evaluation of the game combined with book excerpts to assess the benefits of, and receptivity to, the game, book and XA combination.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project has several
    facets. From the standpoint of scientific understanding, using a reverberation
    chamber with time-varying and non-homogeneous reflection from the walls is a new
    concept, and successful understanding of this technology may impact a variety
    of applications. More specifically for wireless device testing, the fact that
    the most accurate traditional testing methods for wireless device performance
    are costly, they are unavailable to all but the largest companies or research
    organizations. The development of an accurate, low-cost, and rapid testing capability
    levels the playing field among wireless device development organizations and introduces
    consumer-benefitting competition into the market. Furthermore, the low cost fosters
    the development of emerging technologies that may offer low initial revenue but
    provide high social value. Finally, because the low-cost and accurate testing
    capability will enable wireless device designers to improve performance and offer
    increased spectral efficiency, it will foster increased access to the limited
    radio spectrum, enabling more people to have the access to information that they
    need for personal and economic development. \n\nThis Small Business Technology
    Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is motivated by the observation that
    emerging wireless devices must offer increased levels of sophistication in order
    to keep pace with the growing demand for data throughput. Achieving this objective
    requires development of new testing methods that can rapidly and accurately assess
    the effectiveness of emerging devices at a low-cost. The innovative reconfigurable
    over-the-air chamber (ROTAC) proposed in this work promises dramatic improvement
    in wireless device testing. The proposed activities focus on three key technical
    challenges: 1) generation of a detailed simulation model that allows detailed
    understanding of the behavior of a ROTAC for wireless device testing; 2) exploration
    of optimization algorithms that can quickly determine the reconfigurable parameters
    that achieve the desired channel characteristics; and 3) implementation of algorithms
    on an experimental ROTAC prototype. Successful completion of these activities
    will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology as a commercial product and
    enable observation of the technology limitations and strengths."

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project enables the development of laser-induced refractive index change (LIRIC) for non-invasive vision correction in cornea and hydrogel materials.  In the United States, 150 million adults use some form of vision correction, and this number is projected to increase steadily with the aging population. LIRIC has the potential to transform how laser refractive surgery is performed and how hydrogel-based solutions (e.g., contact lenses, intraocular lenses) are produced.  For use in the cornea, LIRIC is a process that can alter the optical quality of the cornea without cutting, ablating or removing tissue. Also, only a thin layer of the cornea is treated, which allows a patient to continuously adjust their optics as their prescription changes over their lifetime. This is vastly different from current laser refractive surgery techniques, which are highly invasive and do not allow for future adjustment. In hydrogel materials, traditional manufacturing techniques use diamond-turned molds to achieve desired lens shape. LIRIC can change the production paradigm by enabling just-in-time manufacturing, reducing inventory costs. Additionally, because arbitrary refractive corrections are achievable with LIRIC, patients will be able to receive prescriptions with customized corrections.  This capability is unavailable using today's typical manufacturing methods.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in operating an ultrafast femtosecond laser below the damage threshold to modify the refractive index of corneal or hydrogel material. By dynamically changing laser parameters (power and/or scan velocity), it is possible to create arbitrary refractive-index profiles in cornea or hydrogel, enabling the optical correction of myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia and higher order aberrations. Research objectives for this proposal are centered around the optimization of the LIRIC process. By investigating the impact of laser parameters and optical design of the laser delivery system, it will be possible to enhance the efficacy and safety of in-vivo LIRIC. In addition, visual performance will also be assessed in eyes wearing LIRIC contact lenses. By correcting the eye's wavefront aberrations, LIRIC optical devices are expected to significantly improve visual quality in patients beyond the capacity of currently available techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in Organic Rankine Cycles for distributed solar power generation at micro scale and will offer a cheaper alternative to solar photovoltaic (PV), with a payback period of just 4.5 year without government incentives. The use of solar thermal to generate power at residential level would offer a renewed encouragement to the solar thermal industry. With the ability to provide heat and hot water plus electricity, the solar thermal powered product would fulfill the energy requirements of a home single handedly. Most are familiar with the traditional perspective on the societal impact of a system like the Compact ORC - lower energy demand and reduced greenhouse gas. In addition the CORC positively impacts health and wellbeing by improving indoor air quality and providing affordable access. A number of clinical studies connect improved indoor air quality from efficient systems with a reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Combining the health benefits of clean indoor air and improved living conditions, the downstream impact on healthcare cost would be enormous.

    This project attempts to solve the problem of high cost for renewable energy from solar energy, both PV and solar thermal, at the residential and light commercial level without government incentives. Solar thermal can provide heat and hot water but not electricity.  PV can provide electricity but not heat and hot water. The Compact ORC concept can do both with Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Current ORC systems are bulky and inefficient and most importantly high cost.  The objective of this research is to combine all of the components of the ORC in one compact, integrated, low cost package. The expander, pump, and generator will all be mounting on a common shaft. The evaporator and condenser heat exchangers will be mounted integral with the ORC reducing inefficiencies and packaging cost. There will be no external piping of components together. The result will be a compact unit that is cost and performance competitive with grid energy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the assistive use by blind people of thermal imaging. The resulting product provides a person who is blind or visually impaired with the relevant information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space in order to assist blind users in everyday activities. Thermal imaging can differentiate people and objects from their background without the need for complex image analysis. The shape and the temperature of the human body allows the location of people to be easily determined. The societal impact will be assisting users in navigation of complex public spaces. A blind person can use a smartphone?s haptic touchscreen display to examine the thermal image to determine the location of people in front of them. Information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space can be learned from the heat and shape of materials. Examples would be locating vending machines like ATMs and train passes. The market sector for this technology will likely extend beyond assisting blind users, to include additional commercial opportunities as well.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will leverage past National Science Foundation Funded research to develop a product that a blind/low vision user can use to receive practical navigation and interaction information about their environment from a multimodal thermogram (thermal image) interface on a smartphone. There are no practical assistive technologies for blind or low vision users that allow them to locate people, objects, and the layout information of their surroundings other than exploring with a cane. This development will address the objective of creating an interface that provides both practical utility and will be accepted by the target demographic of blind users. This project represents an excellent translational path from NSF-sponsored research programs to a product that is built from the ground up on solid theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings from multimodal human information processing. This development will use thermal radiation from people, machines, lighting and heat retention differences in building materials and convert this data into a user interface to facilitate blind navigation and environment interaction. The product resulting will be a multimodal (kinesthetic, vibro-tactile, and auditory) interface for blind users of a smartphone to interpret and gain useful value from thermal image information.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance global food security. Aquaculture
    is the fastest growing agroindustry while the world fisheries catch has leveled
    out. Consequently, half of all seafood consumed today is farmed. Unfortunately,
    at least 30% of fish feed is derived from forage fish, the anchovy and sardine-types
    at the base of the food chain. With demand for forage fish growing while wild
    populations remain level at best, the price of fish meal and oil (FM&0) climbs
    by 15% yearly. Clearly, dependence on FM&O is unsustainable. For fish farmers
    to thrive without abusing the oceanic ecosystem, substitutes are essential. One
    solution is to use vegetable-based ingredients such as wheat and soy, but these
    lack vital omega-3 fatty acids. Another is to turn to the insect world, especially
    by culturing ecofriendly black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). The larvae are fed seafood
    residuals mixed with marine kelp and/or microalgae so that the natural omega-3
    passes through. The larvae are dried and separated into FM&O-like meal and oil.
    The overarching question is: can this be accomplished competitively? Apparently
    it is possible, but a 2-year pilot plant is required to prove the practicality.
    \ \n\nThe proposed project will not only demonstrate that very large volumes of
    BSFL can be cultured using omega-3 loaded wastes and algae, but that substitute
    fish feeds that are palatable, stimulate growth and confer health are feasible.
    This is best achieved by simultaneously conducting feeding trials with a variety
    of species, including isolated bottom dwellers such as black sea bass and, alternatively,
    schooling pelagic creatures such as California yellowtail. Observing degrees of
    palatability is straight forward. But as with any cuisine there are numerous ways
    to enhance the offering: live, dried or pelletized and, if the latter, unit size,
    moisture content and even some surface additive that confers a natural taste ?
    perhaps crab-like for black sea bass and squid-like for California yellowtail.
    Such refinements grant significant economic margins by virtue of better survival
    rates, shorter time in the tanks and less costly ingredients. At this local level,
    both the farmer and the consumer benefit while globally these gains can favorably
    impact food security, especially with marine species that only require saltwater,
    with recirculating system that discharge little or no waste and, of course, with
    substitute foodstuff derived from waste bio-remediated by flies."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a new standard of quantifying touch for industries currently relying on qualitative data from expert sensory panels (the tactile equivalent of professional wine tasters). Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently. The research proposed herein will test hypotheses that a biologically inspired robotic system can measure properties that correspond to subjective percepts, descriptors and associations that humans use to characterize objects by touch.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and commercialization of a new technology for non-invasive preclinical imaging.  This platform technology will be used in studies of disease or in in drug development.  The project will further develop and validate an imaging platform based on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, which is a low cost, high-throughput alternative to existing whole-body imaging modalities, and will provide more sensitivity and field of view than current two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound approaches.   The technology developed will reduce costs of whole-body preclinical imaging, and enable access to this technology to smaller research organizations.  Increased availability of a low-cost imaging tool for preclinical disease and drug development studies could accelerate progress in improving human health while reducing cost burdens on life science labs.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that 2D ultrasound is a preferred imaging modality in preclinical studies due to the adequate resolution, high throughput, and low cost; however, it suffers from user variability and inadequate field of view.  The research objectives will be to continue the development and validation of a 3D ultrasound system which overcomes challenges of user variability and inadequate field of view.  Specific technical goals will be to improve both the hardware and software of the system for increased throughput, integrating the system components into a cohesive customer-facing product, and calibrating and validating the system for its intended preclinical imaging application. Expected results will be a novel technology ? an automated 3D preclinical ultrasound system, which will substantially improve the performance and capabilities of preclinical ultrasound imaging, yet will retain the low-cost and high throughput characteristics of ultrasound imaging.  This new technology will fill a need present in nearly every academic research institution as well as pharmaceutical and contract research organizations worldwide.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a safe and effective cure for fungal
    nail infections. In addition, the technology developed in this project could be
    utilized in other healthcare treatments such as skin and wound disinfection, decontamination
    of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the sterilization of medical instruments
    and implanted devices.  Fungal nail infection rates are growing at an estimated
    7% annually following both the general aging of the population and the rise in
    the incidence of diabetes. 50% of elderly over the age of 70 and 30% of all diabetics
    are affected. For many people, their infected nails are painful and embarrassing.
    Worst of all, diabetics with fungal nail infections are at increased risk for
    foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputation. 38 million Americans suffer from nail
    fungal infections and spend over $3 billion dollars each year on treatments that
    are ineffective and sometimes unsafe. People suffering with nail fungal infections
    express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high
    cost and inconvenience of current treatments.  \n\nThe proposed project will complete
    prototype development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment option for onychomycosis
    (nail fungal infection).  The medical device will allow a doctor to fumigate the
    infected nail with gas because gas can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus
    where all other treatments cannot reach. The human toe nail lacks a blood supply
    to deliver optimal immune system protection to fight off fungal infections. This
    project will develop a device that converts the air above the surface of the toe
    nail into the same gases used by the immune system to fight infection. Hence,
    the gas treatment would safely mimic the normal blood supply of anti-microbial
    chemicals. This SBIR project will reduce technical development risks, improve
    the device usability by doctors, and establish the manufacturability of the device.
    Device prototypes will be validated in the laboratory and with users (Podiatrists).
    The clinical-ready prototypes developed during this project will be used in future
    clinical trials that will prove the efficacy and safety of the device needed to
    sell the product. The device promises to fulfill the unmet medical need for a
    safe and effective treatment option for the millions of Americans suffering with
    fungal infected nails."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods.


    This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project develops eWriter devices for classroom use as a sustainable paper replacement technology and an effective tool for student-teacher interaction.  The eWriters provide a paper-like writing experience and electronically capture, store, and transfer handwritten text and images.  For education, eWriters introduce a sustainable paper replacement technology at a lower cost than other classroom technologies.  The eWriters enable handwritten student work to be wirelessly uploaded to teachers and to virtual whiteboards.  Positive societal impacts come from improved teaching methods and student-teacher interactions, particularly for high quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy, where handwritten notes are advantageous.  The most immediate societal benefit of educational eWriters is significant reduction in paper usage, carbon footprints, and costs for schools.  Expanding domestic high tech roll-to-roll production of eWriters benefits the flexible electronics supply chain and materials development. The eWriter display technology, developed and manufactured in Ohio, is exported around the world.  This project helps sustain both the U.S. economy and the environment.  Existing eWriter product, distribution, retail channels, and marketing give a strong platform for commercialization.  This project impacts numerous and far reaching areas in education, environmental improvement, domestic manufacturing, materials improvements, and process development.

    This project enables digital writing for K-12 and post-secondary classrooms along with a seamless information and communication system so teachers and students can effectively exchange handwritten work digitally and reduce paper use.  The research objectives include the development of eWriter technologies (ruggedness, performance, design), the development of software ecosystems for classrooms (use models, user interface systems), and the development of usage strategies for new teaching techniques.  Multidisciplinary methods will be used involving researchers in education, liquid crystal display technology, engineering, and software development to successfully achieve project objectives.  Experts in the application of technology in education will develop and evaluate eWriter usage strategies for improved instruction and student performance depending on grade level and teaching style.  This new type of education technology has tremendous and far reaching impacts in areas of pedagogical techniques, flexible electronics, liquid crystal and polymeric materials, and environmental sustainability.  The anticipated results are a suite of eWriter devices and systems to be deployed in K-12 and post-secondary education.  The lead organization will commercialize these new products into educational markets leveraging existing sales and marketing infrastructure.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project studies the problem of how to engage students
    in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) education through game-based
    learning in a Virtual Robotics computer game. In the game, students design, assemble
    and train virtual walking robots to compete against their peer robots to secure
    a seat on a virtual mission to Mars. The project analyses the effects of competition
    and collaboration on the learning and retention of key robotic control concepts.
    The project will produce a low-cost educational computer game, where far more
    U.S. middle schools and high schools students can learn about biomechanics, math,
    physics and computer algorithms through a robotic simulation game than is possible
    with current robot hardware approaches. The product provides the American educational
    system a solution to quickly engage students in STEM who might otherwise turn
    away. STEM field professions can lead to high paying jobs, which in turn can improve
    productivity and the economic landscape for America. \n\nThe project's education
    technology innovation is a cloud-based robot evolution game engine where students
    acting as a crowd can evolve the behavior of walking bi-pedal robots. The evolution
    of robot behavior happens on three levels: 1) the micro scale where an individual
    or small group of students evolves singular robot behaviors, 2) the mid-scale
    where groups exchange individual behaviors to form a behavior sequence to meet
    game level challenges. (For example, link a sequence of behaviors to stand, walk,
    jump, and turn to clear a section of obstacles and reach the prize goal), 3) the
    macro scale where the community evolves a cumulative set of behaviors through
    re-use and adoption of most efficient behaviors, discarding failed behaviors and
    creating new game level challenges. In particular, this project studies how individual
    and group learning is affected by adjusting the reward incentive, competitive
    motivation, novelty and surprise, and challenge level difficulty. During competition,
    the game gathers data regarding level of student learning and robot performance
    to answer two specific questions: a) do students learn more through small group
    or large group collaboration/competition, and b) are the students more engaged
    in small or large scale crowd-sourced environments."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a novel platform technology: a high-torque electrostatic motor (EM). This readily scalable platform machine technology can provide any desired torque or power rating necessary along with increased energy accessibility and reduced energy/operating costs compared to traditional steel-copper-magnet based motors. Instead of using permanent magnets or wire coil mechanisms, this motor exploits electrostatic forces between closely spaced, conductive metal plates to create an electric field, with shaft-torque capabilities far beyond those of conventional machines. By allowing industry more efficient operations, resources will be freed for continued innovation, spurring economic growth. This EM uses domestically-sourced materials like aluminum, steel, and plastic instead of rare earth elements like neodymium, dysprosium, or samarium used in traditional motors, thus reducing both dependence on foreign supply chains of rare earths and market volatility. EMs will be lighter-weight and less expensive to produce than traditional motors. Value is offered to numerous commercial markets, including electric/hybrid-electric cars, industrial automation, renewable energy (wind turbines), and machines operating in extreme environments (aerospace or down-hole drilling) through lower materials costs, increased reliability, higher efficiencies at low speed, and reduced weight.

    The Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) Phase 2 project will expand understanding of electrostatic machinery, including operational principles, design principles, and strengths/weaknesses of this novel platform technology. This represents the first significant breakthrough in motor/machine technology in almost 150 years. Previously, electrostatic technology had few applications due to a limited body of knowledge, despite occasional study throughout the last century. This was primarily due to technological limitations (low capacitance, the necessity of vacuum used as an insulating medium), whose solution required knowledge spanning multiple technical fields (electric field theory, chemistry, mechanical engineering, material science, and power electronic controls). By addressing these technological limitations in P-I, this project already expanded the body of pertinent engineering and physics knowledge. This P-II project offers opportunities for additional study ranging far beyond those currently envisioned. For example, optimizing electrostatic/mechatronic systems such as sophisticated electrostatic drive systems will likely involve the use of highly-engineered materials (metamaterials and composites); next-generation 3D multiphysics simulation platforms to simultaneously solve fluid dynamic, electrostatic, and thermal behaviors; and development of chemical synthesis processes to maximize electrostatic force production. Advanced manufacturing technologies will likely emerge, leading to possibilities including injection molding or 3D printing of a machine.

    This SBIR Phase II project represents a revolutionary advance in adaptive educational technology systems by using data collected from previous exercises to automatically generate hints and feedback for students. This work addresses the SBIR Educational Technologies and Applications subtopic EA5 - Learning and Assessment by making adaptive learning widely available and by providing tools to assess student performance in order to make interventions as early as possible and help students succeed. While it is well known that adaptive Computer Based Training (CBT) is more efficient and more effective, it has traditionally been cost prohibitive to produce in most domains. By leveraging the latest research in Big Data analytics and Educational Data Mining (EDM), this project will produce adaptive capabilities automatically, dramatically reducing the costs of producing more effective training and making such training widely available. The core customers for this technology will be providers of training systems. This includes publishing organizations, developers of software tools for education, and providers of corporate and government training. Institutions that are struggling to educate students, particularly across STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, will be able to use this technology in their existing teaching systems and thus improve student engagement and performance.

    The final outcome of this project will be an integrated set of software tools that collect data from existing computer/web based training software, and automatically generate adaptive capabilities to create a personalized learning environment for students. It does this by using novel EDM and machine learning techniques to build and organize student and problem models that improve over time as more data is collected. It also provides for the tracking of student progress on specific concepts or skills (knowledge tracing), allowing for easy assessment at any point in time. The system also dynamically selects the students' next problems to maximize student learning and minimize time needed to master a set of skills (problem selection). For complex multi-step problems, this system will provide context-specific, just-in-time hints to help students as they learn. The final product will include data adapters that allow developers of existing software to seamlessly connect with this system. Finally, a main differentiator of this system is the transparent process of data curation and the related visualization tools that expose the problem- and student-model generation process. This combination of human input and machine learning will provide researchers, developers, and educators tools to explore student data and allow for new insights into how students learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is an online, game-based program to improve the leadership skills of individuals in science, education, the military, government, and industry. Leadership skills are key to innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness in all organizations. The program being developed is built on a proven leadership model and converts that traditional model into a role-playing game. The empirically tested model consists of three basic strategies and six practices that expand leaders' perspectives and enhance their problem-solving skills. The program uses a futuristic narrative, 3D-animated multimedia, and challenging leadership dilemmas to engage learners, who play the role of a novice world leader. The program provides instruction in leadership, and then learners apply their new leadership skills to build an alliance among warring factions and collectively solve a global problem. A series of game quests test learners' understanding, and they receive immediate feedback on all decisions and actions. Learners communicate through social media tools with other players and, at the end, participate in a virtual synchronous debriefing exercise with peers and trained facilitators to ensure full comprehension. An administrative dashboard provides real-time performance data. The game is scalable, accessible, and designed for repeat playability.

    The most profound innovation of this project is that it conceptualizes, designs, and develops a system of game mechanics and algorithms that mimic the facilitator-led human aspect of a research-based, face-to-face model of leadership training. This design entails building out a backend system as an artificial intelligence tool designed to guide users engaging with instructional materials, anticipate player actions, make recommendations on actions and anticipated actions, and provide feedback similar to guidance an on-site facilitator would provide. Furthermore, the game logic supports multiple paths to success, with some paths being more efficient, optimal, elegant, or otherwise more appropriate choices. The game logic and technical design are built to reflect problem solving and leadership in the real world, which is largely based on open-ended decision making. The game mechanics and related backend technology are designed to support open-ended decision-making, thus making game play both more engaging and authentic for players. A final innovation is the linking of an asynchronous online video game learning experience with virtual facilitator-led synchronous debriefing, which can be done on a worldwide scale.  The program will be tested as a global collaboration exercise with both high school students and corporate leaders.

    and maintain their quality of life.  As back injuries cost the US alone 20 billion
    dollars annually in direct and indirect costs, the technology proposed will not
    only benefit workers but also employers. Addressing a pain point that costs billions
    of dollars globally each year gives this project strong commercial potential.
    The evaluations performed during this project will reveal the technology?s effect
    on workers? back. This will create an opportunity for other institutions to investigate
    fundamentals of human back pain or back injuries. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will improve the lives of workers and reduce financial
    burden on companies by developing a Trunk Support Exoskeleton (TSE) to reduce
    back injuries in workers caused by stooping and bending. Back injuries account
    for a large number of work place injuries. The goal of this project is to develop
    technologies based on user and customer recommendations, issues encountered during
    field evaluation, and experimentally evaluate the technology. The tasks include
    analysis, design and evaluation to reduce separation between the exoskeleton and
    the user, experiments and design to ease workers during prolonged low angle stooping
    and determining the requirements for walking while bending. It is expected that
    these features will make the technology more attractive and useable to users and
    customers. In addition, to evaluating the technology to validate the features
    above, experiments to quantify the performance of the technology during activities
    similar to those that workers would encounter will be performed. It is expected
    that the technology will reduce the participants? strain on their lower back without
    reducing their performance."

    allow for more energy efficient surface treatment, more consistency in surface
    treatment processes, reduced scrap rates in manufacturing and more reliable bonded
    and coated structures.  This in turn will reduce barriers to adoption of these
    inherently efficient manufacturing methods.  Markets that have expressed keen
    interest in the proposed sensor technology include automotive OEM?s and their
    suppliers, major airframers and their suppliers, and manufacturers of general
    purpose surface treatment equipment.  Other major markets include manufacturers
    of medical devices, consumer and industrial electronics, and food packaging.  The
    theoretical and practical knowledge gained through this work will advance the
    ability to apply these principles to create robust surface free energy sensors.
    This understanding is critical for controlling many processes that depend on wetting
    phenomena, including printing, adhesive bonding, painting, rapid prototyping and
    additive manufacturing, application of agricultural chemicals, and aircraft deicing.
    \ \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address
    the needs engendered by the current environmentally mandated shift from solvent-based
    adhesives and coatings to water-borne systems, which has made the control of surface
    treatment extremely critical. Currently, surface treatment processes are performed
    without feedback control.  The quality of surface treatment is determined by expensive
    destructive testing.  The proposed sensor is based on ultra rapid determination
    of the equilibrium shape of a miniscule drop of a probe liquid on the surface
    in question, a parameter directly related to the Gibbs free energy of the surface.
    The research objectives are to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship
    between ballistic deposition parameters of small liquid drops, the morphology
    and energetics of a substrate surface, and the equilibrium drop geometry, and
    utilize this knowledge to design and construct prototype closed loop control surface
    processing equipment. This understanding will be developed primarily through high-speed
    imaging of the interaction of growing droplets with surfaces of various chemical
    composition and morphology.  This knowledge will be incorporated into the design
    and construction of prototype surface processing equipment that includes closed
    loop feedback for precise control and verification of surface free energy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is a new product for improving the performance of existing machinery. If this project is successful, numerous industrial and commercial applications will benefit from increased component longevity and more efficient operation of machinery, coupled with labor and energy savings. From a societal perspective, this technology has the potential to save a large portion of the substantial amount of energy lost to friction in ubiquitous components such as generators and engines, while simultaneously reducing wear-related material/component failures and associated downtime costs. Previous research has predicted that a successful global application of the proposed technology in existing transportation systems will enable an absolute energy savings that exceeds the total energy generated by all currently-deployed photovoltaic, geothermal, and biomass sources combined.

    This project will focus on the further development and scale-up of ceramic nanosheets with structurally different sides (sticky/slick), which will be used to form a self-generating tribological thin film coating for improved lubrication.  This coating is formed during normal operation, particle by particle. The creation of these low-friction tribological coatings has been previously observed but requires further optimization for robustness and additional engineering and testing for commercial applications. Understanding the influence of composition and surface dopants is required for market application of the resulting, nearly frictionless coatings.  Additional material testing and successful scale-up of the production of these nanosheets are needed for commercial viability.  Follow-on applications of these anisotropic nanostructures are envisioned in the areas of catalyst supports, plastic fillers, and smart materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve the care of cancer patients by providing an integrated platform for clinical data and image analytics to their care providers for better clinical decision making. Tight integration of clinical data with radiology images will enable evidence-based approaches to be used by care providers in oncology. The tools being developed in this project will enable accelerated transition of comprehensive data-driven cancer research into clinical practice for decision making related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent trends, such as wide adoption of electronic medical records and radiological images and availability of powerful computing at reasonable prices have made it possible to improve the prognostic and diagnostic power of data, in particular imaging data analysis in healthcare.  The integrated analytics platform being developed will streamline treatment monitoring by imaging and reduce diagnostic errors; hence increasing the quality to cancer care.

    The proposed project aims to develop an integrated, minable, clinical and imaging data analytics platform for oncology. The platform combines recent advances in data mining, context search, image segmentation and deformable registration into an imaging system deployed at the point of care. The diagnostic potential of clinical and image data will be enhanced by the ability to compare lesion characteristics of the current case to a large repository of lesions from other studies with known diagnosis. The proposed search tool will generate patient cohorts with a given set of diagnosis and treatment conditions and present the related images to the diagnostician. Additional technology will locate and track tumors and provide detailed characterization such as size, shape, location and texture with detailed analytics. A large, minable database of segmented tumors and detailed metrics will advance research into identifying ?imaging biomarkers?. The embedded imaging platform will allow clinicians to access these decision support tools across a wide spectrum of devices from powerful personal computers to tablets and other mobile devices.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on robot systems designed for early childhood education (preK-2). There is increasing research and applications for educational robotics, but little attention are focused on the foundational years. The early childhood segment is underserved because there are few available platforms for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education that are developmentally appropriate for children 4-7 years old. However, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood result in lower costs and more durable effects than those that begin later on. This project focuses on developmentally appropriate robot kits for young children, and the curriculum support, teacher resources and automated assessment tools to make this innovation useful for early childhood education in a broadly disseminated, sustainable and scalable way. Recent re-envisioning of early childhood programs by the Federal government has resulted in calls to develop innovative technologies and approaches for teaching STEM. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant, opening new markets and job opportunities.  This innovation also has the potential to have significant positive impact on the US economy by preparing children with economically important skills.


    The innovation underlying this project is the design of a robot system that engages 4 to 7 year old children in learning programming concepts through the use of a developmentally appropriate programming language. In order to be developmentally appropriate for this age range, the programming language is physical, not typed, with no screens or keyboards of any kind required. The resulting educational platform also enables children to develop engineering design process skills by building physical objects that can respond to different inputs through the use of sensors. This project is organized around five technical objectives: a developmentally appropriate robot kit for young children to learn programming and engineering; robot modules for curriculum integration with other areas such as math, science, literacy and the arts; support systems for early childhood teachers through a web portal with resources for both formal and informal education and professional development strategies; and an automated learning assessment system that collects data characterizing student learning directly from the robot, analyzes it through innovative mechanisms and displays it using visualization tools according to the different needs of parents, educators and school leadership to understand learning outcomes; and cost reduction of the robot system for broadening adoption.

    to answer the presidential call to \"create digital tutors that are as effective
    as personal tutors.\" More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative,
    and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible
    and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA)
    practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing
    teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous
    potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent
    on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project
    will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized
    instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and
    suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model
    student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new
    forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create
    significant commercial value within the educational market. \n\nThis project will
    create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems
    to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive
    problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as
    if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability
    of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time
    assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the
    fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and
    big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning
    process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial,
    the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The
    researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative
    review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of
    teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work,
    and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus
    software in the FA loop)."

    farming seafood. To date only a limited amount of marine aquaculture on-land and
    indoors is carried out anywhere utilizing  a technology  requiring only saltwater,
    limited space and our novel zero waste approach,. This approach takes advantage
    of ecological principle whereby diverse aquatic species ? including fish, sandworms,
    algae, oysters, seaweed and more ? are cultured together in a cyclic system in
    a way that allows the waste from one to serve as nutrition for others. Because
    such facilities are not in the ocean, seafood culture will no longer be restricted
    by certain naturally ideal habitats, competition for space, strict environmental
    regulations, occasional pollution and hazardous weather. Indeed, they offer what
    may be the only technology able to satisfy the ever growing global demand for
    protein. The inputs required are sunlight for the plants and feed, but even the
    latter can be cultured either internally or derived from ever-present, external
    waste streams. The approach is commercially attractive, too, especially when combined
    with alternative energy sources. Being modular, the first unit can be readily
    emulated everywhere. \n\t\nThe proposed project seeks to break away from dependency
    on the oceans for seafood production sites and, of course, to do so in a manner
    that is economically viable. On-land production does offer challenges, many of
    which are overcome by farming diverse kinds of seafood together, a second break-away
    that confers health and generates byproduct revenues. To do so requires new farm
    designs, a grasp of each aquatic crop?s special needs and full understanding of
    how each interacts beneficially with others within the shared space and seawater.
    To achieve this so that the first full scale, commercial operation can be undertaken
    with confidence, it is deemed vital that a pilot plant be operated for not less
    than two years. Within that period, approximately ten forms of marketable marine
    plants and animals will be introduced. Health, growth and overall water quality
    will be carefully monitored. Special attention will be given to purely practical
    aspects of aquafarm management so that, when commercial, any reasonably capable

    design, will be a major deliverable of the research in addition to the proposed
    demonstration. From apparent complexity, simple commercial methods will emerge."

    in the Common Core Standards, teachers are expected to target students? ability
    to conduct short as well as more sustained research projects. The Internet is
    not only the obvious go-to place for teaching these skills but one of the reasons

    for learners of all ages to engage in inquiry, it enables differentiated learning
    and gives learners a life-long tool to help them understand and critically engage

    that match the student's reading level and are appropriate for her current familiarity

    and collaborative filtering methods. The resulting research tool, a personalized
    web curator, is based on novel methods for modeling the student's familiarity
    with the topic of web resources. These methods are extended to include novel analysis
    of video content. Unlike other adaptive educational products, the system's adaptive
    recommendations do not rely on obtaining test scores from the user and corresponding
    them to  pre-labeled, leveled data. The complete solution includes an integrated
    gamified experience that helps the students acquire basic and advanced research
    skills and develop the habit of applying them consistently. The project team includes
    educational technology experts from academia and schools and conducts extensive
    studies evaluating learning benefits by the afforded differentiation in instruction,

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a system to dramatically simplify how course content is shared, discovered, curated and managed in educational institutions. The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

    The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace
    of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies
    into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at
    such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge
    searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most
    fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different
    knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We
    need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are
    disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive
    similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information
    relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting
    unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would
    be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a
    strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,
    unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by
    providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different
    disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed
    to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on
    optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing
    technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content
    into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and
    composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between
    such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their
    self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a
    significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of
    this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions
    of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed
    so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient
    manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to
    enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of
    machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden
    structural architectural features within the document relationship network.
    Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks
    through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed
    ?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will
    be processed in the system.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research
    (SBIR) project is to develop and prototype a novel magnetic sensor capable of
    continuous detection of the small magnetic signals generated by the human heart.
    The proposed technology enables heart-rate and heart waveform detection without
    any contact to the skin, contrary to standard electrocardiograph (ECG) based devices
    that require uncomfortable electrodes, adhesives and chest straps to operate.
    Furthermore, this technology can be manufactured at low cost and easily miniaturized.
    The goal of the project is to provide a contactless, unobtrusive and comfortable
    way to evaluate the heart condition, to be used by sports enthusiasts for fitness
    heart monitoring, and for heart disease patients that require an accurate, continuous
    and long-term heart monitoring solution. The proposed technology is designed to
    be easy integrated with bracelets, smart-watches, or simply placed in a pocket,
    while constantly measuring the heart function. Its small size and low cost enables
    the broad use of this technology and easy integration with available wearables.
    Moreover, knowing that heart disease is the main cause of death in developed nations,
    we believe our low cost and easy to use device will have positive impact on public
    health, and on preventive medicine. Better preventive care will consequently help
    to lower healthcare costs. \n\nThe proposed project will focus on the development
    of a novel magnetic sensor for continuous and portable monitoring of the human
    heart, based on magnetocardiography (MCG). Portable cardiography has been limited
    to electrocardiography (ECG) sensors for decades. ECG is not suitable for continuous
    heart-rate monitoring (e.g. for in-home use by elderly patients) since it requires
    conductive (adhesive) electrodes on the patient?s chest. In contrast, MCG can
    accurately record the human heartbeat non-invasively and contactless. We propose
    a novel, chip-scale, highly sensitive magnetometer that can enter and expand the
    portable ECG heart-monitoring market. The goal of this Phase II project is to
    continue the optimization of the magnetic sensing technology, and start the development
    of prototypes and demonstration units that can record the heart signals in real
    time, providing a new and contactless way to measure heart-rate and heart waveform
    for medical diagnosis."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that more patients will benefit from minimally
    invasive surgery, in which operations are completed through tiny incisions.  In
    addition to patient benefits of less postsurgical pain, less scarring, and quicker
    recovery, minimally invasive surgery also reduces healthcare cost due to shorter
    hospital stays and lower risk of post-operative complications. Minimally invasive
    surgery impacts all surgical specialties, including gynecology, general, bariatric,
    urologic, and cardiothoracic. Although more than 1.5 million such procedures are
    performed in the US each year, wider adoption is limited by the high cost of current
    surgical robots, training burden of traditional hand-held instruments, and complexity
    of certain minimally invasive procedures. The technology developed via this project
    will enable surgeons to perform complex minimally invasive procedures such as
    hysterectomy with minimal training and at a fraction of the cost of surgical robots.
    Surgeons will benefit from this ergonomic design that will significantly reduce
    the incidence of workplace related injury associated with many laparoscopic instruments.
    This development effort will lead to a versatile platform technology that can
    impact nearly all kinds of surgeries enabling a wider adoption of minimally invasive
    surgery. \n\nThe proposed project aims to complete the design, development, verification,
    validation, regulatory clearance and commercial launch of a laparoscopic articulating
    needle driver. This novel low-cost minimally invasive surgery technology provides
    enhanced dexterity and intuitive control that is seen only in multi-million dollar
    surgical robots. Minimally invasive surgery is performed through small holes on
    a patient?s body to minimize trauma, blood loss, and recovery time, and generally
    involves suturing, knot-tying, and fine dissection, all of which would benefit
    from enhanced dexterity in the surgical instrument. Currently available low-cost
    mechanical (non-robotic) instruments either lack dexterity or are counter-intuitive
    to operate, resulting in surgeon fatigue and significant training requirements.
    Robotic instruments provide exceptional dexterity and intuitive control, but are
    costly and beyond the reach of many hospitals and patients. The proposal minimally
    invasive surgery technology platform overcomes this affordability versus functionality
    tradeoff via a novel forearm mounted tool configuration and innovations in parallel-kinematic
    virtual center mechanisms that makes the tool input joint coincident with the
    surgeon?s wrist. This results in a natural and intuitive motion transmission from
    the surgeon?s hand to the tool end-effector via a low-cost design that does not
    require any sensors, actuators, or computer-control."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improvement in public health and quality of life through improved methods of medicinal therapy.  The technology developed in this project is aimed at improving the effectiveness of existing therapeutic drugs while facilitating their use by patients in need of treatment, as well as enabling the development of promising new therapeutic agents and regiments that otherwise would not be useful due to the required frequency or complexity of their administration.  As an example, if successful this technology will take a drug requiring daily injection (or multiple injections every day) and convert it to a form that requires injection only once-weekly.  The anticipated societal impact is increased patient compliance together with an improvement in the effectiveness of the treatment, and thus an overall improvement in patient quality of life.  The replacement of existing treatment regimens by more convenient and effective ones is expected to have a substantial commercial impact, as is the enablement of new therapeutics to treat currently untreated or ineffectively-treated conditions.

    The proposed project is aimed at developing a platform technology based on the controlled release of drugs, particularly peptides and proteins, from an injected depot.  Current methods are either incompatible with peptides and proteins due to their mode of manufacture or chemical reactivity, or do not provide the precise control over release and degradation rates that are needed for optimum therapeutic efficiency. The methods proposed will develop a biodegradable hydrogel matrix that is readily injected, that releases a bound drug in a highly controlled manner, and which subsequently dissolves in a highly controlled manner.  The hydrogel matrix provides a protein-friendly environment, and use of ?Ò-eliminative linkers results in precise control of release and degradation kinetics. Technology development will be focused on the chemistry of drug attachment for generalized peptides/proteins as well as the chemistry for the hydrogel matrix itself, but will be exemplified using specific therapeutic peptides having existing therapeutic applications, such as exenatide and GLP-1 that are of immediate applicability to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.  Concomitantly, methods for the in vivo analysis of hydrogel behavior will be developed, and tolerability of the hydrogel matrix will be assessed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The proposed technology could drastically improve the overall effectiveness of pest management programs in various agricultural industries. The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions. This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control. The automated trap?s ability to monitor more than one species of insect not only achieves a higher level of efficiency in pest monitoring but also multiplies the technology?s value to the end users. The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad. In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations. Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs, such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a multi-modal sensor platform for robust detection and classification of multiple insect pest species for automated monitoring of insect populations in production agriculture. The main goal of this project is two-fold: First is to demonstrate that bio-impedance sensor alone provides useful data to classify multiple insect species. A linear support vector machine classifier using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from bio-impedance data will be implemented on an embedded platform for detection and classification of two insect pest species. These bio-impedance based electronic traps will undergo large-scale field trials and be prepared for full commercialization. The second objective is to develop a multi-modal electronic trap with ultrasound, infrared and bio-impedance sensors that can simultaneously monitor four or more insect pest species. Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing. These features will then be used in multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification. Different sensor fusion strategies will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated both in controlled and field conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can strongly influence the healthcare system. The technology of the proposed project has the potential to make a broader impact by decreasing the risk of performing the bone graft harvesting procedure compared to current methods and consequently increase the number of surgeons who choose to collect a patient?s own bone graft in lieu of using inferior bone graft alternatives/substitutes. Furthermore, whereas fewer new, inexperienced surgeons are currently being trained to utilize the patient?s own bone graft because of the risks of current harvesting methods, these surgeons may be encouraged to perform the harvesting procedure with the introduction of the proposed concept. The increase in use of the patient?s own bone will benefit patients because of the widely accepted clinical benefits of autogenous bone graft compared to synthetic or exogenous alternative solutions. The proposed technology may also have a significant commercial impact to hospitals because of potential decreases in operating room time and post-operative patient hospitalization time (compared to the standard harvesting procedure) as well as decreased per-procedure product costs (compared to substitute bone graft products).

    The proposed project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling orthopaedic surgeons to collect bone graft from the patient?s pelvic bone in a minimally invasive manner without the patient morbidity and added surgical time intrinsic to the current standard bone graft harvesting methods. The research objectives of the proposed project are to explore various design enhancements to the minimum viable product and assess the impact of these changes on the value proposition; and to explore adjustments to the minimum viable product and assess their fit for use in additional surgical procedures not accessible by the minimum viable product. These objectives will be completed by investigating various new product features and manufacturing processes as well as testing these concepts in various pre-clinical settings. This project has strong intellectual merit because this transformative technological concept has the potential to disrupt the current methods that surgeons employ for harvesting bone graft by introducing a novel solution that improves patient outcomes, surgical time, and hospital costs.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is multi-fold: First, the proposed tripolar concentric
    ring electrode and instrumentation for acquiring brain signals, tripolar electroencephalography
    (tEEG), is a platform technology that has a variety of medical and commercial
    applications. By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve
    conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers
    have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet
    clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various
    neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape
    and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised
    by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly
    simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders
    (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively
    guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement
    in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance
    the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research
    of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. \n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography
    (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate
    that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional
    EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious
    brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients.
    Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root
    cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the
    interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode
    configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer.
    The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable
    tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians
    will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability
    to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG
    would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical
    and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting
    will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide enhanced vision for patients after cataract surgery.  Current devices, called intraocular lenses (IOLs), can correct certain vision problems.  However, commercially available IOLs do not provide the same restoration of capabilities as other surgeries, such as hip replacements.  In particular, current IOLs do not address the problems of presbyopia which is the continual degradation of the ability to change focus from far to near object which eventually results in the need for reading glasses.  Devices that attempt to address presbyopia, but fail, represent a $500MM current market.  This project has a novel approach to the problem and the opportunity to positively affect the lives of the 3 million people each year that are undergoing cataract surgery.

    The proposed project will continue to push the bounds of our understanding of the mechanisms of human vision control.  Previous work done to measure the forces in the eye used to change vision from near to far objects, will be utilized in the design and testing of an IOL that can truly provide changes in vision like the normal lens of a 30 year old human.  Several iterations of design will be tested in a rhesus monkey model to determine the best way to capture the forces in the eye, the optimal design of the shape of the device and materials used, the choice of optic material, and the procedures to insert and activate the IOL.  All with the objective to turn currently available forces in the eye into refractive changes in eyesight.  The ultimate goal of this project is to have a design that can be used for an FDA application for human clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cornerstone for reliable electricity and a modernized grid able to evolve alongside emerging customer demands. Reliable electricity is key component of an industrialized market, critical for the information age, and an enabler for non-industrialized regions evolution and eventual world economic contribution.  The societal benefit therefore of GridBridge's commercially feasible Grid Energy Router is colossal, as it is the step-function change required to truly orchestrate a grid to match this era.  This project will enable numerous hindered technologies and scientific understanding related to energy storage, photovoltaic and other renewable generation, as well as electric vehicles and their correlated fast chargers.  Energy savings are also a monumental aspect and are expected to be in the trillions of dollars.  Society needs electricity to maintain civilization and an updated grid is imperative for supplying that electricity to an evolved consumer base.  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be the crucial component for the modernized grid an enabler for numerous complementary technologies.  GridBridge's GER will eventually replace millions of installed legacy grid technologies throughout the world.  Furthermore, the continued GridBridge-ERC relationship establishes FREEDM ERC's commercialization ecosystem, which includes 200 diverse students.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project combines various research aspects to commercialize the company?s third breakthrough product for electric utilities, the Grid Energy Router (GER).  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be cornerstone for an evolved grid that can integrate renewables and storage, offer dynamic efficiency gains, and intelligently route power.  Although there has been early work with power electronics merely focusing in the area of high-voltage conversion, the approaches thus far limit commercialization and manufacturability.  GridBridge will combine over three years of company market research and utility voice of the customer, a unique product roadmap, and cutting edge research in the areas of feature implementation and voltage conversion.  Keeping in mind the end market, electric utility requirements have been incorporated: highly efficient, cost-competitive, manufacturable within a specific market window, and scalable both to high power and high voltage.  This project facilitates a cost-effective and electrically-efficient product design ready for industrialization and ultimately grid integration, while simultaneously incorporating valuable features that justify utility expenditure and meet a market window of need.

    interactive question sets, and online tools, along with some text, may replace
    or enhance traditional textbooks, with studies showing significant improvements
    in student engagement and learning outcomes. The project addresses the nationwide
    high dropout rates of STEM students, due in part to outmoded learning materials.
    Such dropout rates not only prevent students from achieving their career goals,
    but result in a shortage of college graduates in nationally-critical STEM fields.
    The project creates novel web-based tools that empower teachers, and even students,
    to straightforwardly contribute new interactive content, thus tapping the latent
    talent and energy of many thousands of people. The project creates automated and
    human-overseen processes that efficiently and effectively percolate the highest-quality
    contributions to the top of lists, enabling content to be created and maintained
    at large scale and low cost. The project's new publishing paradigm can disrupt
    the existing publishing industry. The interactive quality content can increase
    the number of students who successfully graduate in STEM fields, which can strengthen
    the nation's economy and competitiveness. \n\nThe project develops a new web-based
    content authoring and delivery framework that supports a novel curated-crowdsourced
    publishing paradigm. The framework tightly integrates collaborative web-based
    authoring with delivery of animated interactive web-based content. The project
    develops elegant tools for instructors, and even students, to contribute new interactive
    items. Such tools include a novel browser-based animation creation tool, which
    allows powerful animations to be easily and quickly created via any web browser
    without requiring application installation or requiring extensive tool training.
    The project creates and tests new processes that, via a combination of peer evaluations,
    usage data, and assessments, automatically percolate quality contributions to
    the top, for final curation by instructors, authors, or editors. Such percolation
    crowdsourcing can yield superior learning materials, at scale and cost-effectively,
    while simultaneously yielding substantially lower prices than traditional textbooks."

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  Developing a web-based authoring framework for animated
    interactive university STEM web content via curated crowdsourcing'
- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project aims to incorporate novel machine vision
    and social networking functionality into technologies used in online education
    and webinars. Researchers have long identified engagement as the key ingredient
    for success in any learning environment and particularly the online environment,
    but current online teaching systems lack the means by which instructors can gauge
    their students' level of engagement because these students are not visible. Therefore
    in order to improve current online teaching modalities, it is necessary to find
    ways to communicate to the instructor the level of engagement of their unseen
    online students. The successful outcome of the project will allow the lecturer
    to receive real-time feedback from facial expressions, gaze and other body kinesics,
    which when averaged across the virtual classroom, provides feedback related to
    the reception of information delivery. The project supports NSF's mission in education,
    which seeks to answer questions about how teachers can provide effective cognitive
    and motivational support for students. This project aims to promote richer interactions
    between tutor and online students through integrated cognitive and motivational
    scaffolding, leading to higher levels of student success enabling them to compete
    more effectively as skilled artisans in the 21st century workforce. \n \n \nThis
    project contributes four significant innovations: a machine-vision recognition
    system for gaze direction and facial expressions of engagement, which aggregates
    data across participants to improve signal to noise; a machine-vision recognition
    system for detecting hand gestures and postural kinesics; enabling third party
    pedagogical applications within a framework using ancillary hardware, and which
    can be sold through an educational application store; and to integrate social
    network functionality that replicates pre- and post-lecture socialization including
    pair sharing, breakout groups, team teaching, and support for online teaching
    assistance. The goals and scope of research required to support the above innovations
    include: improving machine-vision classifier data and functionality; optimization
    of user interface and integrated user calibration process; extending the system's
    functionality to both synchronous and asynchronous modalities; developing neuro-psychological
    and cognitive models of the online pedagogical process; design and integration
    of content/media interoperability and social networking capabilities; creation
    of open application programming interfaces for third-party developers and application
    store functionality with digital whiteboards and tablets; development of ancillary
    software modules to help students manage data related to their educational efforts,
    diagnose study and achievement patterns, and provide expert advice based on that
    data."

    the development of project management expertise by enabling users to rehearse
    tough, real-world challenges in an immersive, Virtual World environment. Studies
    of expert project managers indicate that their skill was acquired over many years
    and as a result of learning by failure. Accelerating this process would have a
    huge impact on the costs of real world failure. Some studies have estimated the
    organizational losses to upwards of $82 billion annually. These losses are thought
    to be largely preventable with better approaches to project management education.
    The broader/commercial impact of project lies in its ability to 1) lower the risk
    of learning through failure, 2) accelerate the time it takes to effectively train
    novices, and 3) alleviate some of the costs associated with unanticipated mistakes
    made in the real world. Using an immersive, simulation-based, outcomes driven
    rehearsal methodology, this product has the potential to 1) increase the success
    rate of projects for those with limited real-world experience, 2) by allowing
    users to rehearse and test deployment plans without risk and 3) by providing participants
    new to project management an opportunity to encounter tough problems and develop
    solutions under pressure. \n\nThis company's rehearsal method enables teams of
    participants to interact with virtual replicas of actual processes and products
    in the context of an ongoing business with complex goals. The primary innovation
    will be the use of Virtual Worlds to provide rich interactive environments to
    accelerate expertise development among novice project managers. The Virtual Worlds
    environments are enriched with embedded behavior and decision monitoring software
    designed to automate the tracking of progress and provide feedback. Early pilots
    with experts indicate that the method may accelerate expertise development by
    as much as two years. The objective for this project is to refine the approach
    for use with novices by targeting key skills of project management that are normally
    learned through years of experience, and specifically, learning from failure.
    Virtual Worlds also provide an ideal platform to test hypotheses regarding the
    technical implementation, individual engagement and team outcomes in a novice
    population. As such, the project will also resolve a number of questions about
    the key features at play within emerging Virtual Worlds platforms."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims at creating novel methods for analyzing consumer behavior and product acceptance. This project will develop efficient, automated natural language processing (NLP) methods that perform at Web scale to analyze a broad spectrum of consumer experiences with products, as reported in conversations on social media, in consumer reviews, etc. Currently available representations of consumer commentary are relatively shallow. In this project more detailed representations will be built, advancing NLP technology and delivering state-of-the-art analysis of conversations that detail consumer decisions, motivations, and questions about products. In addition, the representations of consumer commentary will be integrated with third-party data, resulting in the development of predictive models of consumer behavior that exceed the accuracy of current models. This will allow product vendors to quantify the influencing factors behind product adoption and attrition, which is crucial to proving marketing hypotheses, predicting business outcomes, and improving customer awareness of product issues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability to improve the analysis and use of consumers' perception and experience of products. Deeper analysis of millions of consumer experiences reported online will help the public, manufacturers, marketers, and regulators alike make better decisions about products. Currently, gaining representative insights about a product requires manual processing of an overwhelming range of information sources. Automatic, in-depth analysis of these disparate sources at Web scale will deliver an unbiased, authoritative stream of quantified product information and consumer opinion, improving consumer experience, product performance, and industry transparency. The richness of the resulting representation will enable an understanding of finer-grained aspects of product performance and consumer behavior, which cannot be extracted or analyzed using existing techniques such as sentiment analysis or topic-modeling. The technology developed in this project will translate to fundamental improvements in the conduct of market research, commercial campaigns and regulatory investigations, as well as enhancing the public's ability to make informed decisions about products.

    aimed at developing commercial redistricting software products that can be used
    by non-experts. Redistricting or rezoning is the process of dividing space into
    districts or zones while optimizing a set of criteria under various spatial constraints.
    It is an extremely challenging task that is commonly needed in many real-world
    problems, such as political and school redistricting, emergency zone design, package
    delivery, and business planning. The company's proposed products will provide
    flexible and easy-to-use software tools to meet the needs of several specific
    niche markets that no existing tools can effectively serve. The objective is to
    expand the user group well beyond technical experts to the average government
    or business professional, and even to the general public, thereby democratizing
    the redistricting process. \n\nThe broader impact of this project is its potential
    to fundamentally change the way redistricting is performed in practice. With existing
    commercial tools, completing a redistricting task usually requires one or more
    full-time technicians working for days or months at a time. With the product being
    created under this project, even a non-technical user may generate a professional
    plan within minutes. Potential clients include governments (cities and counties),
    school districts, consulting firms who provide redistricting services, private
    businesses that need to optimize service delivery, and even general citizens who
    are interested in participating in redistricting decision making. The product
    targets the U.S. and international market, including both public and private sectors."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to fabricate and commercialize Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) that are free from any wavelength limitations imposed by the choice of semiconductor substrate. These revolutionary VCSELs will operate in a single mode with high output power, narrow linewidth and a stable linear polarization for use in spectroscopy and communications. Using 2D photonic crystal structures and substrate-independent reflectors, it is possible to build efficient single mode VCSELs at any wavelength covering the near-infrared and approaching mid infrared (800nm to 2,500nm). High efficiency and high output power are achieved by very low electrical resistance and efficient heat sinking. The first prototype will have the ambitious goal of offering a preferred alternative to DFB lasers in long-haul fiber optic communications and near infrared spectroscopy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes many societal, educational, scientific and commercial benefits.  As a social benefit, the commercialization of this technology will enable faster and simpler air and water contamination measurements, and faster and lower-cost telecommunications. As an educational and scientific benefit, the next generation VCSEL development provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating 2D photonic crystals that are usable for optical signal processing and novel laser designs. Also, the resulting high-efficiency compact lasers with high mode quality can be used for pumping high power solid state lasers; and finally, the high speed versions of these advanced lasers can simplify data communication in fast computer systems used in scientific simulations. As a commercial impact, the additional functionalities of the next generation VCSELs will enable them to break out of their current niche datacom market into broader applications in communications and instrumentation. Their substrate independence will eventually make it possible to process them on silicon and other materials suitable for the final application. This will lead to a significant increase in demand for VCSELs due to the new markets that they will serve.

    antenna technology and wireless network performance by developing a new kind of
    wireless mesh network node, i.e. integrated router, radio and antenna, and the
    software necessary to create a network of such devices. Networking is an important
    productivity resource, but can come at a high cost especially for high-data rates.
    Dramatic capacity gains in urban wireless networks are achieved by deploying directional
    antennas to minimize interference and allow substantial frequency reuse. Indoor
    mounting of nodes in windows is desirable to avoid complications with landlords,
    avoid weather, and decrease RF path loss. Finally, larger antennas produce more
    directionality, so the desired wireless node needs a large surface area and yet
    must be something that people are willing to hang in their windows, i.e. transparent
    and attractive. This project is using transparent conductive coatings with a novel
    combination of beam steering and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radio technology
    to develop a mostly transparent wireless node that achieves a <15 degree wide
    beam that is electronically steerable over >110 degrees. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project includes increased US competitiveness by facilitating
    the spread of high speed Internet access and through the sale of innovative new
    devices in the US and worldwide.  Community networks will deploy these nodes,
    as they are the lowest cost and simplest way to create an inter-building network.
    \ In particular, delivering signals via windows overcomes RF absorption in the
    masonry structures typical of public housing projects. Successful commercialization
    of this technology will significantly reduce the cost and increase the performance
    of urban wireless networks, thus helping extend Internet access to un- and under-served
    neighborhoods and reducing the cost of offloading 3G/4G wireless traffic to local
    Wi-Fi hotspots."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a novel technology that will enable non-surgical treatment of gallstone disease.  Symptomatic gallstone disease occurs when gallstones obstruct the outlet of the gallbladder and prevent the flow of bile.  Obstruction can result in significant pain and if left untreated can lead to dangerous infections.  The most common and effective treatment for gallstone disease today is surgical removal of the gallbladder, or cholecystectomy.  Unfortunately, many patients are not eligible for surgery due to other complicating medical conditions or very old age, and the surgery itself can have complications.  This project will develop a catheter-implanted device contained within the gallbladder to prevent stones from reaching the outlet.  The procedure is quick and requires only local anesthesia, making it safe for elderly and sick patients.  This project will finalize the design of the device, evaluate its safety in an animal study, evaluate its biocompatibility with biologic, chemical, and mechanical tests, and transfer the design to a manufacturable product.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes helping gallstone disease patients who are not eligible for surgery, providing an alternative for patients who prefer not to have surgery, and significantly decreasing overall healthcare costs.  While gallbladder surgery is currently the standard of care for symptomatic gallstone disease, surgery is not without risks ? complications can occur from general anesthesia or the surgical procedure, and post-operative pain and digestive disorders are common.  The new proposed procedure is expected to be faster and safer than the current standard of care. In addition, the proposed device enables patients to keep their gallbladders, maintaining normal digestive function.  Considering the large population of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (approximately 1.3 million annually in the U.S.), the decreased procedure time, recovery time, and overall healthcare costs could be very significant.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a production prototype of an automated nanoscale manufacturing process monitoring tool based on the resonance force microscope (RFM).  The tool will combine image force microscopy (IFM, a version of RFM that measures the linear part of the susceptibility) and scattering near-field optical microscopy (sSNOM) with atomic force microscope for use in the hard disk drive (HDD) and semiconductor industries.  sSNOM measures the dipole-dipole interaction force while IFM measures the dipole-dipole force gradient, both with nanometer spatial resolution.  These techniques allow direct imaging of resonances associated with electrons, phonons, and plasmons.  The capability to image plasmon resonances is well suited to probe the near-field (NF) profile associated with a plasmonic structure called near-field transducer (NFT) utilized in heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR).  With HAMR universally viewed as the next generation technology for HDD industry, the need for a monitoring tool for mass production of HAMR head is acute since there is currently no simple way to probe the NF profile of NFTs.  The objectives of the proposed project are (1) to successfully prototype an automated NFT characterization tool and (2) to field test it with one or more HDD manufacturers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt not only in the HDD industry but across many industries.  While the monitoring of NFT production is the near-term niche application for the automated tool, the same tool will have longer-term value for in-line characterization of physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials and structures in the manufacturing environment of diverse industries, including, for example, the measurement of stress in the channel layer and chemical characterization of defects in semiconductor industry and monitoring of protein-based pharmaceuticals.  In R&D and academic settings, the RFM technique provides the capability to image individual biomolecules in situ, such as for the real-time monitoring of membrane protein dynamics on cells, which will provide unprecedented utility in biomedical and clinical research.  A reliable label-free imaging tool with the capability to identify chemical bond information at the molecular level will potentially bring about revolutionary advances in many fields of basic and applied biological science, including drug discovery, proteomics, structural biology, and personalized medicine.  The RFM technique will be simpler to implement as compared to other hybrid instruments involving high resolution microscopy, resulting in an affordable instrument for academic and research institutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a commercially viable and affordable frequency domain spectral induced polarization (SIP) borehole logging instrument that collects data in fluid-filled boreholes over a wide frequency range with high accuracy/resolution. The SIP technique is a geophysical technology that offers unique information on the physical, chemical and biogeochemical characteristics of Earth materials not provided by existing geophysical logging tools. The opportunity exists to market the tool to the oil, mining and environmental industries, as technical constraints and economical limitations that previously prevented the technology from being commercialized can now be overcome. The primary research objectives are: [1] develop high-performance analog and digital signal processing hardware, software, signal processing algorithms, drive, sense and focusing electrodes; [2] engineer a watertight enclosure and integrate the components into a sonde deployable in a borehole; [3] test instrument performance in laboratory simulations and boreholes at field sites that represent a range of geological conditions. Anticipated technical results include exhaustive evaluation of instrumentation accuracy and spatial resolution by means of numerical and physical modeling and assessment of the behavior of the sonde under a variety of environments and configurations.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies with private industries, government agencies and academia involved in resource exploration (petroleum, mineral and water) and environmental assessment. Borehole deployment of an SIP instrument will permit new information on the variation in the physical, chemical and biogeochemical properties of the Earth to be obtained from logging measurements. Enhanced scientific understanding in hydrogeology, environmental, oil, gas and mineral exploration, carbon dioxide sequestration and geotechnical fields will result from the rich information on variations in Earth properties retrieved with the instrument. Potential societal impacts relate to the contribution of the technology to: [1]  improved resource (petroleum, mineral and water) location and characterization; [2] enhanced long term monitoring of environmental systems in a minimally invasive manner, advancing the state of long term environmental stewardship; [3] improved characterization of Earth formations required by civil engineering disciplines. The availability of this instrument will have immediate and long-lasting commercial impacts in the environmental characterization and remediation sector, as well as in the petroleum, mineral and water exploration sector.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will extend the basic science of linear interference delay effect filters, enabling ultra-wideband tunable RF filters for all types of RF receivers and instrumentation. It will also extend the engineering science of implementing such filters as integrated circuits. And, its distortion filtering aspect will enable enable signal agnostic,adaptive cancellation of wideband, and in-band, interference, for anti-jamming applications as well as to enhance signal quality for the consumer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential is that it will help achieve the national goal of expanding access to RF spectrum by maximizing
    spectral efficiency with its continuous tuning. Second, it reduces filter cost and space requirements while increasing reliability by eliminating increasingly complex filter banks. This will result in smaller, cheaper and more dependable phones for consumers, which will help drive industry growth. Third, the results of this project will deliver Smartphone GPS accuracy rivaling commercial units, as well as enabling protection of GPS-dependent infrastructure against inadvertent or intentional disruption. Fourth, it will enable precise, jamming resistant GPS navigation by aerial drones used by first responders, homeland security and the military, helping prevent crashes that place people at risk.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a new high brightness light engine platform by monolithically integrating high performance silicon transistors with compound semiconductor optoelectronic materials.  Dense arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been previously fabricated to show the opportunity of using such arrays in microdisplay and projection concepts.  However, without active control circuits, the ultimate brightness and resolution are limited.  The technology developed in this SBIR uniquely allows for the fabrication of LED arrays with integrated control circuits on a single substrate enabling a light engine platform with high peak brightness, high dynamic range, and high efficiency.  Prototype LED arrays and transistor devices have been fabricated, and the next step to realize this platform is the development of advanced silicon circuitry to directly control the LED arrays and color generation methods to achieve full-color displays.  The anticipated results of this project are on-chip driving circuits and development of color generation methods which will be integrated with arrays of LEDs to form a commercially-ready prototype.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a light engine with a power efficiency, brightness, cost, and form factor unavailable in incumbent systems.  In particular, three markets are identified where this technology significant advantages over current technologies.  These include the microdisplay market, the pico projector market, and the projector market.  This light engine platform offers a small form factor, long lifetime, environmental robustness, high energy efficiency, and the high brightness required for sunlight readability.  These features are necessary to create truly ubiquitous display devices and enable new see-through augmented reality experiences or smaller, more integrated portable projectors, not possible with current technologies.  Commercialization of this device will impact all of these areas and also enable a range of new downstream applications including other non-display industries, such as, 3D scanning and novel user interfaces.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop software and a system that enables nearly automatic generation and maintenance of a global database of indoor maps through crowdsourcing and data fusion. The current state of the art in indoor mapping relies on a manual labor-intensive process to create and maintain maps as they change over time, which is difficult to scale. A dynamic map-building system will address the challenge of generating and updating key indoor map navigation data. The developed mapping software will use existing embedded Smartphone sensors to discover building features (such as hallways, elevators, exits, and stairwells) and their connectivity as a user walks through a building while carrying a Smartphone running the mapping application.  Additional building signature information is collected as part of the map. The user's location, which is simultaneously being tracked using the same sensors, is used to identify the location of the discovered building features. The map accuracy and completeness will increase as the number of users increase.  This indoor map database will be used for improved indoor location and routing.

    The broader/commercial impact of the mapping software is that it will enable map coverage to increase beyond high use environments such as malls, airports, and museums.  The dynamic map-building system enables maps to be easily extended to include all commercial buildings and to help address the challenge of maintaining and updating indoor map navigation data as they change over time.  The data produced by the system will complement and integrate with indoor map data being made available by leading indoor map suppliers. Indoor maps can be used to power a wide array of applications, and they are clearly essential for making location-based applications work. These applications include consumer applications as well as critical safety applications. Locating people (including children) in emergency situations becomes possible if the software can both calculate their location and show it on a clear map that includes essential floor plan data that makes it easy to reach them. Navigating out of a building in an emergency is possible if the open pathways, stairwells, entrances, and exits are clearly marked on a map.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop low-temperature ion source (LoTIS) technology which uses laser-cooling to create a beam of Cs+ ions with high brightness and low energy spread. This technology will extend the utility of focused ion beam (FIB) instrumentation that is widely used for nanometer-scale precision machining tasks; it accomplishes this by addressing shortcomings in precision and speed afforded by commercially available ion sources. One primary research aim of this project is the measurement of a key ion source performance metric, namely brightness, in order to compare its value to that of incumbent ion source technologies. LoTIS may have a brightness that is tenfold to one hundred-fold larger than the industry standard liquid metal ion source.  An ion source with such an improved brightness would enable superior machining precision at higher speeds over a broader range of ion beam operating energies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop improved FIB instrumentation to empower users in a variety of research fields and industrial applications, including nanotechnology, biotechnology, semiconductor manufacturing, and energy exploration. In particular, nanomachining applications, including integrated circuit edit and rapid prototyping of nanoscale device structures, are increasingly limited by the precision afforded by current ion source technology, and the users in these areas are in need of higher-precision FIBs. FIBs employed for transmission electron microscope lamellae preparation require less precision but could benefit from reduced subsurface ion damage provided by this method, through the use of Cs+ ions at low energy. A bright source of Cs+ ions could also dramatically improve the resolution and throughput for spatially-resolved elemental mapping in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) applications. This technique represents an order-of-magnitude ion source performance improvement that will address FIB user needs across a wide spectrum of scientific and commercial applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will revolutionize the manufacture of ultrahigh precision, x-ray diffraction gratings. Mechanically ruled, x-ray gratings are used at synchrotron radiation and free-electron laser facilities, where they define the wavelength of x-rays used for chemical analysis and imaging studies in the fields of photovoltaics, electronic materials, catalysis, structural biology, environmental science, and others, serving a wide variety of industries and academic disciplines. This effort will advance a new approach to fabricating such gratings that uses a pair of atomic force microscopes (AFMs) operating in tandem - one for scribing and the other for in situ imaging. This combination provides unprecedented control over feature shape and positioning, and will allow scribing of features with nm-scale precision over areas exceeding 400 square centimeters. If successful, the result will be a new approach to fabricating holographic optics for use not only at synchrotron and free-electron laser facilities, but for a variety of other applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the fact that, between 2009 and 2011, a crisis occurred in the x&#8208;ray grating market. The only two world suppliers of mechanically ruled gratings ceased to take orders, either because their technology was obsolete or because of severe infrastructure problems.  This vanishing of world capacity has taken place when demand for x&#8208;ray gratings is at an all-time high and growing. Extensive market research via direct communication with x-ray facilities has revealed a current need for 430 gratings worldwide, which at a sale price of $60,000 implies a global market opportunity of approximately $26 million. If successful, it should be possible to capture this market and bring this area of manufacturing back to the U.S.  Gratings aside, this project presents a new approach to creating holographic optics that could enable new technologies based on the engineering of customized, optical wave fronts. This approach can scribe curved lines, forming arcs or ellipses, providing lateral focusing, or exhibiting topological defects that create electromagnetic vortices having high angular momentum. These features may find use in microscopy, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, or the creation of masters for the mass market for optical grating replicas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a bio-inspired contact lens that closely mimics the structure of natural tear film, and prevents contact lens-induced dry eye disease (CLIDE).  CLIDE is a serious problem faced by 50% of contact lens wearers. In spite of advances in materials and lens design, an estimated 10% of patients discontinue use each year due to CLIDE symptoms of dryness and discomfort. The architecture of the proposed lens minimizes tear film disruption through the use of a high water content polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel that interfaces with the ocular environment. The unique multi-layered design will enable a new paradigm in contact lens design, which so far has relied on modifying copolymer blends rather than making use of discrete layers of bulk materials.  The objectives of this research project are to develop and optimize scalable manufacturing processes to produce the lenses and validate their safety in animals. The results of this project will enable efficacy studies in human subjects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a contact lens that alleviates dryness and discomfort.   The global contact lens market is $6.8 billion dollars annually, with an estimated $680 million dollars in revenue lost from patients discontinuing lens wear due to discomfort. In addition to the significant commercial potential, and ability to improve patient comfort, development of this contact lens will have broader impacts in the ophthalmology and medical device fields. Through better understanding of the tear film-lens interactions, more reliable, objective, and quantifiable metrics to predict success and segment patients will be possible. The new lens architecture also may enable a better understanding of the various metrics used in comparing the comfort of contact lenses.  In addition, this device will validate the use of this unique material/design for other potential medical device applications.  The novel processes and technology under development in this project for thin film hydrogel deposition has broad application both in clinical science and fundamental research.

    address the need for analyzers to detect the toxic species benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
    xylene, (BTEX) and 1,3-butadiene in ambient air. These toxic volatile organic
    compounds (VOC) are released during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, the
    manufacture of a range of chemicals, and the process of petrochemical refining.
    Entanglement Technologies proposes to complete development of a BTEX and butadiene
    vapor analyzer based on the combination of cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)
    and diffusion time-of-flight (DiTOF). CRDS provides extremely sensitive detection
    while diffusion provides specificity. The research objective of this project is
    to demonstrate the full capabilities of this analyzer technology. The project
    will comprise building a prototype CRDS/DiTOF analyzer to perform laboratory and
    field trials of the technology. The anticipated benzene sensitivity is 10 parts
    per trillion by volume in a measurement of less than 10 minutes, surpassing existing
    technologies. The outcome of the project will be a design for a manufacturable

    extend the sensitivity of state-of-the-art commercial CRDS analyzers have for
    small molecules (e.g. carbon dioxide or ammonia) to the detection of more complex
    molecules. DiTOF provides the ability to distinguish among larger molecules (benzene
    and other aromatics, aldehydes and ketones) that CRDS alone does not possess.
    The CRDS/DiTOF analyzer design developed in this project will be Entanglement
    Technologies? commercial platform design, easily adapted to many different trace

    of trace gases. Such a family of analyzers will impact pollution research, control,
    and mitigation as much as existing commercial carbon dioxide, methane, and water
    CRDS analyzers are currently impacting the study of greenhouse gases and climate
    change. In the long term, CRDS/DiTOF technology will be applied to biomedical
    science, industrial process monitoring, environmental remediation and explosives
    detection. For example, the diffusion-based selectivity will prove critical to
    the separation and quantification of the many hydrocarbon gas components in human
    breath useful for non-invasive diagnosis of disease. Similarly, CRDS/DiTOF can
    enable sensitive chemical analysis of liquids such as blood."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project should offer a radically new alternative to enterprises for application mobilization.  The key value proposition is the ability for companies to mobilize their applications at a fraction of the cost and time as compared to any competitive offering.  From a technology standpoint, the project consists of a cloud-based backend that allows for the original PC version (browser-based or thick-client-based) of enterprise applications to be run, a front-end app that runs on the mobile devices, and a purpose-built remote computing protocol called MORPH.  The protocol is specifically designed to dynamically transform the application views in a manner that make them appropriate for smartphones and tablets.  The platform enables mobilization without requiring any software development, mobilizes applications instantaneously, offers a unified mobilization platform for all of an enterprise's applications, and enables feature parity controllable by the enterprise.  MORPH composes of two underlying technologies:  1) virtual view that virtualizes application views independent of the UI framework used into a set of UI elements and attributes that can be easily manipulated, and 2) transformation services that can be programmed onto the StarMobile platform to operate on the virtual view to realize a mobile device friendly view.

    The broader / commercial impact of this project is that a company can take any current enterprise applications and extend them to users on any mobile devices at 5% to 20% of the cost and time of any other solution on the market today.  This should benefit the 85% of enterprise knowledge workers who are expected to have smartphones within the next few years.  A recent survey of CIOs revealed that there are multiple drivers for application mobilization - the key ones being increased productivity of employees, higher revenue, and reduced paper work.  Over 90% of IT managers in a recent survey indicated plans for application mobilization.  Typical customers for StarMobile include Global 2000 businesses that use on-premise, web-based and / or cloud-based applications, packaged or bespoke, to support their business processes.  While there is an urgent demand for application mobilization, there are no reliable, cost-effective solutions that can perform mobilization rapidly.  Thus, there is a need for a solution that can achieve rapid mobilization with minimal effort on the part of the enterprise and at the same time provide the rich set of functionality that is required.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the rapidly growing threats to endpoint security from attacks and data loss over USB. At present, virtually all USB security measures are located as software on the host or as a secured physical device. Neither of these approaches is truly capable of addressing the vulnerability as a whole - software solutions can be bypassed and a physical peripheral device cannot secure the data that is transmitted on the bus. The proposed technology is located next to the host, so it is capable of securing the entire bus. Our specific technical objectives include the construction of a security device capable of stopping representative attacks in the USB Threat Model that are not solved by existing solutions. Such a device would enable a disruptive improvement in the field of USB cybersecurity. The anticipated results for proposed project will be the development of the product for deployment to customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a disruptive change to USB security. USB security has become critical for many organizations with secure networks, especially healthcare, financial, and defense institutions. The number of data loss incidents over USB has exploded with the availability of smart devices and tablets. USB attacks compromised Predator drones in 2011 using USB drives, and the Military has implemented USB bans, degrading productivity and increasing costs. Despite USB bans, attacks and data loss over USB continue. The proposed device is capable of providing unprecedented levels of security to USB and a framework to build future security infrastructure. To stimulate continued innovations in security and mobile devices markets, we plan to open our platform to the greater scientific and commercial community to develop the next generation of algorithms to stop attacks and data loss over USB. Since our device provides access to USB data with an API, it can enable students and professionals to rapidly ramp up their understanding of USB without the need of expensive hardware and proprietary software. Our device can be integrated inside PCs and smart devices, which would impact the security of every computer, smart device, networks and the ?cloud?.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a novel self-sealing materials technology for the primary application of designing durable blood access systems for hemodialysis patients.  Nearly 580,000 people in the United States alone have end stage renal disease (ESRD), and over 400,000 people are treated using hemodialysis as the primary mode of treatment.  Current access systems are neither designed for repeated access nor managing bleeding after hemodialysis treatment, and as a result commonly lead to secondary complications.  The research aims of the proposal are to:  1) Develop manufacturing methods for device production, 2) Determine biocompatibility of the materials technology, and 3) Develop an animal model to evaluate potential clinical impact.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will yield a unique and novel material that will create a paradigm shift from the treatment of complications due to hemodialysis to prevention.  This will address clinical market needs and shift reimbursement policies to create better clinical outcomes and contain costs.  Currently, $27 billion is spent on the delivery of hemodialysis treatment for ESRD patients.  The materials technology under development will lead to vascular access devices suitable for nearly the entire hemodialysis patient population, thereby creating an estimated addressable market size of more than $500 million.  This research will enhance scientific understanding by introducing novel engineering and manufacturing methods for a broad range of applications beyond hemodialysis where repeated access and reliable sealing is required.

    This Small Business Innovations Research Phase (SBIR) II project is to support the continued development of using proprietary perfusion decellularization technology to create a fully revascularized cardiac patch for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and congenital heart repair. Current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow and remodel with the patient.  Feasibility will be demonstrated by in-vitro and in-vivo characterization to create a perfusable cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch to promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to native cardiac tissue.  This product will have significant advantages over existing technologies, including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies. Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, revascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the development of a revascularized cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair in a way that is superior to existing technologies.  While medical advancements have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction patients, therapeutic options are lacking to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue, resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% at five years. Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on lowering this mortality rate and reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion annually. The use of this product will further enhance the medical and scientific understanding of the mechanisms by which damaged cardiac tissue may be restored/repaired and patient life may be extended following myocardial infarction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel computer vision based plant identification system for commercialization in agricultural weed control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical herbicides, a global $20B market. Existing computer vision based approaches can segment a 'splotch' of green vegetation from a brown background but are unable to provide the selectivity and precision necessary for mechanized, automated weeding. This project's objective is to create software algorithms that match the capability of the human eye and brain to quickly and reliably classify plants into crops and weeds in real-time. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a hierarchical classifier. This classifier will utilize a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that uses point-of-interest rather than shape-based methods, a novel approach to visual object identification. The result of this research will be the creation of an algorithm integrated into an automated weeding system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant, as the development of an alternative to chemical intensive agricultural weed control will impact technological understanding, create commercial opportunity, and positively impact society. Technologically, the project will advance the fields of computer vision and machine learning through development of a real-time, automated plant identification system based on point-of-interest and SVMs. Commercially, the system will offer conventional farmers an effective and chemical-free method to eliminate weeds, and it will offer organic farmers the first truly precise organic weed control method. The addressable market for weed control in food production is estimated to be $4B in the U.S. The system's ability to eliminate the use of chemical herbicides has a profound societal effect. U.S. farmers apply over 250M pounds of herbicide annually on corn and soybeans alone, with many unintended and detrimental side effects. Chemical concentrations in rivers, lakes and groundwater are rising, and the prevalence of herbicide resistant weeds is growing exponentially. An alternative to these chemicals limits society's exposure while protecting environmental integrity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a low-cost 10kW micro-turbine power generator that provides the basis for portability, fuel flexibility, and reduced maintenance of conventional turbo-machines at a cost that is competitive with reciprocating engines.  Current micro-turbines have prohibitively high costs due to complicated geometry and materials, but the proposed research will develop a micro-turbine with significantly lower manufacturing costs using a novel layered stackable architecture for the core micro-turbine engine.  The primary research objectives are 1) to optimize micro-turbine components within the framework of the new proposed geometry using a combination of in-house numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics, 2) to design application-specific peripherals and user interface for power generation at oil and gas wells - the proposed entry market, and 3) to build and test a field-ready prototype to validate the engine design and benchmark engine performance.  The result of the proposed project is a compact, and low-maintenance 10kW micro-turbine power generator that will be produced for lower than $500 per kW.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is greatly increased commercial viability of micro-turbine power generators.  The primary advantages of micro-turbines are portability, fuel flexibility, and low maintenance.  Micro-turbines do not have significant market share due to prohibitively high upfront costs, but the proposed technology will bring costs down and enable micro-turbines to gain significant traction in many markets, including emergency response, oil and gas well power generation, and other remote/distributed power generation applications. Due to their portability, micro-turbine generators can be deployed quickly in emergency situations.  Due to their fuel flexibility, implementing micro-turbines can significantly reduce the costs associated with the fuel supply chain, for example, associated gases that would otherwise be flared at oil/gas wells can be used to power equipment onsite.  Due to their low maintenance, microturbines can be adopted where operating costs can be prohibitive for reciprocating engines.  Lastly, the proposed project will lead to reduced carbon footprint by efficiently using fuel that would be otherwise wasted (as in the case of flare gas), reduce other toxic emissions via more efficient combustion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will perfect a proprietary batch-scale processing technique for fabricating ultrahard and ultrasharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips.  The new process involves two steps.  First, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to coat the tips with a chemically inert, highly conductive, and extremely hard material. Second, a patented process that we have developed, field directed sputter sharpening (FDSS), sharpens the probe tip to atomic dimensions (1- 4 nm radius of curvature at the tip apex).  Hard, sharp tips are of considerable scientific and market interest because tip geometry and mechanical properties significantly impact the results of AFM measurements. The current project will carry out research to perfect a batch wafer-scale process able to manufacture hundreds of tips at once.  In order to bring the technique to market, the following research and development tasks will be carried out: (a) optimization of process conditions to reproducibly sharpen arrays of AFM probes fabricated on 4-inch wafers, (b) investigation of the ability to coat and sharpen AFM probes with a variety of hard film materials, and (c) assessment of the performance of batch-fabricated probe tips for market-driven probe microscopy applications.

    The broader/commercial impact of the project arises from the development of robust, reproducible, and durable tips that are more resistant to wear (due to the high hardness) and have favorable characteristics for AFM imaging (small radius of curvature, controlled aspect ratio, and electrically conductive). The project will benefit the academic and industrial communities who use scanning probe microscopy imaging. Although AFM and related probe microscopies have many advantages over electron microscopy (e.g., they can be used under ambient conditions and they can be easily interfaced with optical spectroscopy), one significant drawback is that the probe tips have limited lifetimes owing to wear during use. The development and commercial introduction of probe tips that are ultrasharp, very hard, conductive, and relatively inexpensive will significantly enhance the capabilities of AFM and related techniques such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), a technique of great interest to the microelectronics industry because it is useful for the on-board testing of integrated circuits for delay faults. The research will also be of benefit to those who image insulating surfaces such as polymers and other soft materials where static charge build-up limits efficacy, and to those developing multi-tip probe arrays for lithographic and nanomanufacturing applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will enable a completely new approach to biology. The fundamental unit of biology is the single cell, and each cell contains complex genetic machinery. Many fundamental questions could be answered if biologists could perform genetic analysis on large numbers of single cells derived from tissues. The vast majority of useful applications would require detection of multiple genetic loci in single cells. For example, immunologists would like to measure co-expression of multiple T cell receptors and inflammatory molecules in hundreds of thousands of single T cells circulating in human blood. Currently, biology lacks elegant tools to perform this type of analysis. The current project aims to solve this problem with an innovative approach for analysis multiple genetic loci in hundreds of thousands of single cells analyzed in parallel. The technology uses a device to isolate single cells into aqueous-in-oil picoliter microdroplets, amplifies and links two or more genetic loci by intermolecular hybridization, and then sequences linked loci in reversed emulsions by next-generation sequencing. This enables far more complicated biological analysis than is possible if analyzing only a single locus in a single cell, or a single locus across many single cells.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes commercial applications in genetics and immunology research as well as molecular diagnostics and pharmaceutical development. Immunology researchers worldwide are eager to understand T cell and B cell immune repertoires. Immune repertoires respond to factors such as infectious disease, age, and obesity, so immune repertoire profiling is of great interest worldwide. The innovation of this proposed research is to link subunits of antibody genes to reveal a more complete immune repertoire profile. A similar method could be used to link subunits of T cell receptor genes. The platform will also enable unique and innovative approaches to a number of currently intractable problems in molecular diagnostics, including noninvasive monitoring of immunotherapy, noninvasive monitoring of autoimmune disease, and inflammatory response to allograft procedures. Finally, T cells and antibodies are increasingly used as therapy for disease, and immune repertoire profiling technology will be critical to the development of such therapies. In summary, the technology developed in this project will be marketed to research immunologists, leading to fundamental improvements in our understanding of immunology. Eventually, the technology could be extended to the fields of molecular diagnostics and immune therapy, which could help cure intractable diseases.

    tissue engineering for the preparation of scaffolds for topical wound care, the
    few commercialized products are costly in preparation, storage and use, and are
    subject to degradation and loss of activity. With the success of this project,
    a new technology will be developed that significantly improves burn treatment,
    is based upon readily synthesized, stable polymers in a commercially-available
    solvent, that provides a transparent, water-insoluble, oxygen- and water-vapor
    permeable coating suitable for use over large area burn wounds without forming
    a patch-work design, and which self-removes as the wound heals."

    This project researches and develops a novel mathematics communication and collaboration system. Mathematics is the foundation of Science and Technology, and national competence in the STEM fields is essential to maintaining our competitive edge on a global scale. Math literacy hinges on effective communication of mathematical concepts and processes. However, despite significant advances in pedagogical methods, the way we communicate mathematics remains curiously behind the times. Preliminary customer and market research has revealed that the lack of adequate communication tools for mathematical and technical expressions is holding back the advance of mathematics in online environments such as online tutoring. Moreover, the scarcity of effective communication tools has reinforced the long-standing preconception that math is primarily a solitary activity, and it has created an unintended and harmful selection bias restricting the diversity of students entering STEM fields. This project fills the void of adequate math communications tools with an dynamic, interactive system for communicating mathematical derivations in real-time in an online environment. The system facilitates student-student and student-teacher remote communication of mathematics, and it is particularly suited for student-tutor communication on online tutoring platforms.

    The math communication and collaboration system this project develops leverages the company's proprietary equation manipulation technology. This system employs an integrated math engine and a touch-based interface allowing users to manipulate equations using simple drag-and-drop gestures. It is built on a game-engine allowing for multi-player support. This project integrates the equation manipulation technology into a networked multi-user interface to connect one or more users for real-time communication of mathematical derivations. The project researches the precise needs of students, teachers, and online tutors to tailor the user interface to the specific needs of online mathematics communication. Specific problems the project researches include multi-player networking and matchmaking functionality, optimal network architecture for the system, transfer of control between users for effective communication, integration of traditional communication tools within the system, and reduction of latency time to enhance real-time interactivity. Successful completion of the project will result in a first-of-its-kind math communication system that allows users in different places to connect online and communicate a mathematical derivation as it is happening, and as easily as if they were in the same room. The primary project deliverable is a minimum viable product to be piloted and vetted through the company?s existing math app.

    diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by improving eye contact. Children with
    Autism Spectrum Disorder do not make eye contact readily and eye contact is a
    key component in progressing social behavior. Current methodologies to assist
    these children in maximizing their capabilities are out of reach for many, costing
    families thousands of dollars a month, requiring 25-40 hours per week and offer
    measureable improvements at less than 47%. This project has shown positive results
    in preliminary testing and is expected to result in an affordable, practical solution
    to the challenges children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their families encounter.
    As their social skills improve, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder will be
    able to build and maintain friendships, become more fully engaged in society,
    prepare them to become self-sustaining adults, and increase their employment opportunities.
    Additionally, this program can also be expanded to children with other disabilities
    or children without disabilities, resulting in increased ability to also build
    and maintain friendships, become more fully engaged in society to prepare them
    to become self-sustaining adults, and increase their employment opportunities.
    Potential customers will include parents, school districts, and other professional
    and nonprofessional caregivers. The high need for this program will create market
    growth, creating new jobs and generating tax revenue. \n\nThe goal for this project
    is to develop a multi-sensory program, developed for smart mobile devices, that
    improves children with Autism Spectrum Disorder?s social skills so they can function
    as their typical peers who do not have Autism Spectrum Disorder. This goal is
    accomplished by developing an interactive program that teaches the social skill,
    making eye contact with individuals the child does and does not know, by improving
    sensory integration and regulating the overactive amygdala. Funding would allow
    for the development of the program to test, measure and quantify sensory integration
    and eye contact improvement for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Analyses
    will reflect the interpretation requirements of a Pre vs. Post, Intervention versus
    Control design. All statistical analyses and tests will be conducted using the
    widely used program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17 or
    higher and will be verified with Statistical Analysis System when appropriate

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

    This project will enable students to learn difficult science concepts using a collaborative gaming approach that aims to significantly increase student engagement and understanding. This game is being developed to improve the instruction of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are required curriculum for high school students in life science courses. These processes are largely invisible, comprised of a complex and interdependent set of interactions, and difficult to teach. By creating educationally sound interactive tools to undertake complicated science subjects, the project aims to increase secondary student involvement and interest in STEM, and to help build the core scientific knowledge and higher-order thinking skills they will need to address the challenges of the 21st Century. The app content and design is based on evidence-based pedagogical approaches to effective science instruction. Developing a more immersive and practicable learning method upholds the NSF's mission to promote exceptional science education and will help attract and prepare more students for STEM-based careers. This work will provide teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enable them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensure that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed national and state-level life science standards.

    The project proposes to develop and implement a working simulator that produces scientifically accurate output for a virtual lab learning environment, with which students can quickly build practical understanding of the scientific method through trial and error. This enables a) the introduction of legitimate agency into student learning so that their choices drive the learning, b) the generation of meaningful (non-generic) instructional prompts that respond precisely to how each individual interacts with the game, and c) the establishment of a valuable framework for assessing student learning based on their multiple authentic interactions with the simulator. The simulator will represent biological processes using a mathematical model in order to support an arbitrary range of hypotheses. Additional innovations include a) automated tools that differentiate instruction at the classroom level to help teachers address a range of student proficiencies, from remedial to advanced, b) expanded device-to-device student interactions that utilize collaborative assessments and argumentation games, c) app management tools that enable teachers to organize, monitor and assess individual student participation within these collaborative activities, and d) the integration of relevant geohistorical climate data into each player's "reward garden" in order to build aptitude and foster interest in quantitative analysis activities. Classroom testing will be conducted to validate our approach and demonstrate efficacy.

    This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

    The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.

    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

- abstractText: "This project will address key research and development issues necessary
    to advance the commercialization of an innovative software platform for detailed
    and accurate group discussion of video material. Communication around video is
    a major problem, because the social and content channels are disconnected. Collaboration
    currently happens through email or shared text documents that are separated from
    the relevant segments in the video being discussed. This disconnect hampers in-depth
    communication and leads to errors. This project's focus is to integrate video
    content and collaborative discussion on the same page with multiple annotation
    features so that discussion and collaboration can be as detailed and efficient
    as with a shared text document. The increasing importance and proliferation of
    video in the educational arena and other domains strategically places this project
    at the vanguard of scientific discovery in building a technology tool that will
    serve society. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces
    where videos are used by individuals or groups as part of training, analysis or
    assessment such as corporate/manufacturing, legal/criminal justice, medical and
    others. The project holds a patent and is situated as a spin-out from a university.
    It has unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus
    generating tax revenue and creating jobs.  \n\nThis project focuses on the development
    of a commercial-ready Video Collaboratory platform for team-based learning and
    collaboration centered on video documents for the Lightweight Teams model for
    group learning. This project will develop support tools for the management of
    teams of learners, mechanisms for inter-team collaboration, selective cross-team
    propagation of annotations, and team-based analytics, including instructor dashboard
    metrics for video engagement monitoring. The goal of the project is to address
    knowledge gaps identified in tools to support video-centered collaboration, targeting
    the flipped classroom model for STEM higher education. In this context it is essential
    to understand and support best practice mechanisms for automated group creation,
    bidirectional discourse proliferation for large class sizes and measurement of
    engagement and effectiveness for video content. The project's subaward team will
    be responsible for development and testing of technical feasibility aspects of
    the proposed research milestones. For each of the research milestones, the team
    will analyze the data from prototype deployments at the University and from other
    beta testers. Formative evaluation will be conducted through analysis of log files,
    informal interviews and focus groups with beta testers. Based on the feedback,
    a coded prototype will be created and tested on the test server before final deployment
    to the production system."

    is to develop and incorporate (1) a dynamic survey engine that encourages a collaborative
    approach to engage patients and providers to securely exchange health data, and
    to communicate clearly the action plan preferences of an intervention, and (2)
    a data analytics algorithm that will utilize dynamic survey feedback provided

- abstractText: "This project intends to design and develop a programmable electronics
    and robotics kit that catalyzes the learning of computational thinking, engineering
    design, and making at a price point that will be affordable for large numbers
    of elementary school classrooms throughout the nation. Such an educational robotics
    kit benefits society by positively influencing science, technology, engineering,
    and math (STEM) education and, thereby, encouraging students from diverse backgrounds
    to enter the technology innovation workplace, spurring innovation and entrepreneurism
    in the nation. This project aims to create an authentic, affordable STEM curricular
    tool by combining low-cost technologies already in the marketplace, but in a novel
    manner. These technologies include wireless communications systems now available
    on low-cost touch tablets, as well as powerful, inexpensive microprocessors that
    enable small, custom hardware kits to communicate with such tablets. By combining
    the sensing of environmental values such as light and sound levels with motors,
    lights and other output expressions, this kit will provide a chance for students
    to think at the systems level. They will create interactive sculptural robots
    and connect systems thinking to programming, engineering, and design, all of which
    are lifelong skills for the STEM-focused future. \n\nThis project combines wireless
    communication, tablets, and embedded microcontroller technologies to converge
    on an interactive system for specifying the behavior of a responsive, environmental-sensing
    robot and to then lock the resulting behavior onboard the microcontroller, creating
    a programmable, responsive robot system for education at the lowest cost possible.
    Robot-to-robot communication is effected using mesh networking, enabling sensor
    sharing and synchronization of action across robots in a classroom. A newly designed
    drag-and-drop programming interface on the tablet screen demonstrates the basic
    concepts of feedback control systems and directly programs the embedded microprocessor.
    Uploading of the feedback control system specification directly to the microprocessor,
    in turn, enables autonomous operation of the robot without the need for a dedicated
    programming tablet at all times. This project makes use of participatory design,
    interaction design, hardware architecture, firmware programming, and supply chain
    analysis to arrive at a usable system that can be produced in large quantities
    as appropriate for national and international demand. The participatory design
    portion of this work will include direct, collaborative pilots deployed in local
    schools; professional development opportunities for participating teachers; and
    formative evaluations of hands-on robotic activities, with prototypes, in classrooms.
    This project will lead directly to the commercialization of a bridge product that
    combines features of the final educational robotics kit with a working tablet
    app suitable for immediate use in elementary school classrooms."

    This project will develop a platform that leverages Colytix? existing app and user base to create a transformative technology capable of addressing the massive gap in student retention among community college and part-time students.  College education is seen as one of the primary drivers of economic success for US citizens and therefore directly impacts on the welfare of citizens and the health of the overall economy.  Community colleges received significant attention in 2015 after President Barack Obama proposed to make community college tuition free to many residents of the US in his State of the Union Address. Once implemented, this plan would increase enrollment at community colleges dramatically, but would likely only exacerbate current poor graduation and retention rates if no changes to the status quo are implemented.  This project will provide a key technology to help to realize these goals across the country.

    An innovative combination of technology, interaction design, and educational theory will be used to enable collaboration between students as well as their faculty and mentors. The ultimate goal of the project is to create an individualized platform that breaks each student?s long term goals down into manageable, short term, individualized targets while providing a community of other students and faculty to monitor progress, provide encouragement, and provide timely and appropriate interventions when necessary. This approach will address all of the key factors in low student retention and provide a clear pathway to success for each individual student. The initial focus of the project will be on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in community colleges, but the underlying principles of the platform can be applied to any discipline across any geography and/or institution.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative
    Research (SBIR) project will be to provide the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
    research community with improved models that will accelerate the discovery of
    the next generation of drugs targeting fat metabolism.  Currently, over one in
    every three American adults are obese and the incidence of childhood obesity continues
    to climb.  Obesity is now recognized as a world-wide epidemic which will impact
    many if not all nations.  In the coming decades, it will be critical to develop
    more effective therapies for obesity and its associated problems, diabetes, heart
    disease, high blood pressure and stroke.  Obesity is caused by an overgrowth of
    the body's fat cells.  Unlike current models that rely heavily on mouse fat cells,
    the proposed \"humanized fat-on-a-chip\" technology will provide scientists with
    a research model that closely approximates the clinical conditions that face doctors
    and their patients every day.  By working with human fat cells in a three dimensional
    structure resembling the actual human tissue, the proposed platform has the potential
    to impact the pace of new drug discovery and the cost of health care delivery
    for disease prevention and treatment.  \n\nThis SBIR project proposes to develop
    a \"humanized fat-on-a-chip\" drug discovery platform targeting drugs for fat
    metabolism. The pharmaceutical industry currently lacks a robust human fat tissue
    model, and continues to use less reliable mouse models.  As a result, the obesity
    and diabetes drug discovery pipeline remains blocked.  To address this need, the
    proposed project will combine human cells with protein scaffolds to pioneer a
    tissue engineered fat pad.  The objectives are to 1) evaluate the human cells
    and scaffolds separately to confirm the identity and function; 2) combine the
    human cells with the scaffold and perform assays in vitro to demonstrate that
    they can mimic the function of actual human fat; and 3) transplant the human cell/scaffold
    constructs into mice for 8 weeks to show that the tissue engineered fat pad will
    work under \"real life\" conditions.  It is anticipated that the human cell/scaffold
    constructs will display the metabolic features associated with human fat.  With
    this proof-of-concept data, the next step will be to create tissue engineered
    fat pads that display not only healthy but unhealthy (diabetes, obesity) metabolic
    patterns for use in drug screening and discovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a sustainable, secure, and low-cost supply of established and emerging plant-based medicines. The class of molecules targeted for microbial biosynthesis are the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, a diverse group of plant therapeutics that includes the pain-relieving opioids and the anti-cancer noscapinoids. Approximately 100,000 hectares of opium poppy are grown annually to extract more than 800 tons of opiate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This process diverts land use from food crops and consumes horticultural supplies including water, pesticides, herbicides, and nitrogen- and phosphorus-fertilizers. The existing supply chain suffers further vulnerabilities due to crop susceptibility to climate and disease, restricted growing seasons, and the logistical and security concerns associated with transporting poppy materials across the globe. This project will develop technology to manufacture medicinal opioids and plant-based medicines by yeast fermentation. The technology will allow for year-round, market-responsive production of valuable APIs in secure, local bioreactor facilities. An independent technoeconomic model shows yeast-based production will lower the cost of opiates by 10-50 fold. Furthermore, this technology will provide for diversification into the biosynthesis of rare and novel molecules for drug discovery, with indications spanning cancer, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases.

    This SBIR project proposes to develop baker's yeast as a scalable production system for medicinal opiates and related plant therapeutics. While much effort has been directed to establishing yeast strains that make high levels of other plant-specialized metabolites, such as terpenoids, platform strains for this diverse class of alkaloids do not exist. The key technical hurdle addressed by this project is to engineer strains capable of synthesizing high levels of the common branch point molecule, reticuline, from tyrosine. This project will use synthetic biology tools to improve existing prototype strains by 1) engineering alternative biosynthesis routes to increase pathway flux and bypass bottlenecks, 2) protecting a key unstable building block molecule from degradation by the host cell metabolism, and 3) implementing a spatial engineering approach to promote enzyme access to target substrates. The goal is to generate a platform yeast strain that will be used to target valuable molecules at commercially-relevant titers of greater than 1 g/L. The platform strain also will be used to access previously inaccessible natural benzylisoquinoline molecules, and an even greater number of non-natural derivatives. This technology will broadly transform the approach to provision, discover, and develop needed medicines and drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce cost and loss of productivity due to bacteriophage (phage) contamination in fermentation of dairy and other products.  Bacteriophage contamination is the leading cause of failure in fermentation processes used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The risk of phage contamination in food fermentation processes, particularly in the dairy industry, is significantly enhanced due to a large diversity of suppliers of both the raw ingredient (milk) and the necessary microbial cultures. The current and emerging analytical technologies cannot rapidly detect phages in food materials such as milk. Thus, the combination of the risk of contamination, and the lack of rapid detection methods, results in a significant economic loss for the dairy industry.  Early detection of phage contamination will permit early intervention in the fermentation process, which will lead to significant cost savings.  In addition, the test could be extended to other food areas, pharmaceutical production, and biochemical production.

    The SBIR project addresses the need for rapid detection of phage contamination in a fermentation process through a novel photonic platform. The platform combines nanophotonics, microfluidics, and electrophoresis, and is based on discoveries made at University of California - Davis. The system is focused on the manipulation of charged phages with electrophoresis, and their accelerated amplification in bacteria.  In addition, the system uses electrophoretic capture of phages into a nanophotonic crystal to achieve highly sensitive detection of the target phages. The salient features of the platform are:  a) High-throughput, fast trapping of phages; b) excellent sensitivity and large dynamic range for quantification of phage concentration; and c) scalable design that can be produced at low cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise to the important work of product development and application in a globally competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing guidelines set by each participating company.


    The broader impact of this program is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women, African
    Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having a proactive presence in social media.
