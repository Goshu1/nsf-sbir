The SBIR/STTR Program at the National Science Foundation is committed to assisting Phase II grantees to successfully commercialize their innovation research, grow their company, and to create jobs by attracting new investments and partnerships. To reinforce these commitments, the NSF SBIR/STTR program supports a broad number of supplements and other opportunities.

**Please notify your Program Director of your intention to submit a supplemental funding request before preparing and submitting a proposal.** Supplemental funding is only available for active Phase II grantees.
