## Our philosophy

Since 1977, the NSF seed fund (powered by SBIR/STTR) has helped startups develop their idea and bring them to market. We work with seed-stage companies across all tech sectors — IoT, smart health, robotics, and many more — whose work promises to make a notable social impact.

Inclusivity is central to our philosophy. We seek to fund companies outside of tech hotbeds, and we promote the innovations of women, people of color, and other folks from marginalized groups. 

We offer up to $225k in funding for proof of concept projects and up to $750k in funding for projects that warrant further development; between 2007 and 2016 alone, we funded more than 4,000 proposals. What’s more, we provide the mentorship and event access that sets our founders on the path to success.

## Are you a good fit?

We’re always seeking to support innovative, high-risk work that needs a bit more research and development. We also consider your potential for commercial and social impact — your technology needs to have a good market fit and benefit society.

Sound like you? Check out our portfolio, then submit an executive summary of your work to one of our Program Directors. We’ll provide more insight on whether now is the right time to apply.
