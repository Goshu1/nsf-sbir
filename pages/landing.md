</div>
<div class="usa-width-two-thirds usa-content" markdown="1">
We’re always looking to support innovative, technically risky work that still needs more research and development. As we review applications, we consider your company’s innovativeness, commercial plan, and possible social impact. Your technology needs to have a good market fit and the potential to meaningfully benefit society.

<h3 class="small-header">We embrace diversity</h3>

Great ideas aren’t limited by geography, and we seek to fund companies both inside and outside of the major tech hotbeds. We encourage the work of socially and economically disadvantaged people, first-time entrepreneurs, and folks who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.
