  The [Neural Analytics]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/details/?company=neural-analytics#neural-analytics) Lucid™ M1 transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System is indicated as an adjunct to the standard clinical practices for measuring and displaying cerebral blood flow velocity within the major conducting arteries and veins of the head and neck. Additionally, the Lucid™ M1 System measures the occurrence of transient emboli signals within the blood stream.

### Medical Devices
The Medical Devices subtopic aims to support the early stage development of novel products, processes, or services that will enable the delivery of high-quality, economically-efficient healthcare in the U.S. as well as globally. The MD subtopic is not aimed at supporting or conducting clinical trials, clinical efficacy or safety studies, the development of pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or work performed primarily for regulatory purposes.  Limited studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed in support of feasibility, proof-of-concept studies of early-stage technologies. Proposals that request support for clinical studies will be deemed non-compliant with the SBIR/STTR solicitations and may be returned without review.

### MD1. Medical Devices
Proposed project should focus on using engineering approaches to develop transformative methods and technologies that will solve problems in medicine. Proposed projects may include devices and systems that provide new strategies for the prevention, monitoring, and treatment of health conditions (such as sensors, actuators, implantable and bioelectronic devices for therapeutic monitoring, theranostics, or electroceuticals); advance end-of-life or palliative care; reduce drug counterfeiting; and enable new and more efficient risk-management methods to better address safety issues of drugs and medical devices; motion or structural biomechanical technologies for the improvement of human motion, and sensors, actuators, and intelligent systems for surgical robotics. Proposers are encouraged to form an interdisciplinary team that includes relevant engineering as well as biology/health-related expertise.
