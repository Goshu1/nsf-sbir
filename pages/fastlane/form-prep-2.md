>IMPORTANT: To avoid budget reductions, NSF strongly advises you to visit the Department of Labor/Bureau of Labor Statistics website to >determine the allowed pay scale for each budgeted position. In general, unless your company has other significant internal revenue >sources, as well as recent payroll records showing a precedent for the requested salary, the NSF will not allow budgeted salaries in >excess of the median salary for the same job title in the same geographical area. Click here to search for your city/state data. If your >city is not listed, click here and use your state data. Remember that direct salaries and wages requested in an NSF SBIR/STTR budget are >permitted only for work on R&D tasks.

In most cases, every employee listed in line A or B of the budget should fall under one of the following four occupational groups:
- [Management Occupations (11-0000)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#11-0000)

### Samples

#### PLEASE REVIEW THE SAMPLE BUDGETS AND BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS BELOW

**These sample budgets provide you with the level of detail NSF requires for all SBIR/STTR proposals. Too much information is always better than not enough. If you have questions regarding the budget preparation call the cognizant Program Director for guidance and clarification.**

##### Sample budget populated as PDF:

![PDF of example proposal budget filled out]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fastlane/29-BudgetEx1.jpg)  
![Proposal budget example continued]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fastlane/29-BudgetEx2.jpg)

#### Sample Budget Justification:

_The FastLane system will indicate that the Budget justification should be no more than three pages. Please note that this 3 page limit is waived for the SBIR/STTR program as the solicitation requires thatletters of collaboration from Consultants and Subawardees be included in this section (following thebudget justification document.) Please include pricing documentation for items on lines G.1 and G.6 with an extended cost that exceeds $5000._

**A.1 Senior Personnel**
Dr. Jane Smith, Chief Technical Officer, will work four person-months on the project (line A.1) at an hourly rate of $46.16/hour. (4 months * 173.33hrs/month * $46.16/hr = $32,000).

Mr. John Doe, Senior Engineer, will work 4 person-months on the project (line A.2) at an hourly rate of $36.06/hour. (4 months * 173.33 hrs/month * $36.06/hr = $25,000).

**B. Other Personnel**
Three other personnel will work on the project (line B.2).

An electrical engineer, Mr. Mike Jordan, will spend four months of effort building the prototype amplifier circuitry, at a rate of $25.96/hour. (4 months * 173.33hrs/month * $25.96/hr = $18,000).

Two technicians will spend a total of three months each doing electrical and mechanical characterization, respectively, at a rate of $19.23/hour. (6 months * 173.33hrs/month * $19.23/hr = $20,000).

**C. Fringe Benefits**
Fringe benefits are requested to cover medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees. The fringe benefits rate, based on company records, is approximately 20% of direct labor costs. Therefore, requested fringe benefits are 0.20 * $95,000 (total direct labor) = $19,000.

**E. Travel**
Dr. Smith and Mr. Doe will travel to the Phase I Grantees Workshop in Arlington, VA at an estimated cost of $2,000 per person. Total cost for this trip is $4,000.

**G.1. Materials and Supplies**
The following is a list of materials and supplies to purchase, with quantity, unit cost, and total cost. Items with a total line item cost over $5,000 are justified by inclusion of a quote or pricing documentation with this budget justification.

Chemical precursors: $100/unit, 10 units, $1,000.
Specialized alloys: $200/kg, 5 kg = $1,000.
Specialty compressed gases: $400/cylinder * 15 cylinders = $6,000 (see pricing documentation included as part of this budget justification)
Temperature sensors: $250/unit, 8 units, $2,000.
Printed circuit boards: $200 per board * 10 boards = $2,000
Total budgeted materials and supplies is $10,000.

**G.3. Consultant Services**
Dr. I. D. Snow will be work on the project as a consultant. She will work for a total of 40 days at a rate of compensation of $62.50 per hour ($500/day, which is less than the maximum allowed consultant rate of $600/day). Total requested costs are $20,000. A copy of the signed commitment letter from Dr. Snow is included with this budget justification.

**G.5. Subawards**
One subaward will be executed with Brown University. A signed letter of commitment from the subaward lead, Dr. Fred Johnson, is included in the proposal package. A full subaward budget and budget justification is also included with the proposal. The total subaward amount is $40,000.

**G.6 Other Direct Costs**
We request $1000 for machining costs for prototype fabrication ($100/hour with an estimated 10 hours of machining required). We also have budgeted $1000 for external testing services (4 tests at $250 each) at XYZ Testing Co. The total requested other direct costs are $2,000.

**I. Indirect Costs**
The indirect rate for this project is 20% of total direct salaries and wages, for a total cost of $19,000.
The total fringe plus indirect cost requested for this project is $38,000, which is 40% of total salaries and wages and therefore less than the 50% "safe rate".

**K. Fee**
The fee requested is the maximum allowed rate of 7% of the total direct plus indirect costs (line J). This amounts to a total requested fee of $14,630.
