# About

## Mission and goals

Our program’s mission is to support tech innovation and scientific excellence across the country, getting discoveries out of the lab and into the market. By helping companies transform their disruptive ideas into marketable products, we also promote the nation’s economic growth.

We have four main goals:
- To support technological innovation.
- To help socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs get the footing they need to bring their ideas to life.
- To meet federal research and development needs.
- To promote private-sector commercialization of innovations developed using federal funding.

## About the NSF seed fund

The NSF seed fund* is a program that helps startups commercialize their ideas. We offer companies up to $225k in funding (over a six- to 12-month period) to determine whether their technology is viable and their concepts are marketable. Funding extensions are available for companies that need to conduct additional research and development.
