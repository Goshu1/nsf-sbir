# About

For 40 years, America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF has helped startups and small businesses transform their ideas into marketable products. We focus on the highest-risk technologies — those that show promise but whose success hasn’t yet been validated — and each year, we award nearly $190 million in funding to entrepreneurs across the country. We are a congressionally mandated program — Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR).

### Funding for R&D with founder-friendly terms
</div>

<div class="usa-width-two-thirds" markdown="1">

- **Up to $1.5M / 24+ months.** Receive up to $225,000 in seed capital to conduct product Research and Development (R&D) over six to 12 months. During this period, your company will be immersed in the NSF network and you'll receive training and mentorship in key business areas. A second-round investment of $750,000 over 24 months may be available. NSF may also match 50 cents on every $1 of qualifying revenue or third-party investment, up to another $500,000.

- **0% equity**: You retain full ownership over your company and intellectual property. And because our awards aren’t loans, there’s nothing to pay back.

- **Major societal impact**: We don't have the same financial incentives as most investors, so we can make impact investments that may take longer to provide a financial return. Our goal is to invest in a better future for our shareholders: the American public.

- **Minimal standard reporting**: We provide templates for reporting monthly progress and financials. No need to waste time crafting decks and building spreadsheets — we help you focus on building your product or service instead.

- **Virtual consults with program advisors**: We promote startups in all locations, not just tech hubs. You don’t need to relocate to gain access to our funding or mentors.

- **Less restricted spending**: You can use your funding on employees’ salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, and other R&D costs (though marketing and business development costs aren’t covered).

- **Possible follow-on funding**: Companies that complete Phase I may be eligible for more funding. If you’ve shown that your technology is feasible and needs more development, you can apply to receive an additional $750,000 over two years. And, depending on your circumstances, you could be eligible to apply for up to $500,000 in supplemental funding.

## Program basics

When you decide to apply for funding, you’ll submit a Phase I proposal for up to $225,000, which will cover at least six (and up to 12) months of work. You’ll find out whether your proposal was accepted or declined within four to six months of the proposal deadline.

If you’re awarded Phase I funding, you’ll be expected to:

- Explore product-market fit
- Determine your technology’s feasibility
- Design and test prototypes
- Identify any relevant legal or regulatory issues
- Develop a plan to scale your technology

Applicants often ask whether they can update their research plan during the course of a project, and the answer is yes — with a few stipulations. While it’s OK for you to update your business model or R&D strategy a bit (this is bound to happen), you can’t entirely shift the focus of your work.

If your technology needs more development — and if you’ve met all the Phase I requirements — you can apply for more funding. Phase II awardees receive up to $750,000 over two years.

Phase II awardees can apply for Phase IIB funding to speed up commercialization. To be considered for Phase IIB funding (up to $500,000), you need a third-party investment of at least $100K. Visit our [Supplemental funding page](https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/Supplement/) to learn more.

#### We support small companies and new entrepreneurs

We work with startups and small businesses, and we welcome proposals from newly formed companies — you don’t need a track record of commercialization to apply for funding. Please note that your company needs to be a legal entity before you apply.

If your company is majority owned by a venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private-equity firm, you’re not eligible to apply for funding, although joint ventures and partnerships are eligible. Read more about proposal eligibility in our [Eligibility Guide](https://www.sbir.gov/faqs/eligibility-requirements).

<div class="usa-width-one-half" markdown="1">
#### We support R&D with lots of technical risk

Our seed funding is for R&D that involves a good amount of technical risk. If you’re already sure that your product is technically feasible, this program isn’t a good fit for you.

In selected cases, we support innovations to existing products and services, but these innovations must dramatically change the products’ commercial outcomes. We don’t fund work that simply improves existing products. Check out our [portfolio]({{ '/portfolio/' | relative_url }}) to get a sense of our founders’ work.
