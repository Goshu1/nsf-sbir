# About

## NSF seed fund mission and goals
The NSF seed fund (powered by SBIR/STTR) is a program that helps startups commercialize their ideas. The program features three phases:

- **Phase** I helps businesses determine the technical feasibility and commercial potential of their work. The program offers up to $225k in funding for a six- to 12-month period.
- **Phase** II allows businesses to continue the research and development they started in Phase I, and is contingent on each business’s success during the first phase. Funding normally doesn’t exceed $1 million over a two-year period.
- **Phase III**, which isn’t funded by the NSF seed fund, allows businesses to further pursue commercialization.

Our program’s mission is to support tech innovation and scientific excellence across the country, promoting economic growth.

We have four main goals:
- To support technological innovation.
- To help socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs get the footing they need to bring their ideas to life.
- To meet federal research and development needs.
- To promote private-sector commercialization of innovations developed using federal funding.

## What can the seed fund do for me?
