## About the seed fund

<div class="usa-width-one-third" markdown="1">
### Seed funding for high-risk R&D with founder-friendly terms.
</div>

<div class="usa-width-two-thirds" markdown="1">
- **Up to 1.5M / 24 months.** Receive up to $225,000 in seed capital towards conducting product R&D over a six-month timeframe (up to 12 months depending on the circumstances). During this period, your company will be immersed in the NSF network where you'll receive training and mentorship in key business areas from associated resources.  A second round investment of $750,000 over 24 months may be available.  NSF may also match 50 cents on every $1 of qualifying revenues or third-party investment up to another $500,000.

- **0% equity.** It's non-dilutive "free money" so you retain ownership of your company. It's not a loan so there's nothing to pay back.

- **Early-stage funding for high-risk technology.** While most investors won't back pre-traction companies, we seek to fund nascent, unproven technologies with huge market potential. Then again, most investors don't have access to the National Science Foundation's cadre of scientific domain experts to [conduct technical due diligence](#). It's one reason why receiving NSF funding is often used by early investors as a signal of the technology's promise.

- **We look for societal impact as much as market potential.** Since we don't have the same financial incentives as most investors, we're able to make [impact investments](#) in technology that may be transformative but may not directly provide a financial return. We look to invest in a better future for our shareholders: American taxpayers.

- **Allocate funds any way you want (almost).** Funding may be used for employees’ salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, and other costs related to R&D. Funding may **not** be applied toward sales and marketing, customer development, or market discovery.

- **Standard reporting kept to a minimum.** We provide you templates for reporting monthly progress and financials during the award period. No need to waste time crafting decks and building complex spreadsheets so you can focus on building your product instead.

- **Virtual consultations with program advisors.** We encourage businesses to develop from any location — not just in tech hubs. We don't require companies to uproot their team or relocate their business in order to gain access to funding or mentors.
