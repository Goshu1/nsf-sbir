## Press release information

Are you putting out a press release? If you'd like to mention your NSF award, use this approved description in your press releases and other publications:

### About the National Science Foundation's Small Business Programs

The National Science Foundation (NSF) awards nearly $190 million annually to startups and small businesses through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact. The non-dilutive grants support research and development (R&D) across almost all areas of science and technology helping companies de-risk technology for commercial success. The NSF is an independent federal agency with a budget of about $7 billion that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering. To learn more about the NSF SBIR/STTR program, visit [www.nsf.gov/SBIR](www.nsf.gov/SBIR).

If you'd like to include the NSF logo in your press release, please use [the official version](https://www.nsf.gov/policies/logos.jsp).
