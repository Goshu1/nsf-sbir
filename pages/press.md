## Press release information

Are you putting out a press release? If you'd like to mention your NSF award, use this approved description in your press releases and other publications:

### About the National Science Foundation's Small Business Programs

The National Science Foundation (NSF) awards nearly $190 million annually to startups and small businesses through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact. The non-dilutive grants support research and development (R&D) across almost all areas of science and technology helping companies de-risk technology for commercial success. The NSF is an independent federal agency with a budget of about $7 billion that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering. To learn more about the NSF SBIR/STTR program, visit [www.nsf.gov/SBIR](www.nsf.gov/SBIR).

If you'd like to include the NSF logo in your press release, please use [the official version](https://www.nsf.gov/policies/logos.jsp). 

## The history of NSF SBIR

[Text to go here]

We also have a [one sheet]() covering program basics and points of interest. 

## Same program, new look 

We’re thrilled to announce that the NSF SBIR/STTR program is now America’s Seed Fund (powered by NSF). The details of our program haven’t changed — we’re still offering no-equity funding to small businesses to help them commercialize their high-risk technologies — but our positioning has. 
 
Research revealed that our users wanted an experience that felt more modern and less academic; our choice to change our name to America’s Seed Fund reflects this user need and, we feel, more accurately conveys the benefits of our program. Likewise, our new visual identity, with its bold palette, engaging imagery, and clean typefaces, conveys our values of supporting high-risk technologies, mentoring diverse entrepreneurs, and promoting cutting-edge products and services that will improve Americans’ quality of life. We’ve also updated our site’s content, adopting a more conversational voice to reflect our organization’s openness, and reorganized our site to make information even easier to find.
 
If you have suggestions, we’d love to hear them — share your feedback [via email](sbir@nsf.gov).
