- Your company must be a legal entity at the time you apply for funding.
- At least 50% of your company’s equity must be owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and all funded work needs to take place in the United States (including work done by consultants and contractors).
- The project’s tech lead (Principal Investigator) must be legally employed at least 20 hours a week by the company seeking funding. The tech lead doesn’t need any advanced degrees.
- The tech lead needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of work on a funded project.
- Finally, you can designate a university faculty member as your tech lead only if they can commit to the 50% employment requirement.

To see if your company is a good fit, review our evaluation criteria and consider submitting an executive summary to get feedback from our program directors.

**Criteria**

Here are the criteria we use to determine which companies to fund:

- **Seed stage:** Early-stage company that’s conducting research or prototyping (or both).
- **Pre-traction:** Has identified the market for their product and made customer development efforts, but hasn’t yet created the minimum viable product to solve their target market’s need.
- **High-risk:** The product is based on unproven technology that needs further testing (and funding for that testing).
- **Scale:** If the product is found to be successful, it could have a major social impact and/or venture scale.

**Portfolio**

You can check out our [portfolio](#) to see what companies we’ve recently funded.

**Get pre-submission feedback**

You can send an executive summary to one of our program directors to discuss your work and get feedback. Download our [executive summary form](#) (PDF) and return your completed form to the program director whose topic area best reflects your product’s focus.

**STTR**

If you’re applying for funding for academic research (STTR program), you must partner with an academic, non-profit, or federally funded research institution. If you’re funded through STTR, 30% of your funding must go to your research partner and 40% must go to your company.

**SBIR**

If you’re not applying for funding for academic research (SBIR program), at least 2/3 of the funding you receive must go to your company.

**[Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS number)](#)**<br>
Processing time: Up to five business days<br>
A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.

**[FastLane (NSF’s electronic submission system)](#)**<br>
Processing time: Up to 48 hours<br>
Before applying, you need to register your principal investigator and company in FastLane. Within 48 hours, you’ll get a confirmation email with login instructions. We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.


**[System for Award Management (SAM)](#)**<br>
Processing time: Up to three weeks<br>
Any company that does business with the government needs a SAM account. When you register, you’ll have to share EFT information.

**[SBIR Company Registry](#)**<br>
Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll need to include in your FastLane application.
