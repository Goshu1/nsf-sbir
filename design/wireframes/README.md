# Wireframes

The wireframes are based on the US Web Design Standards framework. It retains the 12-column grid and palette (except it uses green #2e8540 and green-light #4aa564 as the primary interaction colors instead of primary #0071bc and primary darker #205493).  

### Fonts  

We're replacing the default fonts (Merriweather) with Work Sans and Overpass Mono. We selected Work Sans since needed to have some visual continuity with nsf.gov (it's geometrically similar to Arial), but offered more weights, and was better suited various applications. We selected Overpass Mono because we needed a contrasting utility typeface that would also be useful in displaying tabular data.
