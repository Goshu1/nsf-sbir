,,,,,NSF screens proposals,,Usually takes about 1 week,,
,,,,Proposals that do not meet basic specifications are returned without review (RWR),,,"Reasons for RWR: (1) Projects which were submitted late (most of these would not have been able to submit, but some who checked the “exception” box may have to be RWR’ed)
(2) Projects with project descriptions > 15 pages (if the extra pages have no significant content, we will usually let them go to panel, but if it looks like it’s too much to have put on 15 pages, they will be returned)
(3) Projects asking for significantly more than $225,000 (we will make sure that the request is consistent in multiple places in the proposal; if some areas request $225k and other request more, we’ll make a judgement call as to whether it was a typo or intentional)
(4) Some projects which are completely missing a commercial discussion will get flagged by the staff and returned.  If the commercial discussion exists in a weird format, it’ll generally be allowed to go to panel (with the PD consulted in some edge cases)",,
