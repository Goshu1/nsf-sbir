Notes,,"Starting a company needs to be unpacked a bit. (1) What prompted them to start a company? (2) Have they done some level of (a) market validation/customer development (b) product validation at this point? (3) Assumption that starting a company = getting EIN; (4) What other actions do they need to take in order to become a company?
 ","Under what context would they see the ad? What do we want them to do with the ads? What are the conversion metrics?
",How does the target audience learn about NSF SBIR at this stage? Solely through ads?,"(1) There are no events or other time-based content on the site. (Even the submission deadlines tend to be buried.) (2) No system for managing contacts 
",,,,,,,,"Unable to segment subscribers or collect any data-based insight. Only collects email addresses. Low frequency broadcast channel. Primary channel for notifying new solicitation/application deadline.
",,Users did not find the search listings or the available data on the companies very helpful.,,,,,,Some email different PDs and get different answers from each. 10-12% of executive summaries fall through the cracks and are left unanswered. (This is sensitive; a known problem),,Each solicitation only active ~60 days each year.,NSF SBIR is not allowed to conduct these until the solicitation has been posted. Registration captures email.,FAQs need to undergo legal review. Often updated shortly after each new solicitation is published.,(1) Takes 30 days for a free DUNS number or 5 days for a $50 fee.,(1) How long does this process take if you’re starting from scratch?,(1) May take 2-6 weeks turnaround.,(1) Takes 1-2 days turnaround. (2) Need to identify Principal Investigator (PI) ,Info includes: Outline of proposal (structured); Financials / Budget (structured); Refer to  Department of Labor/Bureau of Labor Statistics for salary ranges; Project Summary (structured); Personnel (structured); Resumes / CVs (unstructured); Cover Sheet (structured); Letters of Support (unstructured); Business Model (unstructured); Commercialization history / SBA Certification form (unstructured),"(1) Is there a template or a set of guidelines for this? (2) How is this currently submitted? (3) Can they submit soft copies? (4) Do the letters need to be notarized? I.e., how do you verify/authenticate?",(This is a known pain point as the applicant has to create another account to submit as a research administrator. Applications wind up being disqualified because they are deemed incomplete.),(1) Help Desk receives hundreds of calls during peak period,,,"Usually takes about 1 week. Reasons for RWR: (1) Projects which were submitted late (2) Projects with project descriptions > 15 pages (if the extra pages have no significant content, we will usually let them go to panel, but if it looks like it’s too much to have put on 15 pages, they will be returned) (3) Projects asking for significantly more than $225,000 (4) Some projects which are completely missing a commercial discussion will get flagged by the staff and returned.",,,,,Decisions are final. No protests — but are allowed to submit another Phase I proposal. (1) Do applicants receive additional feedback on why they were rejected?,,,,20% of the money is withheld until the very end of the Phase I period upon receipt of the final report.,,,,,,,,
