Notes,,,(1) What is the motivation for someone to start a company? (2) What other actions do they need to take in order to become a company? (3) How much time/$ does it take to obtain an EIN? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Some email different PDs and get different answers from each. 10-12% of executive summaries fall through the cracks and are left unanswered. (This is sensitive; a known problem),,,Each solicitation only active ~60 days each year.,NSF SBIR is not allowed to conduct these until the solicitation has been posted.,,,,FAQs need to undergo legal review,(1) Takes 30 days for a free DUNS number or 5 days for a $50 fee.,(1) How long does this process take if you’re starting from scratch?,(1) May take 2-6 weeks turnaround.,(1) Takes 1-2 days turnaround. (2) Need to identify Principal Investigator (PI) ,"(1) Is there a template or a set of guidelines for this? (2) How is this currently submitted? (3) Can they submit soft copies? (4) Do the letters need to be notarized? I.e., how do you verify/authenticate?",,,,,,,,,,,,This is a known pain point as the applicant has to create another account to submit as a research administrator. Applications wind up being disqualified because they are deemed incomplete.,(1) Help Desk receives hundreds of calls during peak period,,,Usually takes about 1 week,"Reasons for RWR: (1) Projects which were submitted late (most of these would not have been able to submit, but some who checked the “exception” box may have to be RWR’ed)
(2) Projects with project descriptions > 15 pages (if the extra pages have no significant content, we will usually let them go to panel, but if it looks like it’s too much to have put on 15 pages, they will be returned)
(3) Projects asking for significantly more than $225,000 (we will make sure that the request is consistent in multiple places in the proposal; if some areas request $225k and other request more, we’ll make a judgement call as to whether it was a typo or intentional)
(4) Some projects which are completely missing a commercial discussion will get flagged by the staff and returned.  If the commercial discussion exists in a weird format, it’ll generally be allowed to go to panel (with the PD consulted in some edge cases)",,Applicant has to proactively log in to check status.,,,Decisions are final. No protests — but are allowed to submit another Phase I proposal. (1) Do applicants receive additional feedback on why they were rejected?,,,,20% of the money is withheld until the very end of the Phase I period upon receipt of the final report.,,,,,,,,,,
