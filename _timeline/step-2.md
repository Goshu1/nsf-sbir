title: Register your company
description: You'll need to register your company with 4 different systems.
---
**[Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS number)](#)**<br>
Processing time: Up to five business days<br>
A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.

**[FastLane (NSF’s electronic submission system)](#)**<br>
Processing time: Up to 48 hours<br>
Before applying, you need to register your Principal Investigator and company in FastLane. Within 48 hours, you’ll get a confirmation email with login instructions. We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.


**[System for Award Management (SAM)](#)**<br>
Processing time: Up to three weeks<br>
Any company that does business with the government needs a SAM account. When you register, you’ll have to share EFT information.

**[SBIR Company Registry](#)**<br>
Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll need to include in your FastLane application.
