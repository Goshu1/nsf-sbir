### [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11#1)
**Processing time:** Up to three weeks
 
Any company that does business with the government needs a SAM account. When you register, you’ll have to share bank account information.
 
### [Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS number)](https://iupdate.dnb.com/iUpdate/viewiUpdateHome.htm)
**Processing time:** Up to five business days
 
A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. You’ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because you’re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.
 
### [FastLane (NSF’s electronic submission system)](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/n1/N1AddInst.html)
**Processing time:** Up to 48 hours
 
Before applying, you need to register your principal investigator and company in FastLane. Within 48 hours, you’ll get a confirmation email with login instructions. We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.
 
 
### [SBIR Company Registry](http://sbir.gov/registration)
Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration). Post-registration, you’ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which you’ll need to include in your FastLane application.
